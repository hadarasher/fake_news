Reporters Without Borders calls for Egypt to release Tawfik Ghanem,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 10:37 am",Africa+Egypt+International Organisations+News+Reporters Without Borders (RSF)+UN,"Reporters Without Borders has called on the Egyptian authorities to release Tawfik Ghanem, the former bureau chief of the Anadolu Agency office in Cairo, noting that he had begun his third year in detention without being brought to trial. The organisation stated on its website, signed by the head of its Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, that imprisonment without trial is a common practice in Egypt, where 12 of the 20 imprisoned journalists are being held in pre-trial detention. The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt."" Ghanem has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years, as his provisional detention has been renewed every 15 to 45 days since 26 May, 2021. READ: UN: Malnutrition risk for half a million Yemen children Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Egyptian code of criminal procedure has a two-year limit on pre-trial detention, regardless of the charges. However, Ghanem is still being detained and deprived of medical care. He is 69 years old and suffers from serious health problems, including being diabetic. The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours. The authorities promised to do this but never fulfilled their promise. ""The Egyptian authorities must stop using provisional detention as a punitive tool against journalists. Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

"Russia, Somalia mull establishment of platform for trade cooperation",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 8:11 pm",Africa+Europe & Russia+News+Russia+Somalia,"Somali Foreign Minister, Abshir Omar Jama, said on Friday that he discussed a possibility of creating trade platforms with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting in Moscow, Anadolu Agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Jama said the Russian establishment of such a platform would allow Russian and Somalia trade operators and businesses to interact more effectively and use existing opportunities more efficiently. Lavrov, for his part, said Moscow expressed support for the Somali leadership in state-building, strengthening, unity of the country, steps to stabilise the internal situation and the fight against terrorism and extremism. The progress in this direction will open opportunities for expanding business community cooperation, he said. ""Entrepreneurs of the Russian Federation are interested in the opportunity to come and work together with Somali partners in the field of energy and mining, as well as other promising areas,"" he noted. The Minister stressed that Russia is in favour of ""African solution to African problems,"" and for taking into account the interests of the African continent when addressing the issue of reforming the UN Security Council. According to Lavrov, ""the reform of the UN Security Council should be aimed exclusively at solving the problem of under-representation of developing countries, the countries of the world majority."" Lavrov said he also discussed with Jama the fight against piracy off the coast of Somalia.

Turkiye homes in northern Syria for voluntary return of Syria refugees,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 8:07 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Ankara is currently working on the safe return of Syrian refugees in Turkiye to their country, Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said, as Syrian citizens praise the peaceful atmosphere created in Syria after their voluntary return, Anadolu Agency reports. Erdogan, on Thursday, also noted that ""with the support of Qatar, the work to build houses in Syria, which can accommodate 1 million refugees, continues."" Wafaa Mustafa Hajjaj, a Syrian citizen who lives with her child and nephews in Azaz in the countryside of Aleppo, told Anadolu that she came to Turkiye for treatment after she lost her eyesight in an attack on her village. Hajjaj, who stayed in Turkiye for five years, pointed out that during each stay, Turkish people have always supported her and her family. Hajjaj noted that she voluntarily returned to Syria. An infographic titled ""Falling number of Syrians refugees going home from Jordan, Lebanon"" is created in Ankara, Turkiye on October 25, 2022 [Yılmaz Yücel/Anadolu Agency]0The Syrian citizen hailed the Turkish effort in preparing the infrastructure for the Syrian refugees' return.
""The camp where we reside has water and electricity, and the needs are met through solar energy,"" Hajjaj told Anadolu.
She stressed the safety of the area she currently resides, adding: ""I believe that the rest of the Syrian refugees will return to their homeland whenever security prevails.""
""These areas are now safe because of Turkiye's presence,"" she added.
Turkish Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu, on Wednesday attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the project, ""Voluntary, Safe, Honourable Return Project"" in the northern Syria district of Jarablus, where he said a total of 240,000 houses will be constructed at nine separate locations across the Idlib and Afrin regions in the next three years.
Since 2016, Turkiye has launched four successful anti-terror operations across its border in northern Syria to prevent the formation of a terror corridor and enable peaceful settlement by locals: Euphrates Shield (2016), Olive Branch (2018), Peace Spring (2019) and Spring Shield (2020).
Thanks to these operations, the pace of the return of Syrian refugees from Turkiye to their country has accelerated.
More than 3.7 million Syrians currently reside in Turkiye, making it the world's top refugee-hosting country.
Following the start of a civil war in Syria in 2011, Turkiye adopted an ""open-door"" policy for Syrians fleeing persecution and brutality.
Syria has been embroiled in a vicious civil war since early 2011, when the Bashar Al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and more than 10 million others displaced, according to UN estimates.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. It has made little progress on reforms required by the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol Red Notice.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

Women 'most important heroes' of Turkiye struggle to serve nation: President,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:26 pm",Europe & Russia+News+Turkey,"Turkiye has realised many projects about women to enhance their area of ​​freedom, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, Anadolu Agency reports. ""Over the course of our 40-year-long journey in politics, we have always walked shoulder to shoulder with our women … We have always overcome the obstacles raised before us and the attacks that even reached the point of targeting our lives with the support of women. ""Today, I would like to underline, once again, that women are the most important heroes of our struggle to serve our country and nation,"" Erdogan said at a meeting with women's societies in Istanbul. Turkiye has expanded the areas of freedom, employment and representation of women without any discrimination, he stressed. ""We have increased the rate of women completing at least one level of education from 70 per cent to 88 per cent. We have increased women in employment from 6 million to 10.5 million,"" Erdogan said. The President added that the efforts and labour of women contributed to Turkiye's progress in all areas from economy to trade, from rights and freedoms to agriculture, tourism, education and health. Erdogan also hailed Diyarbakir mothers who continue their sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye. ""I pay my respects to the mothers of Diyarbakir, who have been on the guard for months to take back their children that the separatist organisation forcibly smuggled into the mountains,"" he said. He added that the mothers defy terrorist organisations through their watch for their children. The sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye began in September 2019 in Diyarbakir, when three mothers said their children had been forcibly recruited by YPG/PKK terrorists. The sit-in outside the offices of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) – a party currently facing a closure case, and which the government accuses of having links to the terrorist YPG/PKK – has been growing every day. Demonstrations have also spread to other provinces, including Van, Mus, Sirnak and Hakkari.

Israel mulls imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:14 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Israeli government is considering a bill aimed at imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, local media reported yesterday. According to media reports, the bill states that any nonprofit group that engages in public advocacy two years before or after receiving a donation from a foreign government will lose its status as a public institution and will no longer be eligible for tax exemptions. In addition, those non-profits will be hit with a 65 per cent income tax. The reports indicated that many organisations in Israel and the Palestinian territories depend on foreign funding, and the proposed bill could severely impact their ability to operate. The legislation, drafted by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, Ariel Kallner, is set to be brought before the Knesset's high-level Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday. Kallner said the goal of the tax is to ""prevent foreign interests from gaining the upper hand.""

Anger and fear among Syrians amid Turkiye opposition anti-immigrant campaign,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:08 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Like many Syrians in Turkiye, Ghaith Sameer is awaiting the result of Sunday's election runoff with trepidation, fearing a win for an opposition candidate who promises to swiftly repatriate migrants, Reuters reports. Sameer fled Syria's civil war in 2012 and is now one of over 3.4 million Syrians living in neighbouring Turkiye, where economic woes have aggravated a rising tide of hostility that has washed into the presidential election. ""The opposition's promises frighten me and make me angry, as well, because they make Turkish citizens hate us,"" said Sameer, who took Turkish nationality two years ago and plans to vote on Sunday for President Tayyip Erdogan. While Erdogan has a good chance to win the runoff after falling just short of an outright first-round victory two weeks ago, his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has embraced anti-migrant rhetoric to try to turn the race around. READ: The Syrians in Turkiye are between a rock and a hard place Kilicdaroglu has teamed up with a far-right nationalist party and promised to repatriate all migrants within a year, as posters bearing his face have sprouted across Turkish cities vowing that Syrians will leave. Although Erdogan has been more welcoming to Syrians and other migrants in Turkiye, which has the world's biggest refugee population of 5 million, he has also made moves to accelerate a return of migrants to Syria. For Syrians, the election and the anti-migrant turn in Turkish politics have cast new uncertainty over their future, causing many to wonder if they will have to start again, having already fled a deadly war in their homeland. Sameer, 38, said many of his friends and relatives were putting off plans until after the election when things would be clearer, with his brother even waiting to replace a broken food processor. ""Most Syrians now feel as if the course of their entire lives depends on the results of the elections,"" he lamented. Even though he has Turkish citizenship, Sameer has still been making alternative plans ""in case anything happens"". He has even considered moving with his wife and two small children to a country where conditions for Syrians might be better, such as Egypt or the Kurdish region of Iraq. When Kilicdaroglu announced a deal on Wednesday for far-right Victory Party leader, Umit Ozdag, to back him in the runoff, Ozdag said their promised departure of migrants would lift ""the burden"" on the economy and stop Turkiye becoming ""migrant-istan"". Playing on xenophobic stereotypes that accuse Syrians and Afghan refugees of theft, sexual harassment and other crimes, Ozdag said repatriating migrants would ""make the streets safe again"". Such language and Kilicdaroglu's new anti-migrant posters that hang from lamp posts and over underpasses have been particularly alarming for Syrians. ""Can anyone with even a shred of humanity accept to see signs hanging on the walls of schools and crowded streets threatening to deport Syrians?"" asked Ahmad, a 40-year-old Syrian who, like Sameer, now has Turkish nationality. READ: Is Turkiye democratic enough not to apply forced repatriation and politicising refugees? Ahmad, who withheld his family name fearing repercussions, said he was worried how the signs would affect Syrian children who can read Turkish because they are educated in the language, and described it as ""repulsive and disgusting hate speech"". Most major warfare has been paused in Syria for years, with Turkiye controlling enclaves across the border where it backs rebels against President Bashar Al-Assad and which are already crowded with displaced people from other parts of Syria. Life across the border is brutally hard, with damaged infrastructure, a ravaged economy and the constant threat that war could suddenly erupt again. People in rebel-held territory fear reprisals if the government retakes those areas. With their fate a growing political issue, many Syrians may still feel unease even if Erdogan beats Kilicdaroglu on Sunday, noting his administration's plans for new housing projects across the border to accelerate their eventual repatriation. Like other regional leaders, Erdogan is also mending fences with Assad,  raising the possibility of a rapprochement that could worry many Syrians in Turkiye. Saad Abdalkader, who has lived in Turkiye since 2015, said he could envisage no stability in Syria while Assad held power, and was considering travelling onwards to Europe in search of safety. He recounted an incident when a friend was robbed, but feared he would be assaulted if he went to the police to illustrate the precarious position many Syrians feel themselves to be in Turkiye. Omar Kadkoy, a Syrian working at the Ankara-based economic think tank, TEPAV, said Syrians still faced ""misery and fear"" in their home country, which would feel like a foreign land to their children. ""It isn't an easy decision to make,"" he said of returning voluntarily, adding that for Syrian children in Turkiye: ""They're moulded by everything that is Turkish. To them, Syria is a bed-time story.""

Sudan war spells more disaster for Darfur city on Chad border,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 3:34 pm",Africa+News+Sudan,"When war engulfed Sudan's capital last month, it quickly spread to the western Darfur region, reigniting an old conflict and sending a wave of refugees over the border into Chad, Reuters reports. Nasr Abdullahi sent his wife, sister and five children to Chad last week, staying behind to wait for news of a 17-year-old son in the capital, Khartoum. But when his neighbour's house was burned down and gangs took over the streets, he fled, too. ""I couldn't take it anymore, so I decided to leave on foot,"" the 42-year-old said, after arriving exhausted on Wednesday in the Chadian town of Adre, about 27km (17 miles) from El Geneina, the main city in West Darfur State. ""I crossed through the bush and walked west all night."" Residents link the resurgence of violence in El Geneina and other parts of Darfur to the power struggle between Sudan's Army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Khartoum, which has allowed militias in the area to go unchecked. Those interviewed by Reuters said the attacks since late April in El Geneina were carried out by Janjaweed militias, armed men usually thought to come from Arab nomadic tribes riding trucks, motorcycles and horses – the same militias from which the RSF was born. READ: 18 civilians killed in clashes in Sudan's Darfur: Medics The RSF denies instigating violence in Darfur, instead blaming the Army. The attacks in El Geneina have razed its markets, power grid and medical facilities, witnesses say, reviving memories of the atrocious violence that erupted in the early 2000s. Sudan's Health Ministry says up to 510 people have been killed in the city of about half a million. At least 250,000 people in West Darfur have been internally displaced, while another 90,000 have fled to Chad. With El Geneina's communications now cut off, Abdullahi's account offered a rare glimpse of the chaos. ""Heavy weapons and machine guns are being fired everywhere. When you go out in the morning, you see new bullet holes in the walls,"" he said, adding that water supplies were cut and food was running scarce in the city he left. The feared Janjaweed militias first gained power as the government used them against rebels in Darfur two decades ago. More than 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million displaced. The RSF emerged from them and grew into a large paramilitary force with legal status. Its commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, became deputy head of Sudan's ruling council after helping topple former leader Omar al-Bashir during a popular uprising in 2019. Though conflict in Darfur is often described along ethnic lines, pitting Arab tribes against non-Arabs, it is also rooted in a struggle for land, intensified by climate change. ""This is between the herder and the farmer. It's about resources and land,"" said Sultan Saad Bahreldin, leader of the Masalit tribe, the largest bloc of El Geneina residents. Arab livestock herders migrated to less arid areas during droughts in Darfur in the 1970s and 80s, causing tensions, said Jerome Tubiana, a researcher on the region. They gained more land as the Janjaweed helped government forces drive back rebels in the conflict from 2003. But they felt a 2020 peace deal with some rebel groups, which promised the return of displaced people to their land, ignored their needs. Attacks increased as international peacekeepers withdrew. READ: 85,000 people forced into secondary displacement in Geneina, Sudan: OCHA Five El Geneina residents, most preferring to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation, said by telephone – before lines went down – that they thought the militias aimed to empty the city and that the army had done little to offer protection. Instead, armed Masalit men and members of the Sudanese Alliance, a group that signed the peace deal, fight from within the neighbourhoods they live in. ""The militias attacked anyone present in the city, even if they initially targeted Masalit tribes. Even Arab residents were not safe,"" said Mohamed Aldouma, former governor of the state and member of the Darfur Bar Association, a human rights group. Lawyer, Jamal Abdallah, said that witnesses had told him of one incident in El Geneina where seven people were killed in one home, and another in a makeshift clinic where 12 already injured people and a doctor were gunned down. ""The Janjaweed come into homes and shoot,"" Abdallah added, saying he could see dead bodies and dead animals strewn in the street. Three people living in El Geneina told Reuters that they saw attackers wearing the RSF's beige uniforms. The RSF has, in the past, rebuked individual soldiers for involvement in Janjaweed attacks, but it accuses the Army and allied militias of being behind the latest Darfur violence. Hemedti, who hails from an Arab tribe, called on people in El Geneina in an audio message earlier this week to ""reject regionalism and tribalism. Stop fighting amongst yourselves immediately."" READ: Sudan fighting threatens $50bn Gulf investments An Army spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the Janjaweed militias could not be reached. Attempts to contact leaders of Arab tribes living in the city failed due to the blackout. Enaam Alnour, a local activist, said her brother and several male relatives were killed and her neighbourhood was ""completely destroyed, burned, looted"". She told Reuters from El Geneina that she documented from doctors and witnesses the rape of nine female university students by armed men. Reuters could not verify those incidents. The Sudanese Doctors Union said that all of the city's hospitals were destroyed, as well as its blood bank. Photos shared by a local journalist with Reuters showed drip bottles punctured, rendering them useless. Government buildings, the main market and aid agency offices were looted, witnesses and aid groups said. Though West Darfur is the nation's hungriest state, many farmers are unable to access land or supplies to prepare for the rainy season. At least 85,000 people who had sought refuge after previous attacks inside El Geneina's now-destroyed schools, municipal buildings and mosques are displaced again, said Mathilde Vu, of the Norwegian Refugee Council. It is dangerous for aid workers to deploy, Vu said. ""We are looking at a very bleak future.""

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

Turkiye homes in northern Syria for voluntary return of Syria refugees,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 8:07 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Ankara is currently working on the safe return of Syrian refugees in Turkiye to their country, Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said, as Syrian citizens praise the peaceful atmosphere created in Syria after their voluntary return, Anadolu Agency reports. Erdogan, on Thursday, also noted that ""with the support of Qatar, the work to build houses in Syria, which can accommodate 1 million refugees, continues."" Wafaa Mustafa Hajjaj, a Syrian citizen who lives with her child and nephews in Azaz in the countryside of Aleppo, told Anadolu that she came to Turkiye for treatment after she lost her eyesight in an attack on her village. Hajjaj, who stayed in Turkiye for five years, pointed out that during each stay, Turkish people have always supported her and her family. Hajjaj noted that she voluntarily returned to Syria. An infographic titled ""Falling number of Syrians refugees going home from Jordan, Lebanon"" is created in Ankara, Turkiye on October 25, 2022 [Yılmaz Yücel/Anadolu Agency]0The Syrian citizen hailed the Turkish effort in preparing the infrastructure for the Syrian refugees' return.
""The camp where we reside has water and electricity, and the needs are met through solar energy,"" Hajjaj told Anadolu.
She stressed the safety of the area she currently resides, adding: ""I believe that the rest of the Syrian refugees will return to their homeland whenever security prevails.""
""These areas are now safe because of Turkiye's presence,"" she added.
Turkish Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu, on Wednesday attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the project, ""Voluntary, Safe, Honourable Return Project"" in the northern Syria district of Jarablus, where he said a total of 240,000 houses will be constructed at nine separate locations across the Idlib and Afrin regions in the next three years.
Since 2016, Turkiye has launched four successful anti-terror operations across its border in northern Syria to prevent the formation of a terror corridor and enable peaceful settlement by locals: Euphrates Shield (2016), Olive Branch (2018), Peace Spring (2019) and Spring Shield (2020).
Thanks to these operations, the pace of the return of Syrian refugees from Turkiye to their country has accelerated.
More than 3.7 million Syrians currently reside in Turkiye, making it the world's top refugee-hosting country.
Following the start of a civil war in Syria in 2011, Turkiye adopted an ""open-door"" policy for Syrians fleeing persecution and brutality.
Syria has been embroiled in a vicious civil war since early 2011, when the Bashar Al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and more than 10 million others displaced, according to UN estimates.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. It has made little progress on reforms required by the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol Red Notice.

Israel mulls imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:14 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Israeli government is considering a bill aimed at imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, local media reported yesterday. According to media reports, the bill states that any nonprofit group that engages in public advocacy two years before or after receiving a donation from a foreign government will lose its status as a public institution and will no longer be eligible for tax exemptions. In addition, those non-profits will be hit with a 65 per cent income tax. The reports indicated that many organisations in Israel and the Palestinian territories depend on foreign funding, and the proposed bill could severely impact their ability to operate. The legislation, drafted by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, Ariel Kallner, is set to be brought before the Knesset's high-level Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday. Kallner said the goal of the tax is to ""prevent foreign interests from gaining the upper hand."" Kallner accused European countries of deliberately undermining Israel's interests through their financing activities.

Anger and fear among Syrians amid Turkiye opposition anti-immigrant campaign,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:08 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Like many Syrians in Turkiye, Ghaith Sameer is awaiting the result of Sunday's election runoff with trepidation, fearing a win for an opposition candidate who promises to swiftly repatriate migrants, Reuters reports. Sameer fled Syria's civil war in 2012 and is now one of over 3.4 million Syrians living in neighbouring Turkiye, where economic woes have aggravated a rising tide of hostility that has washed into the presidential election. ""The opposition's promises frighten me and make me angry, as well, because they make Turkish citizens hate us,"" said Sameer, who took Turkish nationality two years ago and plans to vote on Sunday for President Tayyip Erdogan. While Erdogan has a good chance to win the runoff after falling just short of an outright first-round victory two weeks ago, his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has embraced anti-migrant rhetoric to try to turn the race around. READ: The Syrians in Turkiye are between a rock and a hard place Kilicdaroglu has teamed up with a far-right nationalist party and promised to repatriate all migrants within a year, as posters bearing his face have sprouted across Turkish cities vowing that Syrians will leave. Although Erdogan has been more welcoming to Syrians and other migrants in Turkiye, which has the world's biggest refugee population of 5 million, he has also made moves to accelerate a return of migrants to Syria. For Syrians, the election and the anti-migrant turn in Turkish politics have cast new uncertainty over their future, causing many to wonder if they will have to start again, having already fled a deadly war in their homeland. Sameer, 38, said many of his friends and relatives were putting off plans until after the election when things would be clearer, with his brother even waiting to replace a broken food processor. ""Most Syrians now feel as if the course of their entire lives depends on the results of the elections,"" he lamented. Even though he has Turkish citizenship, Sameer has still been making alternative plans ""in case anything happens"". He has even considered moving with his wife and two small children to a country where conditions for Syrians might be better, such as Egypt or the Kurdish region of Iraq. When Kilicdaroglu announced a deal on Wednesday for far-right Victory Party leader, Umit Ozdag, to back him in the runoff, Ozdag said their promised departure of migrants would lift ""the burden"" on the economy and stop Turkiye becoming ""migrant-istan"". Playing on xenophobic stereotypes that accuse Syrians and Afghan refugees of theft, sexual harassment and other crimes, Ozdag said repatriating migrants would ""make the streets safe again"". Such language and Kilicdaroglu's new anti-migrant posters that hang from lamp posts and over underpasses have been particularly alarming for Syrians. ""Can anyone with even a shred of humanity accept to see signs hanging on the walls of schools and crowded streets threatening to deport Syrians?"" asked Ahmad, a 40-year-old Syrian who, like Sameer, now has Turkish nationality. READ: Is Turkiye democratic enough not to apply forced repatriation and politicising refugees? Ahmad, who withheld his family name fearing repercussions, said he was worried how the signs would affect Syrian children who can read Turkish because they are educated in the language, and described it as ""repulsive and disgusting hate speech"". Most major warfare has been paused in Syria for years, with Turkiye controlling enclaves across the border where it backs rebels against President Bashar Al-Assad and which are already crowded with displaced people from other parts of Syria. Life across the border is brutally hard, with damaged infrastructure, a ravaged economy and the constant threat that war could suddenly erupt again. People in rebel-held territory fear reprisals if the government retakes those areas. With their fate a growing political issue, many Syrians may still feel unease even if Erdogan beats Kilicdaroglu on Sunday, noting his administration's plans for new housing projects across the border to accelerate their eventual repatriation. Like other regional leaders, Erdogan is also mending fences with Assad,  raising the possibility of a rapprochement that could worry many Syrians in Turkiye. Saad Abdalkader, who has lived in Turkiye since 2015, said he could envisage no stability in Syria while Assad held power, and was considering travelling onwards to Europe in search of safety. He recounted an incident when a friend was robbed, but feared he would be assaulted if he went to the police to illustrate the precarious position many Syrians feel themselves to be in Turkiye. Omar Kadkoy, a Syrian working at the Ankara-based economic think tank, TEPAV, said Syrians still faced ""misery and fear"" in their home country, which would feel like a foreign land to their children. ""It isn't an easy decision to make,"" he said of returning voluntarily, adding that for Syrian children in Turkiye: ""They're moulded by everything that is Turkish. To them, Syria is a bed-time story.""

Israel university authorities slam bill criminalising the Palestinian flag as 'fascist',Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 3:08 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The authorities across Israel's universities have condemned a bill that would ban flying the flag of Palestine anywhere in Israel, including in academic institutions, reported The Times of Israel. In a letter published yesterday, the Committee of University Heads criticised the bill, that passed a preliminary reading last week as an attempt ""to turn academic institutions into branches of the Israeli Police and the Shin Bet, forcing them to track hundreds of thousands of students on their premises, and to impose punishments on actions that currently are mostly protected by freedom of speech laws."" ""This is politicisation and deep and unreasonable intervention in campus activities. An attempt to use academia for criminal enforcement, turning the institution managers into cops, judges and even executioners – when dealing with offences that have nothing to do with academia,"" the university heads added. The proposal for the law, put forward by the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, stipulates that three or more people waving the flag of a ""hostile entity"" will be considered a crime and, therefore, punishable by up to one year in prison. READ: China calls on Israel to stop encroaching on Palestinian land According to Haaretz, the bill, which requires three additional votes to pass, will also enable Israel authorities to criminalise and disband protests held by Palestinians. In a separate statement, the President of Tel Aviv University, Ariel Porat, slammed the proposal as ""fascist"" and said he will not follow the law's clause ordering the permanent expulsion of students who display the Palestinian flag. He wrote: ""The Palestinian Authority is not an enemy state and is not a terror organisation. Waving the Palestinian flag is an act that is protected under freedom of expression. If we are to act according to this law, we would probably have to ban most of our students, who would rightly object to this form of oppression and will not hesitate to wave the Palestinian flag."" The bill comes after Israel's Knesset parliament passed the preliminary reading of a controversial bill last year that would ban flying the Palestinian flag in state-funded institutions. It also comes after Israeli settlers staged the flag march through Jerusalem's Old City last week to mark what they call the unification of Jerusalem, in reference to Israel's occupation of the city in 1967. The letter, which was sent to members of Israel's Council for Higher Education, is set to be discussed in the cabinet meeting on Sunday.

"Israel mulls bill to annex 'parks, natural reserves' in occupied West Bank",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 1:47 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Israeli Ministerial Committee for Legislation Affairs will discuss on Sunday an amendment to the law on national parks, nature reserves, national sites and memorials, which aims to impose Israeli law on such sites in the occupied West Bank, Haaretz newspaper reported. The bill, submitted by Knesset member Danny Danon of the Likud Party, authorises the interior minister to declare sites in those areas as national sites rather than the defence minister, who currently has that power. ""The lands of Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] are full of heritage sites of great national and historical importance to the development of settlement in the Land of Israel,"" the proposal's explanatory note said. ""We must recognise the history of the Jewish people that can be found in every clod of earth in Judea and Samaria,"" it added. According to the paper, if the Knesset approves the bill, it will lead to the annexation of other areas.

European trade union to boycott products made in Israel settlements,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 1:11 pm",EU+International Organisations+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), which represents over 45 million European workers and their trade unions, decided today to boycott products made in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. The organisation also stressed the importance of regulatory measures to prevent EU legal entities from importing or exporting products manufactured in illegal Israeli settlements in accordance with EU treaties and international law. The decision came during the confederation's 15th Congress, being held in the German capital Berlin today. Addressing the conference, the Secretary-General of the Palestine Trade Union Federation, Shaher Saad, welcomed the attendees and drew attention to the plight of the Palestinians as he noted the death toll so far this year, which has already reached 172 Palestinians. ""Israel has been transformed entirely under the leadership of the far-right government to a hothouse and incubator of racism, terrorism and unbridled settler violence,"" he said.

According to the Wafa news agency, the confederation emphasised the need to reach an agreement between Israel and Palestine that would lead to the implementation of the two-state solution, with East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state and the establishment of a lasting solution that respects the legitimate rights of both peoples to coexist in security and peace. Saad added in his speech: ""Many of the members of this conference witnessed some of the suffering that our male and female workers suffer at military checkpoints and in the unjust Israeli labour market, and the guests of the Palestinians turned from visitors into eyewitnesses to these crimes and violations, after they showed the necessary feelings of solidarity."" ""No two people in this world can no longer disagree that the foreign occupation of other people's lands is the calamity of all mankind and its black plague,"" he continued. ""If there is anything on earth that deserves condemnation, rejection, and denunciation, it is the continuation of the Israeli occupation of Palestine, that occupation that pays our disarmed people the cost of their existence and brutality, and curbs their unbridled lust for licking the blood of innocent people and taking their lives,"" he added. ""If this international community had any will, it would have brought the Israeli occupation state to the platform of accountability, after its killing of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, and imposed on it the repulsive penalties it deserves, as it is a rogue state that continued to deviate from the law.""

Hamas chief hails Islamic Bloc victory in Birzeit student council,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 9:15 am",Middle East+News+Palestine,"The head of Hamas' Political Bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, has hailed the victory of the Hamas-affiliated Islamic Wafa bloc in the Birzeit University's student union election saying it represents an ""extension"" of the movement's balanced presence at various levels and areas. Speaking over the phone to participants in the celebrations organised by the bloc yesterday, Haniyeh said the victory carries three important messages including that Hamas is ""unbreakable"" in the West Bank and in all the homeland, and is capable of confronting the ""occupier, oppression and terrorism"". ""The second message is that the bloc has proven its ability to adapt to changes, overcome complexities, and fill the void created by arrests, martyrdom, or deportation,"" Haniyeh said, adding that the third message is that ""participation in the elections stemmed from national competition, and on the basis of adhering to partnership with all forces and factions."" He reiterated the movement's adherence to holding the general presidential and legislative elections as well as those for the PLO National Council and student union elections in all universities in the Gaza Strip. On Wednesday, the Wafa bloc won 25 seats out of the 51 in the Student Union Council in the Birzeit student union elections. Last week, the Islamic bloc won a majority of 40 seats at An-Najah National University in Nablus, in the northern occupied West Bank, while Fatah's Shabiba bloc won 38 seats.

Iran says it has successfully test-launched ballistic missile,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 8:49 pm",Asia & Americas+International Organisations+Iran+Israel+Middle East+News+UN+US,"Iran successfully test-launched a ballistic missile with a potential 2,000-km range on Thursday, state media said, two days after the chief of Israel's Armed Forces raised the prospect of ""action"" against Tehran over its nuclear programme, Reuters reports. Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, says its weapons are capable of reaching the bases of arch-foes, Israel and the United States, in the region. Despite US and European opposition, the Islamic Republic has said it will further develop its ""defensive"" missile programme. ""Our message to Iran's enemies is that we will defend the country and its achievements. Our message to our friends is that we want to help regional stability,"" Iranian Defence Minister, Mohammadreza Ashtiani, said. State TV broadcast a few seconds of footage of what it said was the launch of an upgraded version of Iran's Khoramshahr 4 ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km (1,243 miles) and able to carry a 1,500-kg (3,300-pound) warhead. READ: Iran unveils new ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 kilometres The state news agency, IRNA, said the liquid-fuel missile had been named the ""Kheibar"", a reference to a Jewish castle overrun by Muslim warriors in the early days of Islam. ""The domestically built Kheibar missile's outstanding features include quick preparation and launch time, which makes it a tactical weapon in addition to a strategic one,"" it said. US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said, ""Iran's development and proliferation of ballistic missiles poses a serious threat to regional and international security and remains a significant non-proliferation challenge."" Iran was continuing to seek missile technology from foreign suppliers and conducting tests in defiance of a UN Security Council resolution, Miller told reporters at a regular press briefing, adding that Washington would continue to use tools including sanctions to counter those efforts. Israel, which the Islamic Republic does not recognise, sees Iran as an existential threat. Iran says its ballistic missiles are an important deterrent and retaliatory force against the United States, Israel and other potential regional adversaries. An Israeli military spokesperson said the military does not comment on such matters. On Tuesday, the top Israeli General mooted possible military action against Iran as efforts by six world powers to revive Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal have stalled since last September, amid growing Western fears about Tehran's accelerating nuclear advances. The deal, which Washington ditched in 2018 under then President Donald Trump, had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear activities that extended the time Tehran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to do so.

Kuwait to continue ban on visas for Philippines workers after talks fail to resolve labour dispute,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 8:46 pm",Asia & Americas+Kuwait+Middle East+News+Philippines,"Kuwait is maintaining a ban it imposed on issuing visas for workers from the Philippines amid an ongoing labour row between the two countries which talks have failed to resolve. After Filipino authorities alleged failure to comply with a labour agreement it previously reached with Kuwait, the Gulf nation suspended the issuance of all visas for Filipino workers earlier this month. According to Kuwait, the ban was imposed in response to ""wrong practices"" made by the Philippines' embassy in the country and the alleged crimes committed by some members of the Filipino community against Kuwaitis. Amongst the reported violations listed by Kuwait's Public Authority of Manpower (PAM) were attempts to get domestic labour recruitment offices to withdraw Filipino house workers from Kuwaitis' households on the pretext that their employment contracts were completed, putting pressure on employers to renew contracts with undesirable conditions, and circumventing competent agencies in Kuwait by directly contacting Kuwaiti citizens and recruitment offices to check on matters with the Philippines' embassy. In addition, PAM cited the ""inappropriate treatment"" of Kuwaiti citizens who were checking with the Philippines' embassy upon its request, and the embassy was also accused of sheltering Filipino workers who violated Kuwait's residency law or were registered as absentees. From the Philippines' side, however, it has for years insisted that its workers in the small Gulf nation face abuse and poor treatment, forcing Manila to demand greater rights for their citizens. READ: Philippines halts sending domestic workers to Kuwait after maid's murder In a statement by PAM, Kuwait's First Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister, Talal Al Khalid, asserted that ""Kuwait's sovereignty and its people's dignity are a red line"". The statement added that Kuwait is committed to international accords signed with the Philippines and the renewal of Filipinos' valid residency permits. In talks this month, requested by the Filipino government, Kuwait set a number of conditions for resolving the dispute, including the embassy's acknowledgment of having committed violations and infringing Kuwaiti laws, and for it to make an official pledge to not repeat them in the future. Kuwait also requested that it notify the Philippine government of the acknowledgment and the pledge, and to have them published in official media Only after then, Kuwait said, would its Interior Ministry evaluate the situation, as well as follow up on the embassy's abidance by security regulations for at least three months before deciding what it sees fit to do. The Filipino delegation asked for 72 hours to check with its government on the conditions set by the Kuwaiti side, which were rejected by Manila. As a result, Kuwait has said that its decision to suspend the issuance of all visas for Filipinos will continue ""until further notice"", with First Deputy Prime Minister, Al Khalid, directing PAM to coordinate with the Foreign Ministry to reach agreements with other countries for the provision of skilled workers to Kuwait.

He indicated China's increasing role in the issue, as with others in the region, and the possibility of surpassing the United States as a mediatory force and hegemon. Supposedly referring to the US, he stated that ""the country with major influence on the parties concerned should make concrete efforts to advance the Middle East peace process and should not unjustifiably prevent the Security Council from arriving at the minimum consensus on the Palestine-Israeli issue"". The Chinese diplomat's remarks came as the Israeli government yesterday approved the proposed state budget for 2023-2024, which allocates around 3.5 billion Israeli shekels ($941 million) for the illegal settlement projects and the upgrading of their infrastructure. Current estimates report that there are around 700,000 illegal settlers living in 164 settlements and 116 outposts in the Occupied West Bank and Occupied East Jerusalem, with that set to expand as Tel Aviv frequently approves thousands of more settlement units.

France says Iran ballistic test worrying in light of nuclear escalation,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 5:31 pm",Asia & Americas+Europe & Russia+France+IAEA+International Organisations+Iran+Middle East+News+UN+US,"France, on Thursday, accused Iran of violating a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the 2015 nuclear deal after it carried out a long-range ballistic missile test, which Paris said was worrying given ""uninterrupted escalation"" of Tehran's nuclear programme, Reuters reports. Iran successfully test-launched a ballistic missile with a potential 2,000-km range on Thursday, state media said, the latest in ballistic missile tests and satellite launches. ""These activities are all the more worrying in the context of the continuing escalation of Iran's nuclear programme"", French Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Anne-Claire Legendre, told reporters at a daily briefing. UN Security Council resolution 2231 calls on Iran not to conduct ""any activity"" related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, but the language is ambiguous, leaving it open to interpretation. Western officials say that, although the launches go against 2231, they are not a violation of the core nuclear agreement between Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. READ: Top Israel General says 'action' is on horizon over Iran nuclear work Western powers are particularly concerned because UN Security Council restrictions on missiles and related technologies last until October 2023, after which Iran is free to pursue its ballistic missile activity. Legendre's reference to the escalation of Iran's nuclear programme comes just 10 days before the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors meets in Vienna. ""Iran's activities pose serious and increased non-proliferation risks without any credible civilian justification,"" she said. Ahead of the board meeting in March, the IAEA and Iran said they had agreed to make progress on various issues, including a long-stalled IAEA inquiry into uranium particles found at three undeclared sites in Iran. They also agreed to re-install all extra monitoring equipment, such as surveillance cameras, at nuclear sites that was put in place under Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, but then removed last year as the deal unravelled following the US withdrawal in 2018. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. It is unclear how much progress there has been and whether Western powers will decide to push for a resolution ordering Iran to cooperate more. ""We expect Iran to respect its international obligations … and carry out concrete and tangible progress before the Board of Governors meeting,"" Legendre said.

"Israel allocates $941m from state budget to expand, upscale illegal settlements",Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 3:08 pm",International Organisations+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+UN,"The Israeli Knesset yesterday approved the new state budget for the next two years which includes investing 3.5 billion shekels ($941 million) into expanding Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank. According to the Times of Israel, the majority of the funds will go towards paving new roads and improving existing ones, including highways to bypass Palestinian areas that further segregate Israeli settlers and Palestinians. Moreover, hundreds of millions of shekels have been allocated to approve illegal settlements which have never received government authorisation. The total funds from the allocated budget to upgrade and pave new roads in the occupied West Bank have been agreed between Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Transportation Minister Miri Regev. They decided from this amount, to allocate a sum of $134 million towards expanding a road between the Ariel settlement and Tapuach Junction in the northern West Bank; $98 million to upgrade the access road to the Beit El Regional Council area. READ: Israel to impose 65% tax on human rights groups critical of the occupation state They also agreed to contribute $81 million from the budget to finance a new road between the illegal settlement of Migron and Qalandia north of Jerusalem, which will bypass Qalandia refugee camp and confiscate thousands of acres of Palestinian-owned lands. Additionally, hundreds of millions more were allocated for roads in and around East Jerusalem. The investment comprises 25 per cent of the Transportation Ministry's budget for road infrastructure in the entire country, reported the Times of Israel, despite the population in the illegal settlements comprising just five per cent of Israel's nearly ten million citizens. Smotrich celebrated the budget approved by the Israeli Knesset as ""excellent."" Meanwhile, Yoni Mizrachi, a researcher with Peace Now, said: ""All Israeli governments prioritise the West Bank settlements in the budget, but this government has gone even further and has taken money from core funds and given it to a small group living in the West Bank which in a political agreement with the Palestinians Israel will leave."" ""We are seeing an effort here to deepen Israel's presence in the West Bank,"" he added. On 30 March, the United Nations Human Rights Council discussed a report on settlements and their repercussions on the Palestinian people's rights, presented by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk. In his report, Turk emphasised that ""the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, increased from 520,000 to more than 700,000 over the past decade."" The report documented the existence of a relationship between Israeli settlement expansion and settler attacks against Palestinians over the past decade, noting that the United Nations has verified 3,372 incidents of settler violence, which resulted in the injury of 1,222 Palestinians.

Hundreds of Israel settlers storm Al-Aqsa Mosque compound,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 2:00 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+Videos & Photo Stories,"Hundreds of Israeli settlers, on Thursday, forced their way into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Occupied East Jerusalem under heavy protection from the Israeli forces to mark a Jewish holiday, Anadolu News Agency reports. In a statement, the Islamic Endowments Department in Jerusalem said 252 Israeli settlers broke into the Al-Aqsa Mosque courtyard through the Mughrabi Gate in the western wall of the Mosque, expecting more settlers to storm the Mosque courtyard in the afternoon. Israeli groups earlier called on settlers to intensify their storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex to mark the Jewish Shavuot holiday on Thursday and Friday. The department added that the Israeli police also restricted the entry of Palestinians since the dawn prayer. Since 2003, Israel has been allowing settlers into the compound almost daily. For Muslims, Al-Aqsa represents the world's third-holiest site. Jews, for their part, call the area the Temple Mount, claiming it was the site of two ancient Jewish temples. Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. It annexed the entire city in 1980 in a move never recognised by the international community.

Israel to impose 65% tax on human rights groups critical of the occupation state,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 1:56 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"A new bill is being proposed which will grant Israel powers to extend its crackdown on human rights groups. The Ministerial Committee on Legislation will put forward a plan on Sunday to impose a tax on 65 per cent of foreign donations to Israeli and Palestinian humanitarian and human rights groups. The bill fulfils one of the promises made to the far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit party by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of their coalition agreement at the end of last year. Lawyers warned against the plan at the time and said that the move is similar to steps taken against human rights organisations in undemocratic countries. According to the deal, the government will pass the law 180 days after it is sworn in. If adopted, as is thought likely, the new tax will have a serious impact on human rights groups and NGOs. Some of Israel's most prominent and best-known rights organisations, including Breaking the Silence, B'Tselem, Peace Now and Yesh Din, rely on foreign funding from the European Union and US. In 2021, B'Tselem joined other major human rights group in branding Israel as an apartheid state. Michael Sfard, the legal adviser to Yesh Din, an organisation that acts to protect the rights of Palestinians in the West Bank, warned against the bill in December: ""If this section passes, it will be a fatal blow to the human rights community in Israel. This is a similar step to those taken against human rights organisations in undemocratic countries such as Poland, Hungary and Russia. The inspiration comes from [Vladimir] Putin and [Victor] Orban."" Sfard explained that the bill is intended to paralyse the activities of groups that criticise Israeli policies targeting the Palestinians. He added that the move by the extreme far-right Israeli government will not harm right-wing organisations such as Kohelet and Elad because, unlike human rights groups, most of the donations they receive from overseas come from private individuals and bodies whose interests, in general, are not concerned with promoting democracy and human rights. READ: The humanitarian paradigm is an act of political violence against Palestinians The US is reported to have conveyed its strong opposition to the legislation. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said yesterday that the US ""supports the central role of NGOs as part of civil society"" which are ""critical to democratic and responsive transparent government."" Germany's Ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, said on Twitter today that the bill ""is a matter of grave concern to us and to many of Israel's international partners."" He added that Germany intends to ""continue to raise the issue with our Israeli friends."" The Bill has also been denounced by the French Embassy. A spokesperson is reported as saying that the legislation is ""deeply concerning"" and emphasising the ""critical role of civil society in the life of every democracy."" Experts highlighting Israel's steady drift towards authoritarianism pointed to the fact that, globally since the 1940s, official humanitarian and development assistance has generally been exempted from taxation. The introduction of taxation of this sort by Israel would, therefore, stand apart from normal good practice by a state and act as a disincentive for donors to support Israeli and Palestinian civil society. Should this happen, the resources of organisations critical to the provision of humanitarian relief and human rights protection would be depleted beyond recovery. Last year, Israel's crackdown on human rights groups saw the apartheid state accuse six NGOs which defend Palestinian rights of ""terrorism"". The decision was met with universal condemnation, and seventeen European countries said that they would continue to support the Palestinian NGOs.

According to the Lebanese state news agency, NNA, Jumblatt, 73, has called a party conference for 25 June to choose his successor. He called on his party's general secretariat to complete the relevant procedures of the elections process to elect a new successor for the post, it added. In 1977, Jumblatt became the PSP leader following the assassination of his father, Kamal, during the 15-year Lebanese civil war. After his father's assassination, he also inherited the leadership of the Druze community in Lebanon, making him one of the most important public figures on the Lebanese political scene. PSP has a parliamentary bloc, known as the Democratic Gathering bloc, of nine lawmakers headed by his son, Taymur Jumblatt. Lebanon has been unable to elect a new president since October 2022 to replace former President, Michel Aoun, amid differences among political rivals.

Israel exerts effort to avoid being included in UN blacklist,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 12:56 pm",International Organisations+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+UN,"Israeli Major General Ghassan Alian and Israeli Envoy to the UN Gilad Erdan met on Tuesday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to persuade him not to add Israel to the blacklist of countries and groups abusing children during conflict. The Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) reported that Alian gave Guterres information relevant to Palestinian minors allegedly injured by errant missiles fired from Gaza that fell short into Gazan territory. He also gave Guterres alleged ""evidence"" that a number of Palestinian minors killed in Israeli operations have substantial ties to terror groups, thereby distorting the picture painted in UN reports. ""The secretary-general was also provided with examples of the incitement to terror that is rampant within the Palestinian Authority, both on social media and Internet networks and in schools, which in turn cause a high level of children and teenagers to be involved in terrorist activities,"" a statement from Israeli mission to the UN said. The UN report names notorious terror organisations such as Daesh, Al-Qaeda and Boko Haram for the harm perpetrated on children. A 2021 report warned that Israel would be added to the list should Palestinian minor casualty numbers rise in 2022, the JNS reported, as 80 Palestinian children were subject to mistreatment by Israeli occupation forces. It also stated that the Israeli occupation rejected 1,800 applications for Palestinian children who needed medical treatment abroad. In addition, the Israeli occupation, according to the report, killed 53 Palestinian children in 2022. Erdan said in a statement: ""We presented the secretary-general with clear data proving that the majority of Palestinian minors killed in the past year were involved in acts of violence and terrorism, and this information was omitted from the UN data."" He also said that they presented Guterres with ""the fact that terrorist organisations use Palestinian children as human shields, and fire missiles and rockets from densely populated areas."" Erdan claimed that it is the Palestinians who should be added to the blacklist for the death of their children at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces. ""Whoever is responsible for the incitement and recruitment of minors for murder and terrorism is the one who should be included on the blacklist, not the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], which is the most moral army in the world,"" he claimed.

The organisation stated on its website, signed by the head of its Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, that imprisonment without trial is a common practice in Egypt, where 12 of the 20 imprisoned journalists are being held in pre-trial detention. The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt."" Ghanem has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years, as his provisional detention has been renewed every 15 to 45 days since 26 May, 2021. READ: UN: Malnutrition risk for half a million Yemen children Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Egyptian code of criminal procedure has a two-year limit on pre-trial detention, regardless of the charges. However, Ghanem is still being detained and deprived of medical care. He is 69 years old and suffers from serious health problems, including being diabetic. The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours. The authorities promised to do this but never fulfilled their promise. ""The Egyptian authorities must stop using provisional detention as a punitive tool against journalists. Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019.

A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

Turkiye has expanded the areas of freedom, employment and representation of women without any discrimination, he stressed. ""We have increased the rate of women completing at least one level of education from 70 per cent to 88 per cent. We have increased women in employment from 6 million to 10.5 million,"" Erdogan said. The President added that the efforts and labour of women contributed to Turkiye's progress in all areas from economy to trade, from rights and freedoms to agriculture, tourism, education and health. Erdogan also hailed Diyarbakir mothers who continue their sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye. ""I pay my respects to the mothers of Diyarbakir, who have been on the guard for months to take back their children that the separatist organisation forcibly smuggled into the mountains,"" he said. He added that the mothers defy terrorist organisations through their watch for their children. The sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye began in September 2019 in Diyarbakir, when three mothers said their children had been forcibly recruited by YPG/PKK terrorists. The sit-in outside the offices of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) – a party currently facing a closure case, and which the government accuses of having links to the terrorist YPG/PKK – has been growing every day. Demonstrations have also spread to other provinces, including Van, Mus, Sirnak and Hakkari.

Israel mulls imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:14 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Israeli government is considering a bill aimed at imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, local media reported yesterday. According to media reports, the bill states that any nonprofit group that engages in public advocacy two years before or after receiving a donation from a foreign government will lose its status as a public institution and will no longer be eligible for tax exemptions. In addition, those non-profits will be hit with a 65 per cent income tax. The reports indicated that many organisations in Israel and the Palestinian territories depend on foreign funding, and the proposed bill could severely impact their ability to operate. The legislation, drafted by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, Ariel Kallner, is set to be brought before the Knesset's high-level Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday. Kallner said the goal of the tax is to ""prevent foreign interests from gaining the upper hand."" Kallner accused European countries of deliberately undermining Israel's interests through their financing activities.

Anger and fear among Syrians amid Turkiye opposition anti-immigrant campaign,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:08 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Like many Syrians in Turkiye, Ghaith Sameer is awaiting the result of Sunday's election runoff with trepidation, fearing a win for an opposition candidate who promises to swiftly repatriate migrants, Reuters reports. Sameer fled Syria's civil war in 2012 and is now one of over 3.4 million Syrians living in neighbouring Turkiye, where economic woes have aggravated a rising tide of hostility that has washed into the presidential election. ""The opposition's promises frighten me and make me angry, as well, because they make Turkish citizens hate us,"" said Sameer, who took Turkish nationality two years ago and plans to vote on Sunday for President Tayyip Erdogan. While Erdogan has a good chance to win the runoff after falling just short of an outright first-round victory two weeks ago, his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has embraced anti-migrant rhetoric to try to turn the race around. READ: The Syrians in Turkiye are between a rock and a hard place Kilicdaroglu has teamed up with a far-right nationalist party and promised to repatriate all migrants within a year, as posters bearing his face have sprouted across Turkish cities vowing that Syrians will leave. Although Erdogan has been more welcoming to Syrians and other migrants in Turkiye, which has the world's biggest refugee population of 5 million, he has also made moves to accelerate a return of migrants to Syria. For Syrians, the election and the anti-migrant turn in Turkish politics have cast new uncertainty over their future, causing many to wonder if they will have to start again, having already fled a deadly war in their homeland. Sameer, 38, said many of his friends and relatives were putting off plans until after the election when things would be clearer, with his brother even waiting to replace a broken food processor. ""Most Syrians now feel as if the course of their entire lives depends on the results of the elections,"" he lamented. Even though he has Turkish citizenship, Sameer has still been making alternative plans ""in case anything happens"". He has even considered moving with his wife and two small children to a country where conditions for Syrians might be better, such as Egypt or the Kurdish region of Iraq. When Kilicdaroglu announced a deal on Wednesday for far-right Victory Party leader, Umit Ozdag, to back him in the runoff, Ozdag said their promised departure of migrants would lift ""the burden"" on the economy and stop Turkiye becoming ""migrant-istan"". Playing on xenophobic stereotypes that accuse Syrians and Afghan refugees of theft, sexual harassment and other crimes, Ozdag said repatriating migrants would ""make the streets safe again"". Such language and Kilicdaroglu's new anti-migrant posters that hang from lamp posts and over underpasses have been particularly alarming for Syrians. ""Can anyone with even a shred of humanity accept to see signs hanging on the walls of schools and crowded streets threatening to deport Syrians?"" asked Ahmad, a 40-year-old Syrian who, like Sameer, now has Turkish nationality. READ: Is Turkiye democratic enough not to apply forced repatriation and politicising refugees? Ahmad, who withheld his family name fearing repercussions, said he was worried how the signs would affect Syrian children who can read Turkish because they are educated in the language, and described it as ""repulsive and disgusting hate speech"". Most major warfare has been paused in Syria for years, with Turkiye controlling enclaves across the border where it backs rebels against President Bashar Al-Assad and which are already crowded with displaced people from other parts of Syria. Life across the border is brutally hard, with damaged infrastructure, a ravaged economy and the constant threat that war could suddenly erupt again. People in rebel-held territory fear reprisals if the government retakes those areas. With their fate a growing political issue, many Syrians may still feel unease even if Erdogan beats Kilicdaroglu on Sunday, noting his administration's plans for new housing projects across the border to accelerate their eventual repatriation. Like other regional leaders, Erdogan is also mending fences with Assad,  raising the possibility of a rapprochement that could worry many Syrians in Turkiye. Saad Abdalkader, who has lived in Turkiye since 2015, said he could envisage no stability in Syria while Assad held power, and was considering travelling onwards to Europe in search of safety. He recounted an incident when a friend was robbed, but feared he would be assaulted if he went to the police to illustrate the precarious position many Syrians feel themselves to be in Turkiye. Omar Kadkoy, a Syrian working at the Ankara-based economic think tank, TEPAV, said Syrians still faced ""misery and fear"" in their home country, which would feel like a foreign land to their children. ""It isn't an easy decision to make,"" he said of returning voluntarily, adding that for Syrian children in Turkiye: ""They're moulded by everything that is Turkish. To them, Syria is a bed-time story.""

Sudan war spells more disaster for Darfur city on Chad border,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 3:34 pm",Africa+News+Sudan,"When war engulfed Sudan's capital last month, it quickly spread to the western Darfur region, reigniting an old conflict and sending a wave of refugees over the border into Chad, Reuters reports. Nasr Abdullahi sent his wife, sister and five children to Chad last week, staying behind to wait for news of a 17-year-old son in the capital, Khartoum. But when his neighbour's house was burned down and gangs took over the streets, he fled, too. ""I couldn't take it anymore, so I decided to leave on foot,"" the 42-year-old said, after arriving exhausted on Wednesday in the Chadian town of Adre, about 27km (17 miles) from El Geneina, the main city in West Darfur State. ""I crossed through the bush and walked west all night."" Residents link the resurgence of violence in El Geneina and other parts of Darfur to the power struggle between Sudan's Army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Khartoum, which has allowed militias in the area to go unchecked. Those interviewed by Reuters said the attacks since late April in El Geneina were carried out by Janjaweed militias, armed men usually thought to come from Arab nomadic tribes riding trucks, motorcycles and horses – the same militias from which the RSF was born. READ: 18 civilians killed in clashes in Sudan's Darfur: Medics The RSF denies instigating violence in Darfur, instead blaming the Army. The attacks in El Geneina have razed its markets, power grid and medical facilities, witnesses say, reviving memories of the atrocious violence that erupted in the early 2000s. Sudan's Health Ministry says up to 510 people have been killed in the city of about half a million. At least 250,000 people in West Darfur have been internally displaced, while another 90,000 have fled to Chad. With El Geneina's communications now cut off, Abdullahi's account offered a rare glimpse of the chaos. ""Heavy weapons and machine guns are being fired everywhere. When you go out in the morning, you see new bullet holes in the walls,"" he said, adding that water supplies were cut and food was running scarce in the city he left. The feared Janjaweed militias first gained power as the government used them against rebels in Darfur two decades ago. More than 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million displaced. The RSF emerged from them and grew into a large paramilitary force with legal status. Its commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, became deputy head of Sudan's ruling council after helping topple former leader Omar al-Bashir during a popular uprising in 2019. Though conflict in Darfur is often described along ethnic lines, pitting Arab tribes against non-Arabs, it is also rooted in a struggle for land, intensified by climate change. ""This is between the herder and the farmer. It's about resources and land,"" said Sultan Saad Bahreldin, leader of the Masalit tribe, the largest bloc of El Geneina residents. Arab livestock herders migrated to less arid areas during droughts in Darfur in the 1970s and 80s, causing tensions, said Jerome Tubiana, a researcher on the region. They gained more land as the Janjaweed helped government forces drive back rebels in the conflict from 2003. But they felt a 2020 peace deal with some rebel groups, which promised the return of displaced people to their land, ignored their needs. Attacks increased as international peacekeepers withdrew. READ: 85,000 people forced into secondary displacement in Geneina, Sudan: OCHA Five El Geneina residents, most preferring to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation, said by telephone – before lines went down – that they thought the militias aimed to empty the city and that the army had done little to offer protection. Instead, armed Masalit men and members of the Sudanese Alliance, a group that signed the peace deal, fight from within the neighbourhoods they live in. ""The militias attacked anyone present in the city, even if they initially targeted Masalit tribes. Even Arab residents were not safe,"" said Mohamed Aldouma, former governor of the state and member of the Darfur Bar Association, a human rights group. Lawyer, Jamal Abdallah, said that witnesses had told him of one incident in El Geneina where seven people were killed in one home, and another in a makeshift clinic where 12 already injured people and a doctor were gunned down. ""The Janjaweed come into homes and shoot,"" Abdallah added, saying he could see dead bodies and dead animals strewn in the street. Three people living in El Geneina told Reuters that they saw attackers wearing the RSF's beige uniforms. The RSF has, in the past, rebuked individual soldiers for involvement in Janjaweed attacks, but it accuses the Army and allied militias of being behind the latest Darfur violence. Hemedti, who hails from an Arab tribe, called on people in El Geneina in an audio message earlier this week to ""reject regionalism and tribalism. Stop fighting amongst yourselves immediately."" READ: Sudan fighting threatens $50bn Gulf investments An Army spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the Janjaweed militias could not be reached. Attempts to contact leaders of Arab tribes living in the city failed due to the blackout. Enaam Alnour, a local activist, said her brother and several male relatives were killed and her neighbourhood was ""completely destroyed, burned, looted"". She told Reuters from El Geneina that she documented from doctors and witnesses the rape of nine female university students by armed men. Reuters could not verify those incidents. The Sudanese Doctors Union said that all of the city's hospitals were destroyed, as well as its blood bank. Photos shared by a local journalist with Reuters showed drip bottles punctured, rendering them useless. Government buildings, the main market and aid agency offices were looted, witnesses and aid groups said. Though West Darfur is the nation's hungriest state, many farmers are unable to access land or supplies to prepare for the rainy season. At least 85,000 people who had sought refuge after previous attacks inside El Geneina's now-destroyed schools, municipal buildings and mosques are displaced again, said Mathilde Vu, of the Norwegian Refugee Council. It is dangerous for aid workers to deploy, Vu said. ""We are looking at a very bleak future.""

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

"New York City law school under fire for 'silencing' criticism of Israel""",Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 12:50 pm",Asia & Americas+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+US,"The City University of New York (CUNY) School of Law has come under fire for censoring a pro-Palestine commencement speech which highlighted Israel's brutal treatment of Palestinians. Yemeni American Fatima Mohammed was selected by her peers, including members of the CUNY Jewish Law Students' Association, to give the student commencement speech earlier this month. Although the speech was livestreamed, like all the commencement speeches for the past nine years, the video of Mohammed's address — which she gave while draped in the famous Palestinian keffiyeh — has been removed from the school's YouTube page, apparently without explanation. ""Israel continues to indiscriminately rain bullets and bombs on worshippers, murdering the old, the young, attacking even funerals and graveyards, and as it encourages lynch mobs to target Palestinian homes and businesses, as it imprisons its children, as it continues its project of settler-colonialism, expelling Palestinians from their homes, carrying [out] the ongoing Nakba,"" said Mohammed. She described the unique nature of CUNY Law and explained that students enrolled at the New York school need ""to be equipped with the necessary legal skills to protect [our] communities, to protect the organisers fighting endlessly day in and day out… and confront the systems of oppression that rend violence on them."" In her address, Mohammed indicated that graduating from CUNY with the relevant legal skills will ensure that the ""exception"" which exists in addressing the injustices suffered by Palestinians can be challenged. ""Palestine can no longer be the exception to our pursuit of justice."" The backlash against Palestine solidarity: MEMO in conversation with Dr Hil Aked Students and activists say that Mohammed's speech was taken off YouTube because she paid attention to the plight of the Palestinians. There are media reports that CUNY Law removed the video due to false allegations of anti-Semitism. Since her speech, Mohammed has come under attack from Zionist groups. According to the CUNY Jewish Law Students' Association, which released a statement in support of Mohammed, calling her ""our friend and classmate,"" the notorious anti-Palestine group Canary Mission has been ""spreading disgusting lies"". ""We, as Jewish students at CUNY Law, oppose and condemn the racist organisations like Canary Mission which are spreading disgusting lies about our friend,"" said the Jewish Law Students' Association. ""The organisations currently attacking Fatima and the rest of CUNY Law's student body, with absurd and false claims of anti-Semitism, are doing so against the wishes of the majority of CUNY Law's Jewish students, who wholeheartedly stand with Fatima and have been grateful to have her as our classmate throughout law school."" The association added that, ""As Jewish students attending an institution structured around social justice, we denounce both the murder and dispossession enacted in our name through the Zionist project and the harassment and lies that Zionist organisations are using to punish Fatima for her bravery and commitment to Palestinian freedom."" More than 15 CUNY Law student groups, including the Jewish Law Students' Association, condemned CUNY Law's decision to take down the video, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CUNY Law is also being accused of taking down and censoring last year's student commencement speech by Nerdeen Kiswani. Both speeches were given by Muslim women and highlighted the suffering of Palestinians. ""We strongly condemn the apparent decision by CUNY Law to remove Fatima Mohammed's commencement speech, particularly considering its focus on social justice and the plight of the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation,"" said CAIR in a statement issued about the ongoing ""silencing"" of voices that seek to shed light on human rights abuses committed by Israel.

Iraq army digging trench around refugee camp in Kurdish region,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 12:44 pm",Iraq+Middle East+News,"The Iraqi army has commenced an operation to dig a trench and establish security observation points around the Makhmour refugee camp, which hosts hundreds of families of members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The camp is situated on the border between the provinces of Nineveh and Erbil, neighbouring Turkiye says the camp has become a recruiting venue for PKK militants. Iraqi forces started a deployment operation in the town of Makhmour, located approximately 105 kilometres southeast of Mosul and 70 kilometres west of Erbil. The camp houses over 1,500 families from the Kurdish regions of Turkiye, who are relatives of the PKK militants. The PKK has been involved in an armed struggle for independence against the Turkish state. The new Iraqi action aims to restrain the PKK's practices within the camp, such as recruitment operations that the targeting of teenagers and young people within the camp, hiding of weapons and establishing electronic media cells that serve the party, which is classified as a terrorist group by Turkiye, the EU and the US. A senior Iraqi official in Baghdad told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed yesterday that the engineering units in the Iraqi army began to establish a security trench around the camp, with the installation of surveillance towers and specific entry and exit gates. This, the official added, comes ""after the PKK incited the camp's residents to attack the army and prevent it from entering the camp."" The Iraqi move is expected to be met with Turkish satisfaction, especially after a series of security meetings between the two countries in which Ankara expressed its concern that the camp may become a centre of military activities for the PKK. Turkish forces have previously carried out several air strikes within the camp, which is established in an area extending up to 20 kilometres, constructed of stone and brick, and houses at least 12,000 people. The United Nations and European organisations have built a health centre, a school and some facilities for its residents. In early June 2021, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened that his country would ""cleanse"" the Makhmour camp. He stated that ""the camp had become a safe haven for the PKK militants"", explaining that it serves as an ""incubator for PKK militants and this must be addressed.""

Iran warns Israel against attacks on its nuclear facilities,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 9:51 am",Iran+Israel+Middle East+News,"An Iranian official on Tuesday warned Israel against attacking Tehran's nuclear facilities, noting such a move would lead to a war. Speaking to Al Jazeera, the Iranian official said: ""We do not seek war, but the world must understand we have lines, that there are no red lines when it comes to our response to Israel."" This came following remarks made by Chief of Staff of Israeli Army, Herzi Halevi, who warned that the ""negative developments"" on the Iranian nuclear front ""could lead to action against Iran."" Halevi's statements, the Iranian official said, amount to official terrorism, accusing the international community of tolerating it. ""They reflect the depth of Israel's internal problems,"" he stressed, adding that Israeli threats would not change the course of its nuclear programme. He, however, denied Israeli claims that Tehran is enriching uranium above the 60 per cent level. At the same time, he reiterated that Iran is continuous in the development of its military capabilities in all fields, noting this frustrates Israel. But he said: ""We do not have in our military creed any place for nuclear weapons."" The Iranian official's comments came after Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned: ""All options must be on the table to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.""

Kuwait court upholds its decision to dissolve 2022 parliament,Unknown,"May 25, 2023 at 9:04 am",Kuwait+Middle East+News,"Kuwait's Constitutional Court yesterday upheld a March ruling that a September 2022 parliamentary election, in which the opposition made gains, was void, by rejecting an appeal against that decision,Â ReutersÂ reported. This means 6 June legislativeÂ electionsÂ will go ahead. The head of the court, Fouad Al-Zuwaid, said: ""The court decided to reject the appeal"" which had been filed by members of the 2022 parliament, who said the court had exceeded its powers by declaring parliament void. After the 2022 parliament was dissolved in March, parliament wasÂ reinstatedÂ with the composition of the 2020 elections – which itself had been previously dissolved in a bid to end political feuding. However, in May it was again dissolved by royal decree in order for fresh elections to take place in June.

Palestinian student elections provide rare test of voter mood,Unknown,"May 24, 2023 at 8:54 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"Candidates linked to the group, Hamas, won the largest share of seats on a University Student Council on Wednesday, in a ballot that offered a rare test of voter sentiment for Palestinians, who had their last parliamentary elections almost two decades ago, Reuters reports. In a campus festooned with green, red and yellow political banners, the Hamas-affiliated list won 25 seats on the 51-seat Birzeit University Student Council, against 20 for the group associated with Fatah, the party of President Mahmoud Abbas. With no parliamentary elections since 2006, the process is also a check on the political pulse of a geographically and politically divided Palestinian nation, as speculation mounts over the future of its octogenarian President. Abbas was elected in 2005 and has ruled by decree for some 14 years since his mandate expired. READ: Israel has killed 20 journalists since 2001, but nobody has been held to account Recent polls show almost 80 per cent of Palestinians want Abbas to resign and growing support for armed groups. But, with both the Israeli military and the Palestinian Authority curbing political activity, students say university campuses are among the few places in the West Bank that remain relatively open for organising. ""It is the only place where we can exercise our democratic right and vote,"" said Anan Safi, a 20 year-old graphic design student, who voted for the list associated with the socialist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). ""We don't have presidential or national elections."" Iyad Tomar, Head of the Election Committee and Dean of students at Birzeit, said the elections were an opportunity to strengthen democratic values among the young. The elected council will represent student interests. ""What makes the election at Birzeit University significant is that it reflects the different political perspectives in Palestinian society,"" he said. For 20 year-old computer science student, Loor Azem, family affiliations helped persuade her to vote for Fatah, which has historically dominated at Birzeit. In recent years, however, as the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority has seen its popularity dive, the student branch of the party has also struggled against the Hamas-affiliated bloc. The group, which does not allow elections in Gaza universities, has used the student polls across the West Bank as an opportunity to consolidate its presence in the West Bank. Earlier this month, the Islamist list won student elections at An-Najah University in Nablus, the largest in the West Bank.

The decision follows discussions held between Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, and Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on the sidelines of the Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum in Bangkok in November last year, according to statements from Canada and Saudi Arabia. ""Punitive trade measures will be lifted,"" said a Canadian government source familiar with the agreement who was not authorised to speak on the record.

READ: Saudi executes fourth detainee in less than 24 hours The 2018 row pre-dated the killing of journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, later that year, which Canada and all Western countries condemned. It started when Canada's embassy in Riyadh published a tweet in Arabic urging the immediate release of women's rights activists held by Saudi Arabia. That prompted Riyadh to recall its ambassador and bar the envoy from returning, and to institute a ban on new trade. Wednesday's decision stems from ""the desire for both sides to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect and common interests,"" the statements said. The normalisation comes as the Saudi Prince, known as MbS, seeks to reassert Saudi Arabia as a regional power by using his place atop an energy giant in an oil-dependent world consumed by the war in Ukraine.

This statement came during a visit by a delegation of European ambassadors and consuls to the Palestinian towns of Sebastia and Burqa in the northern West Bank. ""Legalising the return of settlers to evacuated outposts in the northern West Bank is contrary to the decisions of Israel's Supreme Court and to international law,"" von Burgsdorff told reporters. ""All forms of settlements are illegal,"" he added.

US imprisons ex-Hezbollah spy for photographing popular landmarks for potential attacks,Unknown,"May 24, 2023 at 6:00 pm",Asia & Americas+Iran+Lebanon+Middle East+News+US,"Authorities in the United States have sentenced to 12 years in prison a man linked to the Iran-backed militant group, Hezbollah, who had reportedly photographed American landmarks for potential attacks. 46-year-old Alexei Saab, a software developer based in New Jersey, was arrested back in 2019 on suspicion of having ties to the Iran-backed and Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant movement, with prosecutors at a trial last year accusing him of being a highly trained terrorist who scoped out landmarks in the US, France, Turkiye and the Czech Republic. According to those prosecutors, Saab acted as a sleeper cell waiting to become operational within the US if Washington attacked Tehran in a potential conflict. In preparation for such an operation, he reportedly took photographs of and researched weak points in landmarks, particularly in the US, providing the information to Hezbollah. Those landmarks included the Empire State Building, the World Trade Centre, the Rockefeller Centre, Grand Central Station, along with airports, bridges and tunnels within New York alone. At the sentencing yesterday, the jury convicted Saab of receiving military-type training from Hezbollah, conspiring to commit marriage fraud and making false statements. It was not able to reach a verdict regarding the charge of Saab gathering material support for a terrorist group, however, and it acquitted him of three other charges. READ: US charges alleged Hezbollah financier with sanctions evasion The judge, Paul G. Gardephe, noted that the defendant has been cooperative with authorities throughout the investigation and case, fully allowing Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) agents to interview him in 2019, 11 times over four months, with him being able to go home each time until his arrest after his 12th session. Gardephe revealed that the ""facts and circumstances"" indicate that Saab no longer posed a danger to the community and that there was little risk he would commit any further crimes. He supported the initial argument that Saab should serve no more than a decade in prison, and asserted that he has become a model prisoner by helping other convicts at New York City's federal jails to get high school equivalency certificates, learn English and find relief from psychological problems. According to his defence attorney, Marlon Kirton, Saab had gone through a significant transformation after arriving in the US at the age of 23, as he ""began to experience the feeling of true freedom"". He reportedly ""loved how Americans lived passionately and fearlessly"", and decided he wanted that. He then became an American citizen by 2005 and obtained two master's degrees, and still feared Hezbollah but ""felt safe in the United States, knowing that the organisation could not touch him"". Gardephe stated that Saab's change of heart and the ""peaceful and productive"" life he lived afterward present ""inconvenient facts"" that made it impossible to grant the US government's request that he be incarcerated for 20 years.

Turkiye to continue its assistance to Palestine health sector,Unknown,"May 24, 2023 at 5:18 pm",Europe & Russia+International Organisations+Middle East+News+Palestine+Turkey+UN,"Turkiye will continue its assistance to the Palestinian health sector, the country's first Under-Secretary of Permanent Representative to the UN Geneva Office said on Wednesday, Anadolu News Agency reports. Ankara will do this ""through direct investment, the hospitals in Gaza and Tubas, medical assistance and offering training,"" Serdar Ozkan said during his address at the draft bill discussions on the health conditions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including east Jerusalem, and the Occupied Syrian Golan. The discussions took place as part of the 76th edition of the World Health Assembly. Noting that Turkiye granted $16 million to the state budget of Palestine in the last five years, Ozkan stressed that Ankara also continues to provide political, financial, and in-kind support to UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). ""We extend $10 million of contribution each year,"" he said. READ: Turkiye joins International Conference on Great Lakes Region He added that Turkiye also has assistance programs for Palestine through the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA), Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) and Red Crescent.

Underlining that his country will continue to provide assistance to Palestine and UNRWA, Ozkan reiterated Turkiye's call to the international community to channel further assistance to the Agency. ""The international community also needs to increase its assistance to the State of Palestine to support Palestinian people's economic and social conditions, including a sustainable health system,"" he urged. He said the Occupation in Palestine is not only preventing Palestine from using its own national resources and thus building a sustainable financial environment, including for its health services, but it also hinders access to healthcare services in many other ways.

"Israel has killed 20 journalists since 2001, but nobody has been held to account",Unknown,"May 24, 2023 at 3:39 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+Videos & Photo Stories,"On the first anniversary of the killing of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh by an Israeli sniper in Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, it is clear that her killing was not an isolated incident, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said. The CPJ's report documented 20 cases in which the Israeli army killed journalists in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, but has never assumed responsibility for any of them, meaning that nobody has been held to account. Several American news agencies have conducted independent investigations into the killing of Abu Akleh, including the New York Times, the Washington Post and Associated Press, as well as Dutch research collective Bellingcat, and the CPJ. They all concluded that lethal fire was launched by the Israeli army. CNN found evidence of a deliberate attack, while the research group Forensic Architecture based in London and Al-Haq human rights group in Ramallah found evidence that an Israeli soldier fired at Abu Akleh and her colleagues with the intention to kill them. According to the military correspondent of the Times of Israel, Amir Ben David, ""Months after the tragedy of Shireen's killing, the Israeli army's investigation concluded that there was a 'high probability' that one of the soldiers fired 'by mistake' at her during a shooting at Palestinian militants."" In a report translated by Arabi21, Ben David said that the Israeli army killed 18 Palestinian journalists and European foreign correspondents without prosecuting any soldier or acknowledging its responsibility for the deaths. ""The Israeli army,"" he added, ""consistently claims that its soldiers are under attack and the fatal shots are fired in retaliation… The army provides no evidence to support its conclusions. In some cases, it classifies journalists as terrorists, and in other cases, the killing of journalists is not investigated at all."" The head of the Foreign Press Association in Israel, Guillaume Lavallee, pointed out that, ""Most Israelis do not care about the death of Palestinians, even if they are journalists."" This has created a very dangerous environment for local and foreign correspondents, many of whom fear being targeted by Israeli soldiers. ""If it is possible to kill a journalist with an American passport, like Shireen, without legal consequences, the rest of the journalists fear that they could easily meet the same fate."" After the Israeli attack on the Freedom Flotilla in 2010, when nine Turkish citizens were killed on board the MV Mavi Marmara, the Chief Military Prosecutor at the time, Avichai Mandelblit, realised that a problem was emerging with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. It was feared that some Israelis, including senior officials, could be arrested, which is why the Turkel Commission was established and experts in international law were brought in from abroad. ""Israel was obliged to meet international standards."" When Abu Akleh was killed, international pressure was intense, so Israel could not employ its usual evasive strategies. It acknowledged, hesitantly, that it was not intentional, and expressed regret. However, no one has been prosecuted, because there is no incentive for anyone in Israel to be prosecuted for killing a journalist; any conviction would ruin their life. ""Fifty occupations may be closed for them in civilian life for 17 years if found guilty."" The CPJ report confirms that Israel's targeting of Palestinian and foreign journalists is a carefully calculated political and security strategy which reflects state policy.

"Red Sea epidemic kills off sea urchins, imperilling coral",Unknown,"May 24, 2023 at 3:27 pm",Africa+Egypt+Israel+Jordan+Middle East+News+Saudi Arabia,"A deadly epidemic that is spreading through the Red Sea has killed off an entire species of sea urchin in the Gulf of Aqaba, imperilling the region's uniquely resilient coral reefs, an Israeli research team has found, Reuters reports. The whole population of black sea urchins, a species known for helping keep coral reefs healthy in the waters also known as the Gulf of Eilat, was wiped out over a couple months, according to a team from Tel Aviv University. Their findings, published in two peer-reviewed journals, cite mass mortality in other countries in the region, including Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The probable culprit is a disease-causing ciliate parasite that brings with it a fast death – perhaps the same one that has wreaked havoc on sea urchin populations in the Caribbean. In just two days, a healthy Diadema setosum – a long-spined black sea urchin – becomes a skeleton with massive tissue loss, said lead researcher, Omri Bronstein, from Tel Aviv University's Steinhardt Museum of Natural History and School of Zoology. Some wash ashore, dead. Others are eaten by fish, likely speeding up contagion. The first signs of trouble appeared in the Mediterranean Sea, where the sea urchins have, over the years invaded, probably through the Suez Canal, and made their home. Bronstein said there were reports several months ago from Greece and Turkiye of sea urchin deaths. READ: Microalgae brought from Antarctica to be tested during Turkiye 1st manned space voyage While that was less concerning, at first, since they were an invasive species, the pathogen has now crossed back into the natural population in the Red Sea. ""There is nothing that can be done to stop this at the moment,"" Bronstein said. But there is a ""very narrow window"", he said, to create an isolated population, or broodstock, of the sea urchins remaining elsewhere, that could hopefully be reintroduced later on. The researchers say a report to Israeli environmental authorities has been submitted and that emergency steps to protect the coral reefs are being examined. Eilat, an Israeli resort town on the Red Sea's northern shore, is a popular spot for scuba diving. Scientists studying the area consider it a coral refuge. The corals that settled thousands of years ago had to pass through a narrow strait to the south that acted as a thermal barrier, ensuring they are more resistant to temperature increases that are threatening reefs globally. The sea urchins play an important role in maintaining balance by feeding on algae that would otherwise block sunshine and smother the reefs. ""Coral stand no chance competing with algae. That's why we need sea urchins,"" he said. ""Without this species, as we've seen – this is not imagination, we've seen it happening in front of our eyes – it is not a good future.""

During a hearing on Monday at the Hadera Magistrate's Court, the soldier's detention was extended until next Sunday, in addition to being denied access to a lawyer. In response, the soldier's family expressed their concern, stating: ""It is a shame that this is how soldiers are treated in the State of Israel.""

Reporters Without Borders calls for Egypt to release Tawfik Ghanem,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 10:37 am",Africa+Egypt+International Organisations+News+Reporters Without Borders (RSF)+UN,"Reporters Without Borders has called on the Egyptian authorities to release Tawfik Ghanem, the former bureau chief of the Anadolu Agency office in Cairo, noting that he had begun his third year in detention without being brought to trial. The organisation stated on its website, signed by the head of its Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, that imprisonment without trial is a common practice in Egypt, where 12 of the 20 imprisoned journalists are being held in pre-trial detention. The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt."" Ghanem has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years, as his provisional detention has been renewed every 15 to 45 days since 26 May, 2021. READ: UN: Malnutrition risk for half a million Yemen children Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Egyptian code of criminal procedure has a two-year limit on pre-trial detention, regardless of the charges. However, Ghanem is still being detained and deprived of medical care. He is 69 years old and suffers from serious health problems, including being diabetic. The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours. The authorities promised to do this but never fulfilled their promise. ""The Egyptian authorities must stop using provisional detention as a punitive tool against journalists. Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

Speaking at a news conference, Jama said the Russian establishment of such a platform would allow Russian and Somalia trade operators and businesses to interact more effectively and use existing opportunities more efficiently.

Turkiye homes in northern Syria for voluntary return of Syria refugees,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 8:07 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Ankara is currently working on the safe return of Syrian refugees in Turkiye to their country, Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said, as Syrian citizens praise the peaceful atmosphere created in Syria after their voluntary return, Anadolu Agency reports. Erdogan, on Thursday, also noted that ""with the support of Qatar, the work to build houses in Syria, which can accommodate 1 million refugees, continues."" Wafaa Mustafa Hajjaj, a Syrian citizen who lives with her child and nephews in Azaz in the countryside of Aleppo, told Anadolu that she came to Turkiye for treatment after she lost her eyesight in an attack on her village. Hajjaj, who stayed in Turkiye for five years, pointed out that during each stay, Turkish people have always supported her and her family. Hajjaj noted that she voluntarily returned to Syria. An infographic titled ""Falling number of Syrians refugees going home from Jordan, Lebanon"" is created in Ankara, Turkiye on October 25, 2022 [Yılmaz Yücel/Anadolu Agency]0The Syrian citizen hailed the Turkish effort in preparing the infrastructure for the Syrian refugees' return.
""The camp where we reside has water and electricity, and the needs are met through solar energy,"" Hajjaj told Anadolu.
She stressed the safety of the area she currently resides, adding: ""I believe that the rest of the Syrian refugees will return to their homeland whenever security prevails.""
""These areas are now safe because of Turkiye's presence,"" she added.
Turkish Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu, on Wednesday attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the project, ""Voluntary, Safe, Honourable Return Project"" in the northern Syria district of Jarablus, where he said a total of 240,000 houses will be constructed at nine separate locations across the Idlib and Afrin regions in the next three years.
Since 2016, Turkiye has launched four successful anti-terror operations across its border in northern Syria to prevent the formation of a terror corridor and enable peaceful settlement by locals: Euphrates Shield (2016), Olive Branch (2018), Peace Spring (2019) and Spring Shield (2020).
Thanks to these operations, the pace of the return of Syrian refugees from Turkiye to their country has accelerated.
More than 3.7 million Syrians currently reside in Turkiye, making it the world's top refugee-hosting country.
Following the start of a civil war in Syria in 2011, Turkiye adopted an ""open-door"" policy for Syrians fleeing persecution and brutality.
Syria has been embroiled in a vicious civil war since early 2011, when the Bashar Al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and more than 10 million others displaced, according to UN estimates.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. It has made little progress on reforms required by the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol Red Notice.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

Women 'most important heroes' of Turkiye struggle to serve nation: President,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:26 pm",Europe & Russia+News+Turkey,"Turkiye has realised many projects about women to enhance their area of ​​freedom, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, Anadolu Agency reports. ""Over the course of our 40-year-long journey in politics, we have always walked shoulder to shoulder with our women … We have always overcome the obstacles raised before us and the attacks that even reached the point of targeting our lives with the support of women. ""Today, I would like to underline, once again, that women are the most important heroes of our struggle to serve our country and nation,"" Erdogan said at a meeting with women's societies in Istanbul. Turkiye has expanded the areas of freedom, employment and representation of women without any discrimination, he stressed. ""We have increased the rate of women completing at least one level of education from 70 per cent to 88 per cent. We have increased women in employment from 6 million to 10.5 million,"" Erdogan said. The President added that the efforts and labour of women contributed to Turkiye's progress in all areas from economy to trade, from rights and freedoms to agriculture, tourism, education and health. Erdogan also hailed Diyarbakir mothers who continue their sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye. ""I pay my respects to the mothers of Diyarbakir, who have been on the guard for months to take back their children that the separatist organisation forcibly smuggled into the mountains,"" he said. He added that the mothers defy terrorist organisations through their watch for their children. The sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye began in September 2019 in Diyarbakir, when three mothers said their children had been forcibly recruited by YPG/PKK terrorists. The sit-in outside the offices of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) – a party currently facing a closure case, and which the government accuses of having links to the terrorist YPG/PKK – has been growing every day. Demonstrations have also spread to other provinces, including Van, Mus, Sirnak and Hakkari.

Israel mulls imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:14 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Israeli government is considering a bill aimed at imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, local media reported yesterday. According to media reports, the bill states that any nonprofit group that engages in public advocacy two years before or after receiving a donation from a foreign government will lose its status as a public institution and will no longer be eligible for tax exemptions. In addition, those non-profits will be hit with a 65 per cent income tax. The reports indicated that many organisations in Israel and the Palestinian territories depend on foreign funding, and the proposed bill could severely impact their ability to operate. The legislation, drafted by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, Ariel Kallner, is set to be brought before the Knesset's high-level Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday. Kallner said the goal of the tax is to ""prevent foreign interests from gaining the upper hand.""

Anger and fear among Syrians amid Turkiye opposition anti-immigrant campaign,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:08 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Like many Syrians in Turkiye, Ghaith Sameer is awaiting the result of Sunday's election runoff with trepidation, fearing a win for an opposition candidate who promises to swiftly repatriate migrants, Reuters reports. Sameer fled Syria's civil war in 2012 and is now one of over 3.4 million Syrians living in neighbouring Turkiye, where economic woes have aggravated a rising tide of hostility that has washed into the presidential election. ""The opposition's promises frighten me and make me angry, as well, because they make Turkish citizens hate us,"" said Sameer, who took Turkish nationality two years ago and plans to vote on Sunday for President Tayyip Erdogan. While Erdogan has a good chance to win the runoff after falling just short of an outright first-round victory two weeks ago, his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has embraced anti-migrant rhetoric to try to turn the race around. READ: The Syrians in Turkiye are between a rock and a hard place Kilicdaroglu has teamed up with a far-right nationalist party and promised to repatriate all migrants within a year, as posters bearing his face have sprouted across Turkish cities vowing that Syrians will leave. Although Erdogan has been more welcoming to Syrians and other migrants in Turkiye, which has the world's biggest refugee population of 5 million, he has also made moves to accelerate a return of migrants to Syria. For Syrians, the election and the anti-migrant turn in Turkish politics have cast new uncertainty over their future, causing many to wonder if they will have to start again, having already fled a deadly war in their homeland. Sameer, 38, said many of his friends and relatives were putting off plans until after the election when things would be clearer, with his brother even waiting to replace a broken food processor. ""Most Syrians now feel as if the course of their entire lives depends on the results of the elections,"" he lamented. Even though he has Turkish citizenship, Sameer has still been making alternative plans ""in case anything happens"". He has even considered moving with his wife and two small children to a country where conditions for Syrians might be better, such as Egypt or the Kurdish region of Iraq. When Kilicdaroglu announced a deal on Wednesday for far-right Victory Party leader, Umit Ozdag, to back him in the runoff, Ozdag said their promised departure of migrants would lift ""the burden"" on the economy and stop Turkiye becoming ""migrant-istan"". Playing on xenophobic stereotypes that accuse Syrians and Afghan refugees of theft, sexual harassment and other crimes, Ozdag said repatriating migrants would ""make the streets safe again"". Such language and Kilicdaroglu's new anti-migrant posters that hang from lamp posts and over underpasses have been particularly alarming for Syrians. ""Can anyone with even a shred of humanity accept to see signs hanging on the walls of schools and crowded streets threatening to deport Syrians?"" asked Ahmad, a 40-year-old Syrian who, like Sameer, now has Turkish nationality. READ: Is Turkiye democratic enough not to apply forced repatriation and politicising refugees? Ahmad, who withheld his family name fearing repercussions, said he was worried how the signs would affect Syrian children who can read Turkish because they are educated in the language, and described it as ""repulsive and disgusting hate speech"". Most major warfare has been paused in Syria for years, with Turkiye controlling enclaves across the border where it backs rebels against President Bashar Al-Assad and which are already crowded with displaced people from other parts of Syria. Life across the border is brutally hard, with damaged infrastructure, a ravaged economy and the constant threat that war could suddenly erupt again. People in rebel-held territory fear reprisals if the government retakes those areas. With their fate a growing political issue, many Syrians may still feel unease even if Erdogan beats Kilicdaroglu on Sunday, noting his administration's plans for new housing projects across the border to accelerate their eventual repatriation. Like other regional leaders, Erdogan is also mending fences with Assad,  raising the possibility of a rapprochement that could worry many Syrians in Turkiye. Saad Abdalkader, who has lived in Turkiye since 2015, said he could envisage no stability in Syria while Assad held power, and was considering travelling onwards to Europe in search of safety. He recounted an incident when a friend was robbed, but feared he would be assaulted if he went to the police to illustrate the precarious position many Syrians feel themselves to be in Turkiye. Omar Kadkoy, a Syrian working at the Ankara-based economic think tank, TEPAV, said Syrians still faced ""misery and fear"" in their home country, which would feel like a foreign land to their children. ""It isn't an easy decision to make,"" he said of returning voluntarily, adding that for Syrian children in Turkiye: ""They're moulded by everything that is Turkish. To them, Syria is a bed-time story.""

Sudan war spells more disaster for Darfur city on Chad border,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 3:34 pm",Africa+News+Sudan,"When war engulfed Sudan's capital last month, it quickly spread to the western Darfur region, reigniting an old conflict and sending a wave of refugees over the border into Chad, Reuters reports. Nasr Abdullahi sent his wife, sister and five children to Chad last week, staying behind to wait for news of a 17-year-old son in the capital, Khartoum. But when his neighbour's house was burned down and gangs took over the streets, he fled, too. ""I couldn't take it anymore, so I decided to leave on foot,"" the 42-year-old said, after arriving exhausted on Wednesday in the Chadian town of Adre, about 27km (17 miles) from El Geneina, the main city in West Darfur State. ""I crossed through the bush and walked west all night."" Residents link the resurgence of violence in El Geneina and other parts of Darfur to the power struggle between Sudan's Army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Khartoum, which has allowed militias in the area to go unchecked. Those interviewed by Reuters said the attacks since late April in El Geneina were carried out by Janjaweed militias, armed men usually thought to come from Arab nomadic tribes riding trucks, motorcycles and horses – the same militias from which the RSF was born. READ: 18 civilians killed in clashes in Sudan's Darfur: Medics The RSF denies instigating violence in Darfur, instead blaming the Army. The attacks in El Geneina have razed its markets, power grid and medical facilities, witnesses say, reviving memories of the atrocious violence that erupted in the early 2000s. Sudan's Health Ministry says up to 510 people have been killed in the city of about half a million. At least 250,000 people in West Darfur have been internally displaced, while another 90,000 have fled to Chad. With El Geneina's communications now cut off, Abdullahi's account offered a rare glimpse of the chaos. ""Heavy weapons and machine guns are being fired everywhere. When you go out in the morning, you see new bullet holes in the walls,"" he said, adding that water supplies were cut and food was running scarce in the city he left. The feared Janjaweed militias first gained power as the government used them against rebels in Darfur two decades ago. More than 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million displaced. The RSF emerged from them and grew into a large paramilitary force with legal status. Its commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, became deputy head of Sudan's ruling council after helping topple former leader Omar al-Bashir during a popular uprising in 2019. Though conflict in Darfur is often described along ethnic lines, pitting Arab tribes against non-Arabs, it is also rooted in a struggle for land, intensified by climate change. ""This is between the herder and the farmer. It's about resources and land,"" said Sultan Saad Bahreldin, leader of the Masalit tribe, the largest bloc of El Geneina residents. Arab livestock herders migrated to less arid areas during droughts in Darfur in the 1970s and 80s, causing tensions, said Jerome Tubiana, a researcher on the region. They gained more land as the Janjaweed helped government forces drive back rebels in the conflict from 2003. But they felt a 2020 peace deal with some rebel groups, which promised the return of displaced people to their land, ignored their needs. Attacks increased as international peacekeepers withdrew. READ: 85,000 people forced into secondary displacement in Geneina, Sudan: OCHA Five El Geneina residents, most preferring to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation, said by telephone – before lines went down – that they thought the militias aimed to empty the city and that the army had done little to offer protection. Instead, armed Masalit men and members of the Sudanese Alliance, a group that signed the peace deal, fight from within the neighbourhoods they live in. ""The militias attacked anyone present in the city, even if they initially targeted Masalit tribes. Even Arab residents were not safe,"" said Mohamed Aldouma, former governor of the state and member of the Darfur Bar Association, a human rights group. Lawyer, Jamal Abdallah, said that witnesses had told him of one incident in El Geneina where seven people were killed in one home, and another in a makeshift clinic where 12 already injured people and a doctor were gunned down. ""The Janjaweed come into homes and shoot,"" Abdallah added, saying he could see dead bodies and dead animals strewn in the street. Three people living in El Geneina told Reuters that they saw attackers wearing the RSF's beige uniforms. The RSF has, in the past, rebuked individual soldiers for involvement in Janjaweed attacks, but it accuses the Army and allied militias of being behind the latest Darfur violence. Hemedti, who hails from an Arab tribe, called on people in El Geneina in an audio message earlier this week to ""reject regionalism and tribalism. Stop fighting amongst yourselves immediately."" READ: Sudan fighting threatens $50bn Gulf investments An Army spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the Janjaweed militias could not be reached. Attempts to contact leaders of Arab tribes living in the city failed due to the blackout. Enaam Alnour, a local activist, said her brother and several male relatives were killed and her neighbourhood was ""completely destroyed, burned, looted"". She told Reuters from El Geneina that she documented from doctors and witnesses the rape of nine female university students by armed men. Reuters could not verify those incidents. The Sudanese Doctors Union said that all of the city's hospitals were destroyed, as well as its blood bank. Photos shared by a local journalist with Reuters showed drip bottles punctured, rendering them useless. Government buildings, the main market and aid agency offices were looted, witnesses and aid groups said. Though West Darfur is the nation's hungriest state, many farmers are unable to access land or supplies to prepare for the rainy season. At least 85,000 people who had sought refuge after previous attacks inside El Geneina's now-destroyed schools, municipal buildings and mosques are displaced again, said Mathilde Vu, of the Norwegian Refugee Council. It is dangerous for aid workers to deploy, Vu said. ""We are looking at a very bleak future.""

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

Iraq: Kurdish region loses $1.5bn since oil exports to Turkiye stopped,Unknown,"May 24, 2023 at 11:47 am",Asia & Americas+Europe & Russia+Iraq+Kurdistan+Middle East+News+Turkey+US,"The Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq has lost more than $1.5 billion since oil exports to Turkiye were stopped, according to a report published on Tuesday by the US financial website Zero Hedge. Oil production in the region under KRG rule has continued to decline, extending a stoppage that has lasted nearly two months. Export flows to Ceyhan port in Turkiye show few signs of resuming after Ankara halted Iraq's 450,000 barrels per day exported through the Iraq-Turkiye pipeline on 25 March. The flow was stopped after the ICC ruled that Turkiye should pay Baghdad $1.5bn in damages for unauthorised exports. ""The stoppage is estimated to have cost the KRG more than $1.5bn,"" said Zero Hedge. ""Fields that had continued producing are now offline or operating with reduced output."" About ten days ago, the Iraqi State Organisation for Marketing of Oil (SOMO) notified the Turkish state energy company, Petroleum Pipeline Corporation, which owns the pipelines, that export and loading operations will be resumed. The Iraqi federal government and the Kurdish regional government signed an agreement last month to resume Kurdish oil exports via Turkiye, but Turkiye continued to stop the flow, saying that it wants to negotiate the arbitration before any resumption of exports from Iraq. Iraq's economy relies heavily on crude oil exports, which make up over 90 per cent of the country's revenues. READ: Kurdish oil exports stay halted as Iraq negotiates with Turkiye The delay in resuming exports comes at a time when the French multinational oil and gas company TotalEnergies has finally reached an agreement with the government of Iraq to start a long-delayed energy project worth an estimated $27bn. The two parties first agreed the deal in 2021, which will see Total building four oil, gas and renewable energy projects in southern Iraq over a period of 25 years, with initial investments of $10bn. However, the giant project was postponed amid disagreements and bickering between Iraqi politicians over the terms of the deal. Last month, though, Iraq agreed to a smaller 30 per cent stake in the project, kickstarting a project that could attract foreign investment back into the country.

Jerusalem: elderly Palestinian couple 'cannot imagine' forced eviction from home,Unknown,"May 24, 2023 at 11:44 am",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"An elderly Palestinian couple living in the Old City of Jerusalem have said that they cannot imagine the moment when they will be forcibly evicted by illegal Jewish settlers backed by Israeli occupation forces. ""It's like waiting for death,"" Nora Ghaith, 68, and Mustafa Sub-Laban, 72, told journalists who asked about their plans regarding the deadline for living in their home in Aqbat Al-Khalidiya neighbourhood. An Israeli enforcement officer delivered a notice of forced eviction to the couple on 11 May. The date set for their displacement is Sunday, 11 June. They have lived in their home since before Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967. It is going to be taken over by a Jewish settler organisation. More demolitions – Cartoon [Sabaaneh/MiddleEastMonitor]The family home was leased from Jordan in 1953 and has been the subject of a protected lease since then. Like many other homes in the neighbourhood, it is a target for the settler organisations. After more than 45 years of repeated lawsuits and harassment against the family by the occupation authorities and, since 2010, by the Galicia settler association, the Israeli courts decided to end the family's protected lease and throw them out.
The Galicia settler association claims that the home of the Palestinian family in what is now part of a residential compound seized by settlers, is a Jewish endowment property. The courts evicted the rest of the family in 2016 and prevented the couple's children and grandchildren from living with them.
The family's failure to abide by the eviction order and leave their home voluntarily before the above-mentioned date means that the Israeli settlers, backed by the occupation government and armed forces, will forcibly evict the elderly couple. At the same time, the couple will be forced to pay the high costs of the eviction, as well as the costs of taking their property out of their home.
The UN Human Rights Office in the Occupied Palestinian Territories said that it was deeply concerned by the imminent forced eviction of the family scheduled for 11 June.
READ: Israel advances plan for 'apartheid' road
""The forced eviction of the Sub-Laban family is part of ongoing evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem, primarily based on discriminatory laws and practices, which violate the human rights of Palestinians, resulting in forced evictions, the loss of property and sources of livelihood,"" said the UN. ""Forced evictions are a key factor in creating a coercive environment that may lead to forcible transfer, which is prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to a war crime.""
The UN called on Israel ""to immediately halt all forced evictions, including that of the Ghaith/Sub-Laban family and to cease any activity that would further contribute to a coercive environment and lead to a risk of forcible transfer.""

Palestine Action pair sent to prison for dismantling weapons factory,Unknown,"May 24, 2023 at 10:30 am",Afghanistan+Asia & Americas+Europe & Russia+Iraq+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+UK+Videos & Photo Stories,"Two people who took direct action to dismantle and occupy a weapons factory were given prison sentences on Tuesday after pleading guilty to charges of criminal damage. A third person who took part in the action was acquitted at Chester Crown Court. Scientist Mike Lynch-White was sentenced to 27 months in prison. The other was sentenced to 16 months. Half of a custodial sentence is normally served in prison. Lynch-White was on remand for three months prior to the sentencing for taking direct action with the climate group Burning Pink, and may face a further custodial sentence for his involvement in the group Heathrow Pause. The three occupied the APPH site in June 2021 as part of a wider campaign to immobilise Israel's military supply chain in Britain. APPH is a supplier of drone landing gear to Elbit Systems, specifically to its Leicester-based subsidiary UAV Tactical Systems, a company known to export drones regularly and directly to Israel. APPH supplies landing gear for UAV Tactical System's Watchkeeper drone project. The Watchkeeper is a British drone which has been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and is based upon Israel's Hermes drone, also produced by Elbit. The Hermes is a staple for the Israeli military, and is advertised and sold as ""battle-tested"" having been used against the captive Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. APPH also produces the landing gear for BAE Systems' Hawkjet, used by Saudi Arabia in its attacks on Yemen, as well as a number of other fighter jets and military helicopters. ""I have seen how the Palestinian people are at best second-class citizens in their own ever-shrinking land,"" said Mike Lynch-White. ""Clearly, this is apartheid. We have denounced and defeated it before and we must do so again. This is not complicated: stand with the defenceless, not the powerful."" READ: Netherlands signs $305m deal for arms from Israel's Elbit Systems According to a spokesperson for Palestine Action, ""The prison sentences demonstrate the state's desperation to protect Israel's military supply chain, over the lives of Palestinians and the liberty of activists in Britain. Both acted to disrupt the military industrial complex which profits from the blood of the Palestinian people and the apartheid regime by which they are subjugated. For this, they should be rewarded, not imprisoned."" Despite the continued attempts at intimidation to deter actions against Israel's arms trade, the spokesperson added, the movement grows day by day. Palestine Action is a direct-action network of groups and individuals formed with the mandate of acting against the sites of Elbit Systems and other companies complicit in Israeli apartheid.

According to Israeli media, the UAE Ambassador to Israel, Mohammad Al-Khaja, handed a letter to Netanyahu from Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan officially inviting him to participate in the conference along with other world leaders. The letter conveyed the greetings of Bin Zayed and Vice President Mohammed Bin Rashid, the ruler of Dubai, along with their wishes for progress, peace and prosperity for Israel and its people. Last month, the UAE said that Bin Zayed received a phone call from Netanyahu discussing mutual relations and ways to reinforce them. However, Netanyahu claimed that Bin Zayed initiated the call to congratulate him and the Israelis on the Jewish Passover festival.

Bahrain abolishes law pardoning rapists who marry victims,Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 9:00 pm",Africa+Bahrain+International Organisations+Jordan+Lebanon+Middle East+News+Tunisia+UN,"Bahrain's Parliament has voted to abolish a law that exempts rapists from punishment if they marry their victims, joining other countries in the region in reforming such legislation. Under Article 353 of Bahrain's penal code, those who committed rape or sexual assault were able to avoid punishment if they married their victim. This week, however, Bahrain's Shura Council – its Upper House of Parliament – unanimously voted to remove that law in a landmark reform in the country's legal system. During the weekly session of Parliament, Nawaf Al Maawada, Bahraini Minister of Justice, Islamic Affairs and Endowments, stated that ""rapists will not escape punishment. Bahrain is a country with a traditional Muslim culture with respect offered to many religions"". He added that ""Governments need to study and update legislation as society and cultures evolve."" The move makes Bahrain the latest country in the Middle East and North Africa region to abolish laws that have long controversially allowed rapists to avoid prosecution by simply pledging to marry their victims. It follows on from other such as Lebanon, Jordan and Tunisia which did away with similar laws back in 2017. READ: HRW: Bahrain police beat, threaten children with rape According to the Emirati news outlet, The National, the vote was welcomed by numerous Bahraini political figures and women's rights activists who had campaigned for years to scrap or amend the legislation. Nancy Khedouri – a Shura Council member and part of the foreign affairs, defence and national security committee which oversaw the bill to abolish the law – told the outlet that it ""came as an imperative necessity because it did not address the issue of rape and did not provide adequate protection for women from this crime but, on the contrary, it protected the rapist and rewarded him for his crime by marrying the victim, without taking into account her psychological status and the status of her family in society"". She added that ""It made those who are victims of the crime of rape in a worse situation than those who commit the crime, where a marriage resulting from a rape would allow a quick escape for the rapist from being lawfully penalised"". Khaled El Mekwad, the United Nations' resident co-ordinator in Bahrain, was also quoted as saying that ""this landmark legislative reform will increase the protection of the fundamental rights of women and girls in Bahrain.""

Lebanon set to be grey-listed by financial crime watchdog - sources,Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 8:17 pm",IMF+International Organisations+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon is likely to be placed on a ""grey list"" of countries under special scrutiny over unsatisfactory practices to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Being added to the list would be another major blow to a country in a financial tailspin since 2019 and struggling to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund. The local pound has lost more than 98 per cent of its value, plunging most of the population into poverty, and diplomats have been expressing concern for months that the increasingly cash-based economy could hide growing illicit flows of money. The Middle East and North Africa section of the Financial Action Task Force, a financial crime watchdog, has carried out a preliminary evaluation of Lebanon's economy, which the sources said it will share with member states this week in Bahrain. The cumulative score of that evaluation puts Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source, which had seen a copy of the preliminary report. According to a draft seen by Reuters, Lebanon was scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The FATF declined to comment on the report or the score ahead of its publication. ""Lebanon is pitching for more leniency, and trying to have an improved score on one of the categories so it is no longer within the grey-listing zone,"" the diplomatic source said. READ: Lebanon depositors smash up, burn Beirut banks Lebanon's deputy Prime Minister, Saade Chami, who is heading the country's talks with the IMF, told Reuters he had not seen the draft report and declined to comment on the impact it might have on talks with the lender of last resort. A financial source familiar with the matter said the draft gave Lebanon a score worthy of grey-listing. ""Authorities are trying very hard to stop that from happening,"" the source said. A second diplomatic source familiar with the matter said the draft document was already lenient, given the collapsing state of the Lebanese economy. ""Anything but grey-listing would be a scandal,"" the source said. Both diplomatic sources said that the compliance department at the Central Bank's special investigations commission was lobbying FATF member states in a bid to change the score. The compliance department did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Being put on the FATF grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly exiting relationships with customers based in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Such a listing also risks reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. In Lebanon's case, the financial meltdown has already severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. But the listing would represent an indictment of Lebanon's financial system at a painful time. The country has been slow to make progress on key reforms required for a deal with the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol red notice. South Africa was added to the FATF list in February and the United Arab Emirates was added in March 2022.

It comes amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis that the detention camps in north-east Syria have resulted in, as the relatives and children of deceased or captured fighters of the terror group, Daesh, continue to languish in the Kurdish militia-run camps of Al-Hol and Roj under deteriorating conditions. A vast majority of those detained are reportedly children under the age 12. Over 41,000 of the camps' detainees are foreign citizens, according to Human Rights Watch, and many nations – especially those in the West and Europe – continue to disregard calls by the United Nations and a variety of human rights groups to repatriate their citizens, claiming that they pose national security threats.

"Israel has demolished more buildings in occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, says UN",Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 4:00 pm",International Organisations+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+UN,"The Israeli occupation authorities have demolished 42 Palestinian-owned buildings in occupied Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, including 17 homes, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has said in its latest report. The latest demolitions took place within the first two weeks of this month. At least 50 Palestinians were displaced by the demolitions, including 23 children. The livelihoods of more than 600 others were affected, said OCHA. Moreover, nine of the buildings were provided by donors as part of humanitarian aid, including a school. They were demolished on the grounds that they lacked construction and renovation permits issued by the occupation authorities, the report revealed. Such building licences are notoriously difficult and very expensive for Palestinians to obtain, and are in any case rarely issued. With growing families, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem must either extend their homes or build new ones without licences. More demolitions – Cartoon [Sabaaneh/MiddleEastMonitor]Most of the demolitions were targeted in Area C, which is under full Israeli military control, including the donor-funded school in Bethlehem. The school had five classrooms and more than sixty pupils between the first and fourth grades.
The remaining demolitions, according to the report, took place in occupied East Jerusalem, which resulted in the displacement of seven families with 39 members, including 22 children.
Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 Six Day War. It annexed the entire city in 1980, in a move never recognised by the international community.
In addition to the demolitions, the report said that from the beginning of this year until 15 May, Israeli forces killed 108 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. This was more than double the death toll of 51 in the same period last year.
WATCH: Israel bombs home of martyr Moataz Khawaja in the town of Ni'lin
The report also called out Israel for its punitive measures against the relatives of those accused of committing crimes. ""Punitive demolitions are a form of collective punishment and are illegal under international law, because they target the families of the perpetrators of the attacks or the alleged attacks,"" explained OCHA.
Under international law, both the West Bank and East Jerusalem are occupied territories. All settlement building for Israeli Jewish settlers is, therefore, illegal.

Top Israel General says 'action' is on horizon over Iran nuclear work,Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 3:26 pm",Iran+Israel+Middle East+News,"The top Israeli General raised the prospect of ""action"" against Iran on Tuesday even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's National Security Adviser played down any immediate threat posed by a new underground nuclear facility being dug by Tehran, Reuters reports. World powers' efforts to negotiate new curbs to Iranian uranium enrichment and other projects with bomb-making potential have been fruitless, so far, fanning long-bruited threats by Israel to resort to force if it deems diplomacy a dead end. ""Iran has advanced with uranium enrichment further than ever before … There are negative developments on the horizon that could bring about (military) action,"" Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, chief of Israel's Armed Forces, said in a speech. He did not detail what those developments might be, nor what action might be taken and by whom. ""We have capabilities, and others also have capabilities,"" Halevi told the Herzliya Conference, an international security forum, in an apparent allusion to Israel's US ally. Experts are divided over whether the Israeli military has the clout to deal lasting damage to Iranian nuclear facilities that are distant, dispersed and defended. Iran denies seeking the bomb and has vowed devastating reprisals for any attack. READ: Israel disappointed over the growing Arab-Iranian cooperation There has been speculation Israel might use countries on Iran's borders as springboards for strikes. One such country, Azerbaijan, dismissed that idea, despite its strong Israel ties. ""We refrain from interfering in the disputes or problems (of other countries), including by allowing or giving our territory for some operations or adventures,"" Deputy Azeri Foreign Minister, Fariz Rzayev, said at the conference. The Associated Press on Monday reported Iran was building a new underground site in the Zagros Mountains to replace an exposed uranium centrifuge manufacturing centre at nearby Natanz that was struck by an explosion and fire in July 2020. ""This, of course, limits the capacity to carry out an attack, relative to above-ground facilities, which is of course easier. But what can be said about this matter is that there is nowhere that cannot be reached,"" Israeli National Security Adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, told the conference. Following the 2020 incident, Iran announced in 2021 that it was working to move some of its centrifuge manufacturing halls into the ""heart of the mountain near Natanz"", an area where Iranian engineers have long carried out excavation work. Hanegbi declined to threaten an explicit Israeli attack and even suggested the onus would be on the United States by noting that it has massive GBU-43/B bombs which are not in Israel's arsenal. In any event, Hanegbi added, ""this (underground facility near Natanz) is years away from being completed"". Though Washington prefers to pursue diplomacy with Iran, the allies see ""eye to eye"" and have no significant difference on potential ""red lines"" for last-resort military action, he said.

Iran builds underground nuclear facility in defiance of Western sanctions,Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 3:25 pm",Asia & Americas+Iran+Middle East+News+US,"Iran is building a new underground nuclear facility in defiance of Western sanctions, as talks aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers remain stalled. According to Associated Press, the facility is being built so deep in the earth that it is likely to be beyond the range of the latest US ""bunker buster"" weapon designed to destroy such sites. AP cited experts and satellite imagery in its analysis. Photos and videos from Planet Labs PBC show that Iran has been digging tunnels in the mountain near the Natanz nuclear site, which has faced repeated sabotage amid Tehran's standoff with the West over its atomic programme. ""With Iran now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers, the installation complicates the West's efforts to halt Tehran from potentially developing an atomic bomb as diplomacy over its nuclear program remains stalled,"" said AP. READ: Russia and Iran sign rail deal for corridor intended to rival Suez Canal Completion of the facility ""would constitute a nightmare scenario that risks igniting a new escalatory spiral,"" warned Kelsey Davenport, the director of non-proliferation policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. ""Given how close Iran is to a bomb, it has very little room to ratchet up its programme without tripping US and Israeli red lines. So, at this point, any further escalation increases the risk of conflict."" The construction at Natanz comes five years after former US President Donald Trump withdrew America unilaterally from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal.

"US, EU lawmakers push to depose UAE Jaber from climate talks",Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 3:23 pm",Asia & Americas+COP28+EU+International Organisations+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"Over 100 members of the US Congress and European Parliament called on Tuesday for Sultan Al-Jaber to be removed as the designated head of the upcoming COP28 climate talks, saying the oil executive's appointment threatened the integrity of negotiations, Reuters reports. Jaber, who heads the United Arab Emirates oil giant, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, was chosen in January to lead the talks. He also serves as the UAE's Ministry of Industry and Technology as well as its Climate Envoy. In a letter sent to US President Joe Biden, European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen and the United Nations, the lawmakers voiced ""profound concern"" that private sector polluters would be able to ""exert undue influence"" on the climate negotiations, to be held in Dubai later this year. ""We urge you to … engage in diplomatic efforts to secure the withdrawal of the President-designate of COP28,"" they wrote. Signatories included US Democratic senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Most EU signatories hailed from the Greens and Left groups. Scientists and climate activists have expressed dismay at Jaber's appointment, taking it as a sign that big industry has commandeered the global response to the climate crisis. READ: UAE names head of oil company as COP28 climate conference president More than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists were present at the COP27 climate talks held in Egypt last year. This is not the first time that lawmakers have called for Jaber's removal. Shortly after his appointment, 27 Democratic members of the US Congress sent a letter to top US Climate Envoy, John Kerry, urging him to persuade the future UN climate summit host to withdraw its pick of Jaber. Responding to criticism, Jaber previously told Reuters that he had ""no intention"" of deviating from the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""Keeping 1.5 alive is a top priority and it will cut across everything I do,"" he said. Others have thrown their support behind the oil executive. On Monday, EU Climate Policy chief, Frans Timmermans told a European Parliament meeting that ""if we want the energy transition to succeed, we have to get the energy companies on board."" ""Vilifying them and ignoring them is not going to get the dynamics going in terms of the energy transition, and Dr. Sultan Al Jaber has also a long track record of investing in renewables within his company,"" Timmermans said.

Taha was speaking at the 39th meeting of the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the OIC (COMCEC), which kicked off in the Turkish capital, Ankara. The official also conveyed his condolences to the victims of the 6 February twin earthquakes centred in Turkiye's southern Kahramanmaras province. Stating that COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying measures caused an unprecedented slowdown in economic activities on a global scale, Taha said: ""In mid-2022, the world started to take the pandemic under control. However, global economic growth weakened due to the Ukraine-Russia war and the subsequent sanctions.""

According to the estimates of the World Bank, the crisis will push 75-95 million extra people to live in extreme poverty, Taha said. ""We are making efforts to support economic recovery and increase economic cooperation among our member countries. We hold many meetings for this.

France officials will not meet with Israel's far-right finance minister Smotrich,Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 2:28 pm",Europe & Russia+France+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+Videos & Photo Stories,"Extremist Israeli Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, will struggle to arrange meetings with senior French officials during his planned visit to Paris next month, Israeli media has warned, saying this is a result of his denial of the existence of the Palestinian people during his visit to Paris two months ago. Smotrich is expected to visit Paris to attend the Finance Ministers conference of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. However, his office has been unable to arrange additional meetings for him, whether with his French counterpart or with any of the senior officials in the Paris municipality. The annual meeting of the Finance Ministers of the OECD countries will be held at its headquarters in Paris on 7-8 June, with the participation of 38 developed countries that collectively represent 60 per cent of the global gross domestic product. The Israeli occupation state became an OECD member in 2010. Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported: ""This French boycott comes after reactions caused by a private visit by Smotrich to Paris two months ago … A map of the 'Greater Israel', which includes Jordanian territory, was displayed on his platform. In his speech, he declared that 'there is no such thing named a Palestinian people, and this truth must be heard in the Élysée Palace and the White House'. The official French response was not delayed, as the Foreign Ministry has described his words as 'outrageous and irresponsible and the expanded map of Israel as 'provocative'."" It continued, ""Only a week later, official French sources explained that France is avoiding holding meetings with ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. On 9 May, representatives of the European Union (EU) cancelled the official celebration of 'Europe Day' in Israel after the selection of Ben-Gvir to represent his government in it, and the EU embassy in Tel Aviv announced that we are not interested in providing any platform for those whose positions conflict with EU values.""

"Israel 'embarrassed' UAE, so no other Arab state will normalise ties",Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 2:23 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+UAE,"After the UAE was ""embarrassed"" by Israel, no further Arab state is likely to normalise relations with Tel Aviv, a senior Emirati policy analyst is reported as saying at the Herzliya Conference at Israel's Reichman University. ""The latest government in Israel will not kill the Abraham Accords, the signatories will not pull out, but we will not have other signatories,"" said Dr Ebtesam Al-Ketbi, the founder and president of the Emirates Policy Centre. ""We were looking to engage more from the Arab world and the non-Arab world… [but] the latest government is putting everybody off."" Haaretz reported that Al-Ketbi continued by commenting on the humiliation inflicted on the UAE by Israel. ""My government and the other signatories are embarrassed in front of the Arab people, and they have to say something. And they want a solution for that because they invested heavily in the Abraham Accords. It's a big loss for Israel when the Saudis side with Iran."" OPINION: Normalisation has included the deliberate humiliation of the UAE It's not clear which disagreement between the UAE and Israel Al-Ketbi was referring to as the source of Abu Dhabi's embarrassment. Since it normalised relations with the apartheid state in 2020, Israel has continued to entrench its illegal occupation of Palestine and gone on to elect the most far-right government in its history of far-right governments. Preventing Israel from annexing the West Bank was one of the reasons cited by the UAE to justify its decision to normalise ties with Israel. Instead of pausing annexation, though, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has handed control of the occupied West Bank to extreme far-right members of his coalition. The desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has also become a source of frustration. In the lead up to last November's Israeli election, UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed expressed concern about the growing influence of Ben-Gvir, who was seen brandishing a gun and threatening to shoot Palestinians. The UAE has issued repeated condemnations since then of the provocations by Israeli ministers. Relations soured in January when Netanyahu postponed his visit to Abu Dhabi following anger over the desecration of Al-Aqsa by members of his coalition. In the three years since the signing of the Abraham Accords, public support for normalising ties with Israel has declined sharply in the Gulf. When first polled in 2020, attitudes in the UAE and Bahrain, which also has normalised relations with Israel, were effectively split as to whether they saw the agreement in a positive or negative light. Two years later, the percentage of those who see the agreement in a positive light is said to hover between 19 per cent to 25 per cent in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE. The poll was conducted before Israel elected its most extreme far-right government in history. Netanyahu rewarded Ben-Gvir, a disciple of the Israeli terrorist who massacred 29 Palestinians at Al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in 1994, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, another extremist who incited terrorism against Palestinians by calling for them to be ""wiped out"", with senior positions in his cabinet. The decision by Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore ties following China-brokered talks is seen as a sign that the Abraham Accords have run out of steam.

Saudi Arabia concludes deals to build world's largest green hydrogen plant,Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 1:31 pm",Middle East+News+Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia's Neom Green Hydrogen Company has concluded a series of agreements with 23 local, regional and international banks and investment companies, worth $8.4 billion to establish the world's largest green hydrogen production plant. The company said, in a statement issued Monday, that the plant, with equal joint venture between Acwa Power, Air Products and Neom, will be built in the city of Oxagon within the NEOM region in the west of the Kingdom. According to the statement, Air Products will be responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction works, while NEOM has been approved by the American Standard & Poor's Global credit rating agency, as an ""adhering to green loan principles"". According to the statement, the hydrogen plant will produce up to 4 gigawatts of solar and wind energy which will, in turn, be used to produce up to 600 metric tons per day of carbon-free hydrogen by the end of 2026. NEOM is Saudi Arabia's ""most ambitious"" projects and one of dozens of real estate ventures created to advance social and economic reforms in the Kingdom. OPINION: Four special projects in the MENA region leading the way to NET ZERO 2050 The Kingdom plans to be the largest source of hydrogen in the world, according to a previous statement by Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. The technology for large-scale green hydrogen production remains uncertain, but the market is expected to be worth $700 billion annually by 2050, according to Bloomberg estimates. Riyadh also plans to reach net zero emissions by 2060, by developing carbon capture plants and storage centres. Riyadh, a leading oil producer and a key member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), believes demand for oil will remain high for decades, and is spending billions of dollars to increase its production crude capacity, but Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, aims to diversify the economy and rely on hydrogen as part of his Vision 2030 strategy.

Iran-UAE dispute over Persian Gulf islands lingers amid regional diplomacy drive,Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 1:28 pm",Iran+Middle East+News+UAE,"Despite the wave of diplomacy sweeping the region with the rapprochement between Iran and some of its neighbouring countries, the dark clouds of a long-running territorial dispute between Tehran and Abu Dhabi over three Persian Gulf islands continue to hover overhead, Anadolu News Agency reports. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, in a strongly-worded statement Saturday, a day after the Arab League summit in the Saudi city of Jeddah, decried the joint communiqué issued at the summit, referring to ""accusations and false claims"" in it. While ""welcoming the constructive approach of some countries"", Kanaani hit out at the 22-member pan-Arab organisation for making ""repetitive claims"" asserting that Iran's actions ""are in line with the exercise of sovereignty over its territory, and any claim in this regard is rejected"". Although he stopped short of mentioning the three strategic islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa located in the Strait of Hormuz, the hint was clear enough. The three islands have been administered by Iran since 1971, eight years before the Iranian Revolution, but are claimed by the United Arab Emirates as part of its territory. The territorial dispute has been a key sticking point in Iran-UAE relations over the years, with the two neighbours on numerous occasions engaging in verbal duels at international forums. While Iran maintains that the islands are an ""inseparable part"" of its territory, the UAE lays equal claim to them, backed by other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members. Yaseen Taqizadeh, a Persian Gulf affairs analyst, said the dispute dates back more than five decades and the recent upgrading of ties between Tehran and Abu Dhabi is unlikely to resolve the issue. ""The dispute over the sovereignty of three islands is rooted in history, with both sides making competing claims,"" he told Anadolu. ""It will continue to be a bone of contention between them, regardless of recent developments unless they agree to engage in meaningful dialogue."" In February, President Ebrahim Raisi's visit to Beijing, the first by an Iranian head of state in two decades, was overshadowed by a controversy related to the joint statement issued by China and the GCC during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Saudi Arabia in December. The statement backed the UAE's demand for the ""resolution of the dispute"" over the three Persian Gulf islands, sparking an outcry in Iran and almost creating a diplomatic row between Tehran and Beijing. Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian took to Twitter and asserted that Tehran ""will not allow any country to disrespect its territorial integrity."" The veiled warning in the Chinese language was directed at Beijing. Raisi's key aide and deputy Chief of Staff, Mohammad Jamshidi, was particularly blunt, issuing what he called ""a reminder to colleagues in Beijing"". His statement came after the Chinese ambassador to Iran was summoned to convey Tehran's ""strong dissatisfaction"". READ: Iran summons Chinese envoy for statement on disputed islands ""Raisi's visit to Beijing, although planned in advance, was an exercise in controlling the damage from the China-GCC statement, and it eventually did more than many had expected – laying the groundwork for Iran's reconciliation with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states,"" said Taqizadeh. Weeks after the Iranian President's China visit, Iran's then-top security official, Ali Shamkhani, dashed off to Beijing in March to sign an agreement with his Saudi Arabian counterpart to restore diplomatic ties between the two regional rivals. China played the peacemaker. Shamkhani's next stop, interestingly, was Abu Dhabi, where he held wide-ranging talks with top Emirati officials, including his counterpart, Tahnoun bin Zayed. The two sides agreed to ""resolve misunderstandings"" and ""expand relations to the highest level"". It is not known, however, whether the dispute over the three Persian Gulf islands featured in discussions between the two sides. ""It's highly likely that the dispute over the three islands figured in Shamkhani's discussions with Emirati officials,"" said Milad Hatam, a researcher with a focus on Middle East affairs. Shamkhani stepped down, Monday, from his position as Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council after 10 years and was replaced by an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander. The UAE and Iran restored diplomatic ties in August last year, which the Emirati Foreign Ministry, in a statement at the time, said was ""to achieve the common interests of the two countries and the wider region"". The rapprochement came six years after Abu Dhabi recalled its ambassador to Tehran in solidarity with Riyadh after the Saudi Arabian Embassy in the Iranian capital was stormed by an angry mob in January 2016, following the execution of Saudi Shia cleric, Sheikh Nimr Al-Nimr. The UAE returned its envoy to Tehran in August last year and Iran appointed its ambassador to Abu Dhabi last month, with both sides expressing a commitment to upgrade ties. After Iran appointed its ambassador to the Arab country in April, the top diplomats of the two countries spoke over the phone and described bilateral relations as ""forward-looking"". ""There is no denying that relations between Iran and the UAE have improved since last year, with regular communication between the two sides at various levels, but the resolution of the dispute over the three islands holds the key,"" said Hatam. The status quo, he said, means they will continue to engage in verbal duels in international forums, like in September 2021, when they traded barbs at the 76th session of the UN General Assembly. At the time, the Emirati deputy Foreign Minister staked claim to the islands and called on Iran to end its ""occupation"", to which the Iranian mission in the UN responded by saying that the islands were an ""inseparable"" part of Iran's territory. ""I think it's very much possible for the two sides to settle the dispute through meaningful dialogue since the window of communication remains open between them,"" said Taqizadeh.

Reporters Without Borders calls for Egypt to release Tawfik Ghanem,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 10:37 am",Africa+Egypt+International Organisations+News+Reporters Without Borders (RSF)+UN,"Reporters Without Borders has called on the Egyptian authorities to release Tawfik Ghanem, the former bureau chief of the Anadolu Agency office in Cairo, noting that he had begun his third year in detention without being brought to trial. The organisation stated on its website, signed by the head of its Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, that imprisonment without trial is a common practice in Egypt, where 12 of the 20 imprisoned journalists are being held in pre-trial detention. The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt."" Ghanem has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years, as his provisional detention has been renewed every 15 to 45 days since 26 May, 2021. READ: UN: Malnutrition risk for half a million Yemen children Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Egyptian code of criminal procedure has a two-year limit on pre-trial detention, regardless of the charges. However, Ghanem is still being detained and deprived of medical care. He is 69 years old and suffers from serious health problems, including being diabetic. The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours. The authorities promised to do this but never fulfilled their promise. ""The Egyptian authorities must stop using provisional detention as a punitive tool against journalists. Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

Wafaa Mustafa Hajjaj, a Syrian citizen who lives with her child and nephews in Azaz in the countryside of Aleppo, told Anadolu that she came to Turkiye for treatment after she lost her eyesight in an attack on her village. Hajjaj, who stayed in Turkiye for five years, pointed out that during each stay, Turkish people have always supported her and her family. Hajjaj noted that she voluntarily returned to Syria. An infographic titled ""Falling number of Syrians refugees going home from Jordan, Lebanon"" is created in Ankara, Turkiye on October 25, 2022 [Yılmaz Yücel/Anadolu Agency]0The Syrian citizen hailed the Turkish effort in preparing the infrastructure for the Syrian refugees' return.
""The camp where we reside has water and electricity, and the needs are met through solar energy,"" Hajjaj told Anadolu.
She stressed the safety of the area she currently resides, adding: ""I believe that the rest of the Syrian refugees will return to their homeland whenever security prevails.""
""These areas are now safe because of Turkiye's presence,"" she added.
Turkish Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu, on Wednesday attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the project, ""Voluntary, Safe, Honourable Return Project"" in the northern Syria district of Jarablus, where he said a total of 240,000 houses will be constructed at nine separate locations across the Idlib and Afrin regions in the next three years.
Since 2016, Turkiye has launched four successful anti-terror operations across its border in northern Syria to prevent the formation of a terror corridor and enable peaceful settlement by locals: Euphrates Shield (2016), Olive Branch (2018), Peace Spring (2019) and Spring Shield (2020).
Thanks to these operations, the pace of the return of Syrian refugees from Turkiye to their country has accelerated.
More than 3.7 million Syrians currently reside in Turkiye, making it the world's top refugee-hosting country.
Following the start of a civil war in Syria in 2011, Turkiye adopted an ""open-door"" policy for Syrians fleeing persecution and brutality.
Syria has been embroiled in a vicious civil war since early 2011, when the Bashar Al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and more than 10 million others displaced, according to UN estimates.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. It has made little progress on reforms required by the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol Red Notice.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

Women 'most important heroes' of Turkiye struggle to serve nation: President,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:26 pm",Europe & Russia+News+Turkey,"Turkiye has realised many projects about women to enhance their area of ​​freedom, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, Anadolu Agency reports. ""Over the course of our 40-year-long journey in politics, we have always walked shoulder to shoulder with our women … We have always overcome the obstacles raised before us and the attacks that even reached the point of targeting our lives with the support of women. ""Today, I would like to underline, once again, that women are the most important heroes of our struggle to serve our country and nation,"" Erdogan said at a meeting with women's societies in Istanbul. Turkiye has expanded the areas of freedom, employment and representation of women without any discrimination, he stressed. ""We have increased the rate of women completing at least one level of education from 70 per cent to 88 per cent. We have increased women in employment from 6 million to 10.5 million,"" Erdogan said. The President added that the efforts and labour of women contributed to Turkiye's progress in all areas from economy to trade, from rights and freedoms to agriculture, tourism, education and health. Erdogan also hailed Diyarbakir mothers who continue their sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye. ""I pay my respects to the mothers of Diyarbakir, who have been on the guard for months to take back their children that the separatist organisation forcibly smuggled into the mountains,"" he said. He added that the mothers defy terrorist organisations through their watch for their children. The sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye began in September 2019 in Diyarbakir, when three mothers said their children had been forcibly recruited by YPG/PKK terrorists. The sit-in outside the offices of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) – a party currently facing a closure case, and which the government accuses of having links to the terrorist YPG/PKK – has been growing every day. Demonstrations have also spread to other provinces, including Van, Mus, Sirnak and Hakkari.

Israel mulls imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:14 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Israeli government is considering a bill aimed at imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, local media reported yesterday. According to media reports, the bill states that any nonprofit group that engages in public advocacy two years before or after receiving a donation from a foreign government will lose its status as a public institution and will no longer be eligible for tax exemptions. In addition, those non-profits will be hit with a 65 per cent income tax. The reports indicated that many organisations in Israel and the Palestinian territories depend on foreign funding, and the proposed bill could severely impact their ability to operate. The legislation, drafted by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, Ariel Kallner, is set to be brought before the Knesset's high-level Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday. Kallner said the goal of the tax is to ""prevent foreign interests from gaining the upper hand."" Kallner accused European countries of deliberately undermining Israel's interests through their financing activities.

Anger and fear among Syrians amid Turkiye opposition anti-immigrant campaign,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:08 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Like many Syrians in Turkiye, Ghaith Sameer is awaiting the result of Sunday's election runoff with trepidation, fearing a win for an opposition candidate who promises to swiftly repatriate migrants, Reuters reports. Sameer fled Syria's civil war in 2012 and is now one of over 3.4 million Syrians living in neighbouring Turkiye, where economic woes have aggravated a rising tide of hostility that has washed into the presidential election. ""The opposition's promises frighten me and make me angry, as well, because they make Turkish citizens hate us,"" said Sameer, who took Turkish nationality two years ago and plans to vote on Sunday for President Tayyip Erdogan. While Erdogan has a good chance to win the runoff after falling just short of an outright first-round victory two weeks ago, his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has embraced anti-migrant rhetoric to try to turn the race around. READ: The Syrians in Turkiye are between a rock and a hard place Kilicdaroglu has teamed up with a far-right nationalist party and promised to repatriate all migrants within a year, as posters bearing his face have sprouted across Turkish cities vowing that Syrians will leave. Although Erdogan has been more welcoming to Syrians and other migrants in Turkiye, which has the world's biggest refugee population of 5 million, he has also made moves to accelerate a return of migrants to Syria. For Syrians, the election and the anti-migrant turn in Turkish politics have cast new uncertainty over their future, causing many to wonder if they will have to start again, having already fled a deadly war in their homeland. Sameer, 38, said many of his friends and relatives were putting off plans until after the election when things would be clearer, with his brother even waiting to replace a broken food processor. ""Most Syrians now feel as if the course of their entire lives depends on the results of the elections,"" he lamented. Even though he has Turkish citizenship, Sameer has still been making alternative plans ""in case anything happens"". He has even considered moving with his wife and two small children to a country where conditions for Syrians might be better, such as Egypt or the Kurdish region of Iraq. When Kilicdaroglu announced a deal on Wednesday for far-right Victory Party leader, Umit Ozdag, to back him in the runoff, Ozdag said their promised departure of migrants would lift ""the burden"" on the economy and stop Turkiye becoming ""migrant-istan"". Playing on xenophobic stereotypes that accuse Syrians and Afghan refugees of theft, sexual harassment and other crimes, Ozdag said repatriating migrants would ""make the streets safe again"". Such language and Kilicdaroglu's new anti-migrant posters that hang from lamp posts and over underpasses have been particularly alarming for Syrians. ""Can anyone with even a shred of humanity accept to see signs hanging on the walls of schools and crowded streets threatening to deport Syrians?"" asked Ahmad, a 40-year-old Syrian who, like Sameer, now has Turkish nationality. READ: Is Turkiye democratic enough not to apply forced repatriation and politicising refugees? Ahmad, who withheld his family name fearing repercussions, said he was worried how the signs would affect Syrian children who can read Turkish because they are educated in the language, and described it as ""repulsive and disgusting hate speech"". Most major warfare has been paused in Syria for years, with Turkiye controlling enclaves across the border where it backs rebels against President Bashar Al-Assad and which are already crowded with displaced people from other parts of Syria. Life across the border is brutally hard, with damaged infrastructure, a ravaged economy and the constant threat that war could suddenly erupt again. People in rebel-held territory fear reprisals if the government retakes those areas. With their fate a growing political issue, many Syrians may still feel unease even if Erdogan beats Kilicdaroglu on Sunday, noting his administration's plans for new housing projects across the border to accelerate their eventual repatriation. Like other regional leaders, Erdogan is also mending fences with Assad,  raising the possibility of a rapprochement that could worry many Syrians in Turkiye. Saad Abdalkader, who has lived in Turkiye since 2015, said he could envisage no stability in Syria while Assad held power, and was considering travelling onwards to Europe in search of safety. He recounted an incident when a friend was robbed, but feared he would be assaulted if he went to the police to illustrate the precarious position many Syrians feel themselves to be in Turkiye. Omar Kadkoy, a Syrian working at the Ankara-based economic think tank, TEPAV, said Syrians still faced ""misery and fear"" in their home country, which would feel like a foreign land to their children. ""It isn't an easy decision to make,"" he said of returning voluntarily, adding that for Syrian children in Turkiye: ""They're moulded by everything that is Turkish. To them, Syria is a bed-time story.""

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

"Brazil´s president: The UN was so strong enough to create Israel, but now can't create a Palestinian state",Unknown,"April 28, 2023 at 11:43 am",Africa+Asia & Americas+Brazil+Egypt+Europe & Russia+France+Germany+India+International Organisations+Iraq+Israel+Japan+Libya+Middle East+News+Nigeria+Palestine+South Africa+Spain+UK+UN+US,"Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva this week slammed the UN's inability to create a Palestinian State in the same manner that it established the state of Israel in 1948. ""The UN was so strong that, in 1948, it managed to create the State of Israel. In 2023, it fails to create a Palestinian state,"" Lula said. Speaking during an official visit to Spain, Lula continued: ""We live in the world where the UN Security Council, the permanent members, they are the ones who sell the most weapons in the world, they are the biggest participants in wars in the world."" ""When the United States invaded Iraq, there was no discussion in the Security Council. When France and England invaded Libya and when Russia invaded Ukraine, there was no discussion either,"" he added. Astonished by the reduced role non-member states play in the international organisation, he asked the UN Security Council not to limit itself to its permanent members. ""I am therefore left wondering whether it is up to us, other countries that are not permanent [members] of the UN Security Council, to make a change. Why aren't Brazil, Spain, Japan, Germany, India, Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa [ permanent members]? The winners of the Second World War currently determine that, but the world has changed."" ""We need to build a new international mechanism that does things differently. I think it's time for us to start changing things and it's time for us to create a G20 of Peace, which should be the UN,"" he said. His calls were slammed by the pro-Israel group, StandWithUs Brasil, who said: ""Contrary to what the president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said, Israel was not created by the United Nations. In 1947, what the UN Partition advocated was the creation of two countries, one for Jews and the other for Arabs. The Jews accepted; the Arabs did not."" ""The State of Israel was founded after a war waged by the armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq against the Jews."" ""As for a State for Palestinians, neither the UN nor other international organisations currently have the role of creating it, unless Palestinians and Israelis themselves come to seal the peace independently,"" the statement added.

Israel discusses regional options to end challenge of Palestinian resistance in Gaza,Unknown,"May 23, 2023 at 1:00 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"Israel is clear that the resistance groups in the Gaza Strip pose an insurmountable military and security challenge. Discussions are now taking place in the occupation state about regional options to overcome this challenge, either by increasing the targeting of Iran or by asking Egypt to shoulder the burden that is growing heavier by the day. Knowing that the end of another offensive against Gaza means the beginning of preparations for the next one, there is not much that can be done. Gaza is a strategic problem for the occupation, even though it is not the most dangerous threat. ""Israel finds itself obliged to deal with all these challenges simultaneously, without giving equal attention to all of them, and certainly not to the less important issues, especially if they are not urgent,"" wrote Ehud Eilam, a military historian at Israel Defence magazine. ""The Gaza Strip, with all its escalating factors, is waiting, even if there is no other option. In this case, the most serious problem is Iran and its nuclear programme, knowing that dealing with Iran is linked to the Gaza Strip, as there are solutions for it, but they are all problematic."" Palestine, Israel: 75 years of massacres, abuse and displacement – Cartoon [Sabaaneh/Middle East Monitor]In his article translated by Arabi21, he added, ""Israel wants to replace the rule of Hamas in the Gaza Strip with another Palestinian party, or another Arab side that is more moderate, such as Egypt."" Egypt, he said, seems suitable for this position because it has borders with the Gaza Strip, ruled it previously, and the two people maintain close relations. ""Cairo also maintains its communications with the leaders of the factions in Gaza, but it is embroiled in its economic problems. The situation In Egypt has become extremely critical recently due to the war in Ukraine and rising poverty rates among its citizens, while it does not want to have responsibility for two million impoverished Palestinians in Gaza.""
Eilam pointed out that the Palestinian Authority barely governs the West Bank due to the difficulties and uncertainties regarding the post-Mahmoud Abbas era. ""There is an extremely small chance that the PA will be able to control Gaza, while Israel does not wish to occupy the Strip again… All of the problems that Gaza is experiencing make dealing with it from the outside better than inside.""
The search is on for a middle-ground solution for the future of Gaza, between radical re-occupation and the continuation of the status quo. ""The cost of destroying its military infrastructure will be high, especially if it lasts longer than planned, which is certainly possible,"" the historian concluded. While the possibility of greater Egyptian intervention in Gaza exposes the Israeli failure to cope with the escalating resistance, an Egyptian role is probably the only viable option for the occupation state to consider.

After a tour, researcher of Arab and Islamic Antiquities and Holy Sites in Palestine, Abdul Raziq Matani, reported a series of attacks on holy sites, including mosques in Palestinian villages which were emptied of their residents to make way for the creation of the state of Israel. The researcher said that mosques continue to fall and collapse, pointing out that Al-Ghabisiyya Mosque in Akka was recently vandalised. Matani noted that the mosque and archaeological monuments in the displaced village have been subjected to excavation, digging and destruction several times. ""The new violations and destruction in Al-Ghabisiyya Mosque included new excavation and digging of the floor of the mosque and damaging and extracting stones from different places, including the foundation stones of the minbar – pulpit, which was completely destroyed,"" he said. He pointed out that after the minbar was destroyed and its stones were stolen, the bottom of it was excavated, as was the floor near the outer mihrab, which was vandalised several months ago. Matani also documented a sharp increase in the cracks across the whole mosque, as well as in the tomb of Sheikh Samaan in the village of Kafr Saba.

Israel accuses Iran of using civilian ships as 'floating terror bases',Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 9:02 pm",Iran+Israel+Lebanon+Middle East+News+Palestine,"Israel accused the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Monday of turning commercial ships into platforms for launching missiles, drones and commandos, saying the objective was to spread Tehran's clandestine naval clout well beyond the Gulf, Reuters reports. The allegation by Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, came as tensions between the regional foes surge afresh over Iran's nuclear drive and support for Palestinian and Lebanese militias. Showing images of six purportedly repurposed Iranian vessels, five of them named, Gallant told the Herzliya Conference security forum that these were ""floating terror bases"" and that one had recently sailed toward the Gulf of Aden. ""This follows directly on the maritime terrorism Iran has been imposing on the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. It is working to expand its activity to the Indian Ocean, too, and later to the Red Sea and to the Mediterranean Sea, as well,"" Gallant said. There was no immediate response from Iran.

"Saudi Arabia, Israel in 'advanced contact' for direct Hajj travel",Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 9:01 pm",Bahrain+Israel+Jordan+Middle East+News+Palestine+Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia and Israel are continuing to cultivate ""advanced contact"" to facilitate direct flights to the Kingdom for Palestinians and Israeli Muslims intending to travel for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. According to the Israeli Channel 12, the two countries are holding discussions regarding the launch of direct flights between Tel Aviv and Saudi airports in order to enable Israel's Muslim citizens to perform the pilgrimage. Citing two Israeli officials, the Channel reported that Saudi Arabia was approaching the discussions with positivity, with the contacts reportedly taking place with ""Saudi support and encouragement"". As part of the initiative, Israel is reported to have already approached airlines in Jordan and Bahrain – both of which Tel Aviv has open ties with – with the proposal to operate direct flights between Ben Gurion Airport and Saudi Arabia, particularly its port city of Jeddah. READ: Israel: normalisation with Saudi Arabia a 'matter of time' It is claimed that Riyadh is putting forward the condition that Palestinians in the Occupied West Bank are also allowed to fly directly from Tel Aviv to Jeddah, as their lack of Israeli citizenship currently restricts them from moving freely within Israel and forces them to travel to Makkah only by transiting third-party countries. The acceptance of that alleged condition will, however, depend on the approval of Israel's internal security service, the Shin Bet. If Tel Aviv and Riyadh do strike a deal on the issue, it is expected that 4,500 Palestinians who are citizens of Israel would potentially be able to travel directly to Saudi Arabia next month in time for the Hajj pilgrimage.

"France summons brother, assistant of Lebanon Central Bank boss in fraud probe",Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 8:18 pm",Europe & Russia+France+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"France's judiciary has summoned the brother of, and an assistant to, Lebanon's Central Bank Governor, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Monday, as it continues its probe into alleged embezzlement and money-laundering by the bank chief, Reuters reports. Central Bank chief, Riad Salameh, his brother, Raja Salameh, and his assistant, Marianne Hoayek, are being investigated in Lebanon, France and other countries for allegedly taking hundreds of millions in funds from the Central Bank. The brothers have denied wrongdoing. Lawyers for Raja and for Hoayek did not respond to separate requests for comment. France has set a hearing in Paris for his brother, Raja, on 31 May and for Hoayek on 13 June, a source close to the matter told Reuters. A Lebanese judicial source confirmed to Reuters that Lebanon's judiciary had received the summons and was working to deliver them. READ: Bahrain to resume diplomatic representation with Lebanon France, last week, issued an arrest warrant for Salameh, 72, after he failed to attend his own hearing in Paris. Interpol subsequently issued a red notice. Lebanon's caretaker Justice Minister, Henry Khoury, told local broadcaster, Al-Jadeed, that he feared more European countries may follow suit and file their own charges against Salameh, which could have consequences on the country's financial situation – already in freefall since 2019. ""The Governor must realise this and resign on his own,"" Khoury said, adding his voice to those of the caretaker deputy Premier and Interior Minister who, last week, said Salameh should step down. Lebanon's cabinet met on Monday afternoon to discuss how the charges against Salameh might affect the Lebanese state and what legal options they may have to remove him, two government sources told Reuters. But the meeting produced no concrete results, according to two separate government sources. A statement issued after the meeting said the cabinet would support whatever action the judiciary decided on.

It would be the Syrian President's first appearance at a global conference since the Syrian uprising and subsequent war began in 2011. ""The UAE, which has shown little leadership on core issues at COP28, like phasing out fossil fuels and stopping new oil and gas expansion, now seems prepared to help Assad burnish his image, despite having overseen crimes against humanity against his own people,"" Saudi and Emirates researcher, Joey Shea, wrote. ""If Assad travels to Dubai, it will mark his third visit to the country since 2022. The UAE government has said nothing in public during any of his visits about the crimes committed under his rule."" Twelve years after the uprising began, thousands of Syrians have been forcibly displaced, and millions forced to leave the country. Political prisoners have been tortured, and many families have no idea where their loved ones are. READ: Syria: Demonstrations against Assad's Arab Summit participation At least 100,000 Syrians have been forcibly disappeared, mostly by the government, and roughly 500,000 people have been killed. Now, with the help of its allies Iran and Russia, Syria has recaptured most of the country. Whilst Assad may attend the climate summit in the UAE, it is unclear whether independent members of Emirati civil society will be able to meaningfully participate. ""Since 2011, UAE authorities have carried out a sustained assault on freedom of expression and association, arresting and imprisoning scores of government critics and activists, including Ahmed Mansoor, a leading Emirati human rights defender,"" added Shea. After Egypt was selected to host COP27, human rights defenders had similar concerns about the meaningful participation of civil society, considering some 60,000 political prisoners are locked up in the country. Authorities constructed a purpose-built protest area out of sight of the conference centre in Sharm El-Sheikh and detained an Indian climate activist as he began an eight-day walk to raise awareness of the climate crisis. Last week, Assad was embraced by regional leaders at the Arab League Summit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after being re-admitted. Syria was suspended in 2011 as it unleashed its deadly crackdown.

"Israel is becoming 'Third World' economy, warn 200 leading economists",Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 3:25 pm",Israel+Middle East+News,"Israel is becoming a Third World economy, over 200 leading Israeli economists warned yesterday in response to the national budget announced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition. Details of this year's budget were revealed by Israel's occupation government in a meeting held in a tunnel underneath Al-Aqsa Mosque. The meeting was seen as an attempt to demonstrates the Zionist state's sovereignty over the occupied city of Jerusalem and its holy sites. The tunnel in question is located under Al-Buraq Wall (the ""Western Wall"") of the Noble Sanctuary of Al-Aqsa. In their warning reported by Haaretz, the academics cited massive subsidies expected to go towards the ultra-Orthodox school system, as well as bigger stipends for full-time yeshiva students. The current far-right Israeli government is heavily influenced by extreme religious parties. Netanyahu is said to have agreed last year to boost public funding substantially for ultra-Orthodox institutions that don't teach core secular subjects such as maths and English, to the tune of billions of shekels a year. READ: Israel aims to be AI superpower, advance autonomous warfare According to Haaretz, concessions made by Netanyahu to build his far-right coalition include an agreement to boost stipends for ultra-Orthodox men who eschew full-time employment for lifetime study in institutes catering for advanced study of the Talmud and rabbinic literature, or a traditional Jewish educational institution yeshiva for married men. Netanyahu also agreed to increase funding for food vouchers from 850 million shekels ($234m) to a billion shekels, despite warnings that the new system for determining eligibility would politicise the social welfare system. ""In order to enable integration into the labour market, children should receive an education that enables this, and adults should face incentives to do so,"" the economists are reported as warning Israel. ""Unfortunately, the Israeli government not only does not deal with this dire issue, but also chooses measures that exacerbate the problem and deteriorate the future of Israel's economy towards the Third World."" Relations between the ultra-Orthodox and secular communities are extremely fraught in Israel. Tensions are said to be extremely high, so much so that the two communities are ""Heading for War"" according to one Israeli commentator. Secular Israelis are said to be incensed over the billions of shekels earmarked for the Haredi community and their educational institutions. According to Education Ministry documents obtained by Haaretz, in 2019 more than 90,000 Haredi students – 27 per cent of all ultra-Orthodox students – were excused from studying core secular subjects that year. Resentment is fuelled further because the Haredi community is growing at a much higher rate than any other group and only contributes two per cent to government revenue from income tax.

The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt.""

The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours.

Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

"Russia, Somalia mull establishment of platform for trade cooperation",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 8:11 pm",Africa+Europe & Russia+News+Russia+Somalia,"Somali Foreign Minister, Abshir Omar Jama, said on Friday that he discussed a possibility of creating trade platforms with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting in Moscow, Anadolu Agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Jama said the Russian establishment of such a platform would allow Russian and Somalia trade operators and businesses to interact more effectively and use existing opportunities more efficiently. Lavrov, for his part, said Moscow expressed support for the Somali leadership in state-building, strengthening, unity of the country, steps to stabilise the internal situation and the fight against terrorism and extremism.

The Minister stressed that Russia is in favour of ""African solution to African problems,"" and for taking into account the interests of the African continent when addressing the issue of reforming the UN Security Council.

Turkiye homes in northern Syria for voluntary return of Syria refugees,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 8:07 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Ankara is currently working on the safe return of Syrian refugees in Turkiye to their country, Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said, as Syrian citizens praise the peaceful atmosphere created in Syria after their voluntary return, Anadolu Agency reports. Erdogan, on Thursday, also noted that ""with the support of Qatar, the work to build houses in Syria, which can accommodate 1 million refugees, continues."" Wafaa Mustafa Hajjaj, a Syrian citizen who lives with her child and nephews in Azaz in the countryside of Aleppo, told Anadolu that she came to Turkiye for treatment after she lost her eyesight in an attack on her village. Hajjaj, who stayed in Turkiye for five years, pointed out that during each stay, Turkish people have always supported her and her family. Hajjaj noted that she voluntarily returned to Syria.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. It has made little progress on reforms required by the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol Red Notice.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

Women 'most important heroes' of Turkiye struggle to serve nation: President,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:26 pm",Europe & Russia+News+Turkey,"Turkiye has realised many projects about women to enhance their area of ​​freedom, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, Anadolu Agency reports. ""Over the course of our 40-year-long journey in politics, we have always walked shoulder to shoulder with our women … We have always overcome the obstacles raised before us and the attacks that even reached the point of targeting our lives with the support of women. ""Today, I would like to underline, once again, that women are the most important heroes of our struggle to serve our country and nation,"" Erdogan said at a meeting with women's societies in Istanbul. Turkiye has expanded the areas of freedom, employment and representation of women without any discrimination, he stressed. ""We have increased the rate of women completing at least one level of education from 70 per cent to 88 per cent. We have increased women in employment from 6 million to 10.5 million,"" Erdogan said. The President added that the efforts and labour of women contributed to Turkiye's progress in all areas from economy to trade, from rights and freedoms to agriculture, tourism, education and health. Erdogan also hailed Diyarbakir mothers who continue their sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye. ""I pay my respects to the mothers of Diyarbakir, who have been on the guard for months to take back their children that the separatist organisation forcibly smuggled into the mountains,"" he said. He added that the mothers defy terrorist organisations through their watch for their children. The sit-in protest against the PKK terror group in south-eastern Turkiye began in September 2019 in Diyarbakir, when three mothers said their children had been forcibly recruited by YPG/PKK terrorists. The sit-in outside the offices of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) – a party currently facing a closure case, and which the government accuses of having links to the terrorist YPG/PKK – has been growing every day. Demonstrations have also spread to other provinces, including Van, Mus, Sirnak and Hakkari.

Israel mulls imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:14 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Israeli government is considering a bill aimed at imposing restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, local media reported yesterday. According to media reports, the bill states that any nonprofit group that engages in public advocacy two years before or after receiving a donation from a foreign government will lose its status as a public institution and will no longer be eligible for tax exemptions. In addition, those non-profits will be hit with a 65 per cent income tax. The reports indicated that many organisations in Israel and the Palestinian territories depend on foreign funding, and the proposed bill could severely impact their ability to operate. The legislation, drafted by a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, Ariel Kallner, is set to be brought before the Knesset's high-level Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday. Kallner said the goal of the tax is to ""prevent foreign interests from gaining the upper hand.""

Anger and fear among Syrians amid Turkiye opposition anti-immigrant campaign,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 5:08 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Like many Syrians in Turkiye, Ghaith Sameer is awaiting the result of Sunday's election runoff with trepidation, fearing a win for an opposition candidate who promises to swiftly repatriate migrants, Reuters reports. Sameer fled Syria's civil war in 2012 and is now one of over 3.4 million Syrians living in neighbouring Turkiye, where economic woes have aggravated a rising tide of hostility that has washed into the presidential election. ""The opposition's promises frighten me and make me angry, as well, because they make Turkish citizens hate us,"" said Sameer, who took Turkish nationality two years ago and plans to vote on Sunday for President Tayyip Erdogan. While Erdogan has a good chance to win the runoff after falling just short of an outright first-round victory two weeks ago, his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has embraced anti-migrant rhetoric to try to turn the race around. READ: The Syrians in Turkiye are between a rock and a hard place Kilicdaroglu has teamed up with a far-right nationalist party and promised to repatriate all migrants within a year, as posters bearing his face have sprouted across Turkish cities vowing that Syrians will leave. Although Erdogan has been more welcoming to Syrians and other migrants in Turkiye, which has the world's biggest refugee population of 5 million, he has also made moves to accelerate a return of migrants to Syria. For Syrians, the election and the anti-migrant turn in Turkish politics have cast new uncertainty over their future, causing many to wonder if they will have to start again, having already fled a deadly war in their homeland. Sameer, 38, said many of his friends and relatives were putting off plans until after the election when things would be clearer, with his brother even waiting to replace a broken food processor. ""Most Syrians now feel as if the course of their entire lives depends on the results of the elections,"" he lamented. Even though he has Turkish citizenship, Sameer has still been making alternative plans ""in case anything happens"". He has even considered moving with his wife and two small children to a country where conditions for Syrians might be better, such as Egypt or the Kurdish region of Iraq. When Kilicdaroglu announced a deal on Wednesday for far-right Victory Party leader, Umit Ozdag, to back him in the runoff, Ozdag said their promised departure of migrants would lift ""the burden"" on the economy and stop Turkiye becoming ""migrant-istan"". Playing on xenophobic stereotypes that accuse Syrians and Afghan refugees of theft, sexual harassment and other crimes, Ozdag said repatriating migrants would ""make the streets safe again"". Such language and Kilicdaroglu's new anti-migrant posters that hang from lamp posts and over underpasses have been particularly alarming for Syrians. ""Can anyone with even a shred of humanity accept to see signs hanging on the walls of schools and crowded streets threatening to deport Syrians?"" asked Ahmad, a 40-year-old Syrian who, like Sameer, now has Turkish nationality. READ: Is Turkiye democratic enough not to apply forced repatriation and politicising refugees? Ahmad, who withheld his family name fearing repercussions, said he was worried how the signs would affect Syrian children who can read Turkish because they are educated in the language, and described it as ""repulsive and disgusting hate speech"". Most major warfare has been paused in Syria for years, with Turkiye controlling enclaves across the border where it backs rebels against President Bashar Al-Assad and which are already crowded with displaced people from other parts of Syria. Life across the border is brutally hard, with damaged infrastructure, a ravaged economy and the constant threat that war could suddenly erupt again. People in rebel-held territory fear reprisals if the government retakes those areas. With their fate a growing political issue, many Syrians may still feel unease even if Erdogan beats Kilicdaroglu on Sunday, noting his administration's plans for new housing projects across the border to accelerate their eventual repatriation. Like other regional leaders, Erdogan is also mending fences with Assad,  raising the possibility of a rapprochement that could worry many Syrians in Turkiye. Saad Abdalkader, who has lived in Turkiye since 2015, said he could envisage no stability in Syria while Assad held power, and was considering travelling onwards to Europe in search of safety. He recounted an incident when a friend was robbed, but feared he would be assaulted if he went to the police to illustrate the precarious position many Syrians feel themselves to be in Turkiye. Omar Kadkoy, a Syrian working at the Ankara-based economic think tank, TEPAV, said Syrians still faced ""misery and fear"" in their home country, which would feel like a foreign land to their children. ""It isn't an easy decision to make,"" he said of returning voluntarily, adding that for Syrian children in Turkiye: ""They're moulded by everything that is Turkish. To them, Syria is a bed-time story.""

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

""The UN was so strong that, in 1948, it managed to create the State of Israel. In 2023, it fails to create a Palestinian state,"" Lula said. Speaking during an official visit to Spain, Lula continued: ""We live in the world where the UN Security Council, the permanent members, they are the ones who sell the most weapons in the world, they are the biggest participants in wars in the world."" ""When the United States invaded Iraq, there was no discussion in the Security Council. When France and England invaded Libya and when Russia invaded Ukraine, there was no discussion either,"" he added. Astonished by the reduced role non-member states play in the international organisation, he asked the UN Security Council not to limit itself to its permanent members. ""I am therefore left wondering whether it is up to us, other countries that are not permanent [members] of the UN Security Council, to make a change. Why aren't Brazil, Spain, Japan, Germany, India, Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa [ permanent members]? The winners of the Second World War currently determine that, but the world has changed."" ""We need to build a new international mechanism that does things differently. I think it's time for us to start changing things and it's time for us to create a G20 of Peace, which should be the UN,"" he said. His calls were slammed by the pro-Israel group, StandWithUs Brasil, who said: ""Contrary to what the president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said, Israel was not created by the United Nations. In 1947, what the UN Partition advocated was the creation of two countries, one for Jews and the other for Arabs. The Jews accepted; the Arabs did not."" ""The State of Israel was founded after a war waged by the armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq against the Jews."" ""As for a State for Palestinians, neither the UN nor other international organisations currently have the role of creating it, unless Palestinians and Israelis themselves come to seal the peace independently,"" the statement added.

Israel opposition slams Ben-Gvir's storming of Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa complex,Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 3:22 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, on Monday slammed far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir's storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in Occupied East Jerusalem, Anadolu News Agency reports. The far-right official forced his way into the flashpoint site, early Sunday, under Israeli police protection, in the second such visit since he joined the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late last year. Ben-Gvir then claimed Israel's ownership of the complex in a video message from the Mosque's courtyard. ""His duty is to ease the tension, but Ben-Gvir creates provocation, instead,"" Lapid, the head of Yesh Atid (There is a Future) Party, told Israeli Army Radio. READ: Israel is becoming Third World economy, warn 200 leading economists Describing Ben-Gvir as Israel's most controversial politician, Lapid, a former prime minister, said Ben-Gvir is ""an irresponsible and fanatical man"" who should not have been allowed to become a National Security Minister. Ben-Gvir holds far-right views on the Palestinians and has called for their displacement. He has repeatedly joined Israeli settlers in storming the flashpoint Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in East Jerusalem. Last November, Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, warned in a leaked audio that ""the whole world is worried"" about Ben-Gvir's far-right views. Israel has allowed settlers into the Al-Aqsa complex almost on a daily basis since 2003, with the exception of Fridays and Saturdays. For Muslims, Al-Aqsa represents Islam's third-holiest site. Jews call the area the Temple Mount, saying it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times. Israel occupied East Jerusalem, where Al-Aqsa is located, during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. It annexed the entire city in 1980, in a move never recognised by the international community.

Iran top security official implies he is stepping down after nearly 10 years,Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 2:52 pm",Asia & Americas+Iran+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"The head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) in a cryptic Twitter post, Sunday evening, implied he is leaving his position after nearly 10 years, fuelling debate about his succession, Anadolu News Agency reports. Ali Shamkhani posted a verse from 16th-century Iranian poet, Muhtasham Kashani, in a tweet, which immediately fuelled speculation about his resignation. Nour News, which is affiliated with the SNSC, said the top security official's departure is ""certain"". Shamkhani, an ethnic Arab, has held the post of SNSC Secretary since September 2013 when he replaced Saeed Jalili, a top conservative figure and a former presidential candidate. Shamkhani is the second-longest serving top security official in the country after former President, Hassan Rouhani, who held the chair for 16 years from 1989 to 2005. A veteran of the Iran-Iraq War who served as the Naval Commander in both the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the army, Shamkhani went on to become the Minister of Defense in 1997 and also ran for the presidency in 2001. He is also a military advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. READ: Gunmen kill 5 Iran border guards near Pakistan border Shamkhani, in March, led talks on behalf of Iran with Saudi Arabia in Beijing that led to the restoration of diplomatic ties between the two regional rivals after seven years.

Shamkhani was, in February 2020, put on a sanctions list by the US Treasury Department, a month after the US State Department had designated him. Official confirmation of his stepping down as head of the SNSC has not come yet, but speculation is already rife about possible candidates who can replace him.

Israel: major newspaper publishes 'Palestine must be obliterated' article,Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 2:25 pm",International Organisations+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+UN,"The Times of Israel published an article on Thursday which readers say called openly for the genocide of the Palestinians. The article was deleted by the newspaper, presumably due to the backlash, but it remains accessible on the Internet Archive. ""In order to make peace and move forward, Palestine must be obliterated,"" said the article's author, Jeffrey Camras. ""It [Palestine] is an afront to society, morality, humanity. It represents lies and anti-Semitism, oppression and terror. Nothing more."" Camras made his call for the obliteration of Palestine while living in Chicago. He describes himself as having ""a deep love for the Jewish people and the state of Israel."" He also describes himself as someone who ""resides in the diaspora."" In his article, Camras also advocated for the right of conquest. ""How to say this simply. They lost! They don't get to dictate any terms. What world do we live in that every country throughout history has established its borders and conquered land through war, and we collectively decide we don't do this any more with Israel in 1948?"" OPINION: Remembering the Tantura Massacre The right of powers to take possession of territory by force was proscribed after the Second World War. The practice was added to the list of crimes against peace, introduced in the Nuremberg Principles. Drafted in 1947, the principals are a set of guidelines for determining what constitutes a war crime. The document was created by the International Law Commission of the UN to codify the legal principles underlying the Nuremberg trials of Nazi party members following World War Two. ""No one cares about the Palestinians,"" claimed Camras. ""Care for them solely exists in the form of anti-Israel advocacy, not pro-Palestinian support."" He cited the fact that six million Palestinian refugees still live in refugee camps in surrounding countries to support his claim. He omitted to say that Israel has consistently refused Palestinian refugees to exercise their legitimate right of return to their land following the ethnic cleansing that started in 1948. That is why millions of Palestinians remain stateless. The right of return is a fundamental principal under international law. There are no conditions under which derogation is permitted in the implementation of this basic right. Following the expulsion of three quarters of the Palestinian population, Israel introduced the discriminatory ""Law of Return"". Based on ""the right"" to undo injustices carried out three thousand years prior to Israel's creation, it permitted Jews in the Diaspora to ""return"" while denying Palestinians the same right, even though they were expelled two years prior to the introduction of the so-called Israeli Law of Return. It was unclear when the article was removed from the Times of Israel website, but according to the version seen by MEMO in the Internet Archive, the entry was posted on Thursday, 18 May, at 3:32pm. This means that the call for the obliteration of Palestine coincided with the hateful Israeli ""Flag March"" in occupied Jerusalem. The march is condemned internationally because of the provocation and racism of thousands of extremist Israeli settlers rampaging through Palestinian neighbourhoods in the occupied city.

Spotify and Apple Music delete Palestine song 'Dammi Falastini' following accusations of anti-Semitism,Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 2:25 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"UPDATE on 23 May 2023 at 09:20 GMT: Dammi Falastini has been relisted on Spotify after a new licence agreement was signed for it, claims it was removed because of anti-Semitism accusations have been refuted by music experts who have explained that 'distribution agreements either expire or are renegotiated, songs disappear for a bit, then once a new deal is in place, songs reappear'. The hit song, 'Dammi Falastini', which was recorded by Palestinian singer from Gaza, Mohammed Assaf, has been removed from Spotify and Apple Music due to accusations of anti-Semitism. Translating into ""My Blood is Palestinian"", the singer received an official email citing allegations of incitement against Israel as the reason for the song's deletion. In an interview with The New Arab, the Palestinian singer, who was born and raised in Gaza, expressed his surprise as his initial reaction after finding out that his song had been removed from the platforms, but emphasised that he was also honoured as the song achieved its goal of ""expressing the Palestinian people's resistance"". He said, ""I checked my official page on the Spotify and Apple Music platforms and was surprised that the song 'Ana Dammi Falastini' was deleted."" ""I received an official email about it, on the pretext that the song incites the Zionist enemy, which makes me more honoured that my songs express the Palestinian people's resistance to the Occupation,"" he added. WATCH: Germany: Jewish Nakba rally stopped for 'anti-Semitism' According to Doha News, the removal of the song by the streaming giant came following a petition organised by pro-Zionist We Believe in Israel (WBII) to remove ""violent extremist anti-Semitic content"" which collected nearly 4,000 signatures. In response, the 33-year-old singer, who released 'Dammi Falastini' eight years ago, said, ""This accusation increases my honour and belonging to my homeland, Palestine, and my just cause"", and that ""even if they delete this song, it is present in the memory and conscience of every Palestinian and every honourable free man who defends the right of the Palestinian people to obtain their freedom and independence."" He further noted that the removal of the song only indicated ""their hostility to freedom and justice, and to the Palestinians cause."" The move by Spotify and Apple Music also sparked a backlash on social media from pro-Palestinian activists, including threats of deactivating the music-streaming service. Inès Abdel Razek, the Advocacy Director for the Palestinian Institute for Public Diplomacy, wrote: Spotify deleted the song ""dammi falastini"" (my blood is Palestinian) , the hit song by Mohammad Assaf.

Since mid-April, the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been exchanging heavy fire, accusing each other of starting assaults. According to an Anadolu reporter on the ground, heavy clashes were heard on Sunday night in several areas across Khartoum, including central Khartoum, the northern Bahri area and Omdurman western Khartoum.

Turkiye: Cavusoglu reveals roadmap for return of Syrian refugees,Unknown,"May 22, 2023 at 12:48 pm",Arab League+EU+Europe & Russia+International Organisations+Middle East+News+Qatar+Saudi Arabia+Syria+Turkey+UAE,"The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has unveiled a ""roadmap"" for the return of Syrian refugees, including safe zones and government-controlled areas. The plan has been prepared following a meeting in Moscow earlier this month between the foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey, Iran and the Syrian regime. Relations between Turkey and the Syrian regime will be developed as part of the plan, in coordination with the defence and intelligence ministries of the four countries. They emphasised the ""voluntary, safe and dignified return of Syrian refugees to their homeland."" In an interview with Haber Turk TV channel, Turkiye's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu emphasised that the issue of Syrian refugees has become an ""electoral tool"", but it should not be resolved by the kind of ""populism"" endorsed by opposition groups. Practical solutions are required, he insisted. ""Around 550,000 Syrians have returned to their country, and this is not enough,"" explained Cavusoglu. ""More of them must return. We have entered into a dialogue with the regime in this regard and we have decided to establish the infrastructure for this return."" This, he added, prompted him to go to Moscow for the quadripartite meeting to discuss the issue of refugees before the presidential and parliamentary elections in Turkiye held last weekend. ""We are developing a roadmap that also includes reviving the political process, cleansing Syria from terrorism, and ensuring the safe return of refugees. Syrians do not want to return to areas where terrorism exists, such as the areas under the control of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which the Syrian Kurds refuse to return to due to the control of the [People's Defence Units, the YPG], not only areas under the control of Daesh/ISIS."" READ: Turkiye people will show strong democracy in upcoming election runoff: President Erdogan The minister stressed that return without cooperation with the regime is not correct. ""Ensuring the safety of the returnees must be guaranteed, and the UN should be involved in this phase. Moreover, the EU and the international community should support the roadmap."" More Syrians must be returned to the safe areas and areas under Assad's control, added Cavusoglu. He pointed out that there are agreements in place with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. ""The return of the Assad regime to the Arab League is a beneficial factor at this stage."" The timeline for the refugees' return covers a period for the construction of essential facilities. Some Arab states, said the Turkish minister, are backing this. The issue of Syrian refugees was used by candidates in the Turkish elections, with the right-wing opposition exploiting it to attract votes. Official figures confirm that 3.5 million Syrians are registered in Turkiye for temporary protection, but the opposition claims that the number is ten million and demands their immediate deportation. Scaremongering has seen claims that another 10-20 million Syrians might arrive in Turkey, according to a video released by presidential candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu on Saturday. Cavusoglu discussed this in his TV interview, as well as Kilicdaroglu's allegation that Russia is interfering in the Turkish elections. ""We asked Kilicdaroglu whether he has any evidence that supports his claims,"" said the minister, ""and asked him to provide any information he knows in this regard."" The response was that it was merely ""an impression,"" he revealed. ""The opposition leader should be more serious when touching on such issues.""

Last week, after the ships docked at Oman's Salalah port upon its return to Iran, Navy commander Real Admiral Shahram Irani said the US had failed to prevent it from sailing through the Panama Canal. The flotilla entered the first naval zone of the country on Saturday in the port city of Bandar Abbas and was welcomed by Rear Admiral Shahram Irani and other senior navy officials. Shahrami said during the ceremony that the successful voyage shows the US-led world order ""has been replaced by a multi-polar world order."" In his message on Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed the ""grand and successful naval mission"" of the Iranian Navy flotilla.

Turkiye 'strongly condemns' Israeli security minister's raid on Al-Aqsa Mosque complex,Unknown,"May 21, 2023 at 2:24 pm",Europe & Russia+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+Turkey,"The Turkish Foreign Ministry on Sunday ""strongly condemned"" Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in occupied East Jerusalem, Anadolu reports. ""We strongly condemn the storming of Al-Haram Al-Sharif on 21 May by the Israeli Minister of National Security under the protection of Israeli security forces in clear breach of the international law,"" the ministry said in a written statement. Entering the Haram al-Sharif area early in the morning with special guards and under the protection of the Israeli forces, Ben-Gvir claimed Israel's ownership of the complex in a video message from the mosque's courtyard. Ankara called on Israel to ""act responsibly, and to put an end to all kinds of provocative actions violating the historical status of Al-Haram Al-Sharif that is based on the international law."" ""It is in no way acceptable that Israeli Government members challenge the historical status of Al-Haram Al-Sharif in this manner and commit inflammatory and fascistic actions,"" the Turkish ministry added. READ: Palestine warns of 'religious war' after Israeli minister's visit to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa This was the second time Ben-Gvir entered the complex since taking office as national security minister in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last December. Ben-Gvir previously entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Jan. 3, days after he took office, and with this action, he became the first Israeli minister on duty to enter the mosque in five years. Holding far-right views on Palestinians and having called for their displacement, Ben-Gvir has repeatedly joined Israeli settlers in storming the flashpoint Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in East Jerusalem. For Muslims, Al-Aqsa represents the world's third-holiest site. Jews call the area the Temple Mount, saying it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times. Israel occupied East Jerusalem, where Al-Aqsa is located, during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. It annexed the entire city in 1980 in a move never recognized by the international community. Last November, Israeli President Isaac Herzog warned in a leaked audio that ""the whole world is worried"" about Ben-Gvir's far-right views.

Tens of thousands protest against planned Israeli judicial overhaul,Unknown,"May 21, 2023 at 2:16 pm",Israel+Middle East+News,"Tens of thousands of Israelis joined protests across the country, now entering their 20th week, on Saturday against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's contested plans to tighten controls on the Supreme Court, Reuters reports. The planned overhaul, which would give the government control over naming judges to the Supreme Court and let parliament override many rulings, was paused after opponents organised some of the biggest street protests ever seen in Israel. The government accuses activist judges of increasingly usurping the role of parliament, and says the overhaul is needed to restore balance between the judiciary and elected politicians. Critics say it will remove vital checks and balances underpinning a democratic state and hand unchecked power to the government. A sea of blue and white Israeli flags, which have become a symbol of the protests, coated a central highway in Tel Aviv. Protestors chanted, ""Israel is almost a dictatorship,"" as a banner reading ""stop them"" was held up by the crowd. ""It scares me that we are still a few hours away at any given moment from turning from a democracy to a dictatorship,"" Sagi Mizrahi, a 40-year-old computer programmer told Reuters in Tel Aviv. ""I'm here because of the judicial system and the laws that are still sitting on the table, it's just scary."" Protests garnered lower attendance last Saturday as a truce between Israel and the Islamic Jihad group officially came into effect, ending a five-day escalation which was the worst episode of cross-border fire since a 10-day war in 2021. Protests seemed to have been invigorated with Hebrew media estimating some 90,000-100,000 in attendance. The police force did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""Gradually, myself my kids and my grandkids are losing the hope to live here in a democratic state and to have a normal life like every person deserves,"" Hava Golan, 65 year-old biology professor said.

Former Israeli soldier returns key to Al-Aqsa Mosque after 56 years,Unknown,"May 21, 2023 at 1:51 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"A former Israeli soldier handed back a key Thursday for a gate of Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem after stealing it 56 years ago, Anadolu reports. The Islamic Endowments Department in Jerusalem published a video showing its director general Sheikh Azzam Al-Khatib receiving the key from the man, identified as Yair Barack. In the video, Barack said he was part of the Israeli battalion that fought on the East Jerusalem front, adding that many of his comrades died during the fighting in 1967. ""I arrived at the Al-Mughrabi Gate (in the western corridor of Al-Aqsa Mosque)…and when I looked at the left side, I found a key. I don't know why I put my hand on it and took it,"" he said. ""I put the key in my pocket, and since then, I've had it in my possession,"" he added. Barack said that after 40 or 50 years, he began feeling uncomfortable that the key was still with him ""simply because I stole it and I now decided to return it."" ""Now I am here. I returned the key that I had stolen. I returned it back to its owners…and this is what Israel should do — to return back to the Palestinians their land, rights, respect, independence, freedom and security,"" he said. He said that after returning the key, he felt he ""did the right thing."" His handing back of the key came as Israeli settlers along with scores of Israeli officials joined a ""flag march"" to celebrate their occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967. Commenting on the controversial march, he said this is one of the worst days in the year for him, adding he stopped celebrating ""flag day"" a long time ago. The Flag March is staged by Israeli settlers every year to mark what they call the unification of Jerusalem, in reference to Israel's occupation of the city in 1967. ""I was part of it at that day. I wished I didn't do it, which is occupying Jerusalem,"" he said. Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.

Palestine warns of 'religious war' after Israeli minister's visit to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa,Unknown,"May 21, 2023 at 1:32 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Palestinian Authority (PA) on Sunday strongly condemned Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in occupied East Jerusalem, Anadolu reports. The far-right minister had forced his way into the flashpoint site early Sunday under Israeli police protection. ""Any harm to Al-Aqsa Mosque is playing with fire and will drag the region into a religious war with undesirable consequences that will affect everyone,"" PA spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in a statement. He stressed that such acts ""will not impose Israeli sovereignty over the site."" The Palestinian spokesman appealed for immediate action from the US and the international community to maintain the status quo at the Al-Aqsa complex. The status quo allows Muslims to worship at the Al-Aqsa compound and followers of other religions to visit the site. Since 2003, Israel has allowed settlers into the compound almost on a daily basis with the exception of Fridays and Saturdays. For Muslims, Al-Aqsa represents Islam's third-holiest site.

New Israel law to expel Arab students raising Palestine flag,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 1:15 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The extremist Israeli government is preparing a law to dismiss Israeli Arab students who raise the Palestine flag or express their support for Palestinian resistance inside universities, Israel Hayom revealed on Thursday. An extremist Israeli Mk from the far-right Otzma Yehudit Party is preparing the law, the Israeli newspaper disclosed, pointing out that the draft law is currently in its final stages. If an Arab student is charged with raising the Palestine flag or supporting the Palestinian resistance against the Israeli occupation, according to the law, they would be dismissed from their university. Meanwhile, the law calls for academic institutions to prevent the existence of student bodies that violate Israeli laws. According to the Israeli daily, heads of Israeli universities strongly criticised the law, stressing: ""It is problematic and dangerous."" Heads of Israeli universities expressed their hope that the education minister would undermine the law proposal at the Knesset's Legislative Committee. READ: Israel university authorities slam bill criminalising the Palestinian flag as 'fascist' They suggested that such a law aims to turn universities into arms for the Israeli police and intelligence services as they would be ordered to monitor thousands of students and punish them over issues protected under the freedom of expression laws. At the same time, the university heads indicated that such a law has consequences for the academic ties and status between Israeli universities and their international counterparts. In addition, it would lead to a wide-scale wave of academic boycotts of Israeli universities. Head of Tel Aviv University Ariel Porat responded to the law proposal: ""The Palestinian Authority is not a hostile state or a terrorist organisation. Raising its flag is protected under the freedom of expression law."" Porat added: ""If we applied this law, we would be likely obliged to have a large number of our students away from the university. They would not bear this suppression and would not hesitate to raise the PA flag."" The current Israeli government is the most extremist ever in Israel's history.

"Kuwait, Philippines crisis after workers' visa suspensions",Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 12:30 pm",Asia & Americas+Kuwait+Middle East+News+Philippines,"A new conflict has occurred between Kuwait and the Philippines over the protection of domestic workers and the rights of Kuwaiti employers after the Gulf state suspended visas for Filipino workers due to the ""wrong practices"" by the Philippines Embassy in the country. With about a quarter of a million Filipino workers in Kuwait, most of whom are domestic workers, the differences between the two countries are not new. There have been several rounds of talks in the past to reach understandings, but it seems they haven't reached a resolution that satisfies both parties. The suspension of visas comes after the Philippines stopped sending domestic workers to Kuwait in February for the first time after the body of Jullebee Ranara was found in the Kuwaiti desert in January. Large numbers of Filipino nationals work abroad, with about 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product coming from expat transfers. On Wednesday, Kuwait's Ministry of Interior confirmed in a statement that it had suspended visas for Filipino workers ""as a result of the wrong practices"" of the Philippines Embassy in Kuwait as well as the ""crimes"" committed by some members of the Filipino community against Kuwaitis. The statement indicated that the most prominent violation is the embassy's sheltering of Filipino workers in a centre for it, communicating with Kuwaiti citizens and summoning them without the permission of the Kuwaiti authorities, forcing travel agencies to search for runaway domestic workers and ""playing the role of state institutions"" and pressuring Kuwaiti employers to add contractual clauses against their will. The statement added that Kuwait stipulated during the talks the ""recognition and acknowledgement"" of the embassy of the Philippines that it had violated Kuwaiti laws and decisions and had breached diplomatic norms. It also asked that it promises not to repeat these acts. In return, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior will assess the situation and ensure that the embassy adheres to the conditions for at least three months: ""After which it decides what it deems appropriate."" READ: Kuwait to continue ban on visas for Philippines workers after talks fail to resolve labour dispute The statement said that the Philippine side rejected these conditions and, therefore, the Ministry of Interior: ""Adheres to its position rejecting any violations of the state's sovereignty and the dignity of its citizens and continues its decision to suspend all types of visas for the Filipino community until further notice,"" while continuing to renew the residency of those who have a valid residency. A crisis between the two countries ended more than five years ago with the Philippine side's apology in 2018 for what Kuwait considered a violation of its sovereignty after the Philippines Embassy in Kuwait ""rescued"" a number of Filipinos working in homes amid reports of violations. The Philippine Foreign Minister said at the time that the embassy had to ""help"" Filipino workers who sought help because some situations were considered a matter of life or death, stressing respect for Kuwait's sovereignty and laws: ""But the interest of Filipino workers is also very important."" The Philippine side did not comment on the Kuwaiti statement. However, after the two sides' talks last week, the Philippine Foreign Ministry shared that its delegation affirmed its ""full respect for Kuwaiti laws."" The statement on 18 May conveyed the measures taken by the Embassy and Government of the Philippines regarding the services provided to the migrant workers: ""Are solely to ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens."" The Philippines' Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega remarked in press statements last week that Kuwait's suspension of entry visas for Filipinos came in response to Manila's suspension of sending new domestic workers to the Gulf country in February, and that the Kuwaiti decision aims to pressure his country to lift this ban. De Vega noted that Kuwait is concerned about two issues and considers them a violation of its laws, namely the establishment of a shelter for runaway domestic workers and communicating with Kuwaiti employers regarding reports of violations. He added: ""Providing protection to a country's citizens abroad is a well-established duty of consular offices under international law and convention,"" adding that they do not encourage them to run away from their employers, but in the case of abuse, they should have a place to go to.

READ: Algeria: Controversy over Emir Abdelkader statue Al-Quds Al-Arabi researcher and political activist Hassan Zarkouni criticised Touahria's statement: ""How will Algeria coordinate with Italy to maintain stability in Tunisia? Will this be done through the GALSI project for gas transportation, which ignores Tunisian territory, knowing that nearly 55 per cent of the gas in Tunisia comes from Algeria and that 98 per cent of electricity is gas-generated? Or will it be through allowing the pollution of the Mjerdah Basin with industrial and urban waste? Or by misusing the shared groundwater resources between the Algerian Souf Valley and the Tunisian Ghardimaou region, which goes against our bilateral agreements and treaties?""

Reporters Without Borders calls for Egypt to release Tawfik Ghanem,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 10:37 am",Africa+Egypt+International Organisations+News+Reporters Without Borders (RSF)+UN,"Reporters Without Borders has called on the Egyptian authorities to release Tawfik Ghanem, the former bureau chief of the Anadolu Agency office in Cairo, noting that he had begun his third year in detention without being brought to trial. The organisation stated on its website, signed by the head of its Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, that imprisonment without trial is a common practice in Egypt, where 12 of the 20 imprisoned journalists are being held in pre-trial detention. The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt."" Ghanem has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years, as his provisional detention has been renewed every 15 to 45 days since 26 May, 2021. READ: UN: Malnutrition risk for half a million Yemen children Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Egyptian code of criminal procedure has a two-year limit on pre-trial detention, regardless of the charges. However, Ghanem is still being detained and deprived of medical care. He is 69 years old and suffers from serious health problems, including being diabetic. The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours. The authorities promised to do this but never fulfilled their promise. ""The Egyptian authorities must stop using provisional detention as a punitive tool against journalists. Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

"Brazil´s president: The UN was so strong enough to create Israel, but now can't create a Palestinian state",Unknown,"April 28, 2023 at 11:43 am",Africa+Asia & Americas+Brazil+Egypt+Europe & Russia+France+Germany+India+International Organisations+Iraq+Israel+Japan+Libya+Middle East+News+Nigeria+Palestine+South Africa+Spain+UK+UN+US,"Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva this week slammed the UN's inability to create a Palestinian State in the same manner that it established the state of Israel in 1948. ""The UN was so strong that, in 1948, it managed to create the State of Israel. In 2023, it fails to create a Palestinian state,"" Lula said. Speaking during an official visit to Spain, Lula continued: ""We live in the world where the UN Security Council, the permanent members, they are the ones who sell the most weapons in the world, they are the biggest participants in wars in the world."" ""When the United States invaded Iraq, there was no discussion in the Security Council. When France and England invaded Libya and when Russia invaded Ukraine, there was no discussion either,"" he added. Astonished by the reduced role non-member states play in the international organisation, he asked the UN Security Council not to limit itself to its permanent members. ""I am therefore left wondering whether it is up to us, other countries that are not permanent [members] of the UN Security Council, to make a change. Why aren't Brazil, Spain, Japan, Germany, India, Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa [ permanent members]? The winners of the Second World War currently determine that, but the world has changed."" ""We need to build a new international mechanism that does things differently. I think it's time for us to start changing things and it's time for us to create a G20 of Peace, which should be the UN,"" he said. His calls were slammed by the pro-Israel group, StandWithUs Brasil, who said: ""Contrary to what the president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said, Israel was not created by the United Nations. In 1947, what the UN Partition advocated was the creation of two countries, one for Jews and the other for Arabs. The Jews accepted; the Arabs did not."" ""The State of Israel was founded after a war waged by the armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq against the Jews."" ""As for a State for Palestinians, neither the UN nor other international organisations currently have the role of creating it, unless Palestinians and Israelis themselves come to seal the peace independently,"" the statement added.

Tens of thousands protest against planned Israeli judicial overhaul,Unknown,"May 21, 2023 at 2:16 pm",Israel+Middle East+News,"Tens of thousands of Israelis joined protests across the country, now entering their 20th week, on Saturday against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's contested plans to tighten controls on the Supreme Court, Reuters reports. The planned overhaul, which would give the government control over naming judges to the Supreme Court and let parliament override many rulings, was paused after opponents organised some of the biggest street protests ever seen in Israel. The government accuses activist judges of increasingly usurping the role of parliament, and says the overhaul is needed to restore balance between the judiciary and elected politicians. Critics say it will remove vital checks and balances underpinning a democratic state and hand unchecked power to the government. A sea of blue and white Israeli flags, which have become a symbol of the protests, coated a central highway in Tel Aviv. Protestors chanted, ""Israel is almost a dictatorship,"" as a banner reading ""stop them"" was held up by the crowd. ""It scares me that we are still a few hours away at any given moment from turning from a democracy to a dictatorship,"" Sagi Mizrahi, a 40-year-old computer programmer told Reuters in Tel Aviv. ""I'm here because of the judicial system and the laws that are still sitting on the table, it's just scary."" Protests garnered lower attendance last Saturday as a truce between Israel and the Islamic Jihad group officially came into effect, ending a five-day escalation which was the worst episode of cross-border fire since a 10-day war in 2021. Protests seemed to have been invigorated with Hebrew media estimating some 90,000-100,000 in attendance. The police force did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""Gradually, myself my kids and my grandkids are losing the hope to live here in a democratic state and to have a normal life like every person deserves,"" Hava Golan, 65 year-old biology professor said.

Former Israeli soldier returns key to Al-Aqsa Mosque after 56 years,Unknown,"May 21, 2023 at 1:51 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"A former Israeli soldier handed back a key Thursday for a gate of Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem after stealing it 56 years ago, Anadolu reports. The Islamic Endowments Department in Jerusalem published a video showing its director general Sheikh Azzam Al-Khatib receiving the key from the man, identified as Yair Barack. In the video, Barack said he was part of the Israeli battalion that fought on the East Jerusalem front, adding that many of his comrades died during the fighting in 1967. ""I arrived at the Al-Mughrabi Gate (in the western corridor of Al-Aqsa Mosque)…and when I looked at the left side, I found a key. I don't know why I put my hand on it and took it,"" he said. ""I put the key in my pocket, and since then, I've had it in my possession,"" he added.

I returned the key that I had stolen. I returned it back to its owners…and this is what Israel should do — to return back to the Palestinians their land, rights, respect, independence, freedom and security,"" he said. He said that after returning the key, he felt he ""did the right thing."" His handing back of the key came as Israeli settlers along with scores of Israeli officials joined a ""flag march"" to celebrate their occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967. Commenting on the controversial march, he said this is one of the worst days in the year for him, adding he stopped celebrating ""flag day"" a long time ago. The Flag March is staged by Israeli settlers every year to mark what they call the unification of Jerusalem, in reference to Israel's occupation of the city in 1967. ""I was part of it at that day. I wished I didn't do it, which is occupying Jerusalem,"" he said. Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.

Palestine warns of 'religious war' after Israeli minister's visit to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa,Unknown,"May 21, 2023 at 1:32 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Palestinian Authority (PA) on Sunday strongly condemned Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in occupied East Jerusalem, Anadolu reports. The far-right minister had forced his way into the flashpoint site early Sunday under Israeli police protection. ""Any harm to Al-Aqsa Mosque is playing with fire and will drag the region into a religious war with undesirable consequences that will affect everyone,"" PA spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in a statement. He stressed that such acts ""will not impose Israeli sovereignty over the site."" The Palestinian spokesman appealed for immediate action from the US and the international community to maintain the status quo at the Al-Aqsa complex. The status quo allows Muslims to worship at the Al-Aqsa compound and followers of other religions to visit the site. Since 2003, Israel has allowed settlers into the compound almost on a daily basis with the exception of Fridays and Saturdays. For Muslims, Al-Aqsa represents Islam's third-holiest site. Jews call the area the Temple Mount, saying it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times. Israel occupied East Jerusalem, where Al-Aqsa is located, during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.

MEMO launches Engaging the World: The Making of Hamas' Foreign Policy in Portuguese,Unknown,"May 20, 2023 at 4:05 pm",Asia & Americas+Brazil+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"Researcher, writer and Middle East Monitor Director, Dr. Daud Abdullah, launched the Portuguese edition of his book Engaging the World: The Making of Hamas' Foreign Policy, in Brazil this week. The book, published originally in English, tackles the Western media's narrative about the Palestinian resistance with information obtained from in-depth research and interviews with members and leaders of the Hamas movement. In week-long events organised to launch the book, Abdullah took part in activities at the Islamic Cultural Center of Bahia on 15 May as part of Nakba commemoration events. He went on to visit the cities of Cachoeira and Santo Amaro, including the local quilombo — communities of survivors of former concentrations of fugitive or freed slaves. Abdullah met with scholars at the Federal University of Reconcavo Baiano and lectured at the Federal University of Bahia. Abdullah's work brings to the fore an unknown aspect of the Palestinian resistance; its exchanges with global governments, authorities and public leaders. The Portuguese edition of the book is prefaced by former Foreign Minister and current Special Adviser to the Presidency of the Republic of Brazil in Lula's administration, Celso Amorim, and Professor of Arab History and Palestine History at the Department of Oriental Literature at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), Arlene Clemesha, in addition to prominent intellectual Dr Ilan Pappe.

As a result, the entire fleet is due to be replaced. The first batch of advanced copies will arrive in Israel in 2026 to replace the old aircraft.

Mufid shared that he received a response from Oxford University, in which they informed him that they would amend the posters and no reference would be made to the establishment of the State of Israel in the project.

QNA noted that Sheikh Tamim sent a message to Saudi Arabia's King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, expressing: ""His deep thanks and appreciation for the hospitality that His Highness and the accompanying delegation received during his participation in the 32nd regular session of the Arab League Council at the summit level."" The emir of Qatar had arrived in Jeddah to participate in the work of the Arab Summit, received by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and was present when the photo of attendees was taken. However, the emir of Qatar did not appear at the presidents' plenary session and left early, according to a report by the Qatari Emiri Diwan. An Arab official told Reuters on Friday that the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani: ""Did not hold any bilateral meetings or give a speech at the Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia's city of Jeddah, and his attendance was a courtesy visit."" The official added that the emir left the summit before Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad made his speech. The Syrian regime's news agency SANA disclosed that a handshake occurred between Al-Assad and the emir of Qatar during the summit in Jeddah. SANA also noted that a side conversation took place between the two presidents; however, it did not publish photos of the handshake in light of Qatar's position rejecting Damascus' return to the Arab League.

Syrians in exile say Arab normalisation with Assad audacious but not surprising,Unknown,"May 19, 2023 at 8:19 pm",Middle East+News+Syria,"As Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad addressed Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia on Friday, a group of Syrian refugees was in Germany learning to use international law to prosecute war criminals – which they hoped to apply to him some day, Reuters reports. ""Every Syrian who suffered from this regime could represent a lawsuit and we will file these lawsuits. Even if the whole world stands with him, we will bring him to justice,"" said Houaida Muhi Aldeen, a 49-year-old Syrian living in France and a former political detainee in Syrian prisons. Muhi Aldeen and other workshop attendants are among millions of Syrians displaced by the 12-year war. They found Assad's reintegration into the Arab League after more than a decade of isolation frustrating, but not surprising. ""This is the goal of this (normalisation) step, to sow despair and frustration among Syrians,"" said Anwar Al-Bunni, a lawyer helping prosecute Syrians suspected of war crimes in Germany. Al-Bunni said the poor human rights and democracy records of Arab leaders made Assad's return par for the course and that Gulf support for rebels ultimately played into Assad's hands by radicalising opposition groups that, in turn, suppressed democratic activism within their own ranks. As the 2011 Syrian uprising shifted towards armed insurgency and, later, a civil war, Qatar and Saudi Arabia were major sponsors of that insurgency, arming an array of groups that were fighting to topple the Iran-backed President. The 12-year-long war killed over 350,000 Syrians and forced more than 14 million to flee their homes, of which almost a million sought refuge in Europe. Arab normalisation with Assad would make it more difficult for Syrian refugees to return, said Muhi Aldeen. Her husband disappeared at the hands of the government in 2014, she said. ""I would say two words, which we took as an oath: We would die rather than being ruled by Al-Assad and we won't return as long as Al-Assad is there,"" Muhi Aldeen said. For Akil Hosain, 39, a Syrian journalist in France, the Arab League is a symbol of the pre-Arab Spring era; therefore, Assad's re-admittance comes as no surprise. ""Our surprise was that this step came in a very bold way, on the verge of audacious, if we could say,"" Hosain said. But a warming Arab leadership to the Syrian President does not concern many Syrians in Europe of a similar rapprochement from the West as there are legal obstacles, lawyer Al-Bunni said. ""For Europe … charging Al-Assad and 60 people of his retinue for committing crimes against humanity … is a legal obstacle, not just political, against rehabilitating criminals,"" he added. Last year, under the principle of universal jurisdiction that allows for the crimes to be addressed legally in some third-party states, a German court jailed after a trial a Syrian ex-intelligence officer for life for crimes against humanity, handing down the first conviction for state-backed torture committed during Syria's civil war.

"Ukraine Zelenskiy visits Saudi, seeks Arab League support for his people",Unknown,"May 19, 2023 at 7:50 pm",Arab League+Europe & Russia+International Organisations+Middle East+News+Russia+Saudi Arabia+Ukraine,"Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, attended a Summit of the Arab League in Saudi Arabia on Friday to canvas support for his people, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman expressed his readiness to mediate in the war between Moscow and Kyiv, Reuters reports. Also at the Jeddah gathering, Arab leaders warmly welcomed back into their fold Syria's President, Bashar Al-Assad – who has received heavy support from Russia in his country's civil war – following a decade of isolation. ""We reaffirm the Kingdom's readiness to continue mediating efforts between Russia and Ukraine, and to support all international efforts aimed at resolving the crisis politically in a way that contributes to achieving security,"" the Saudi Crown Prince said in his opening speech. Prince Mohammed has mediated in the conflict before. Zelenskiy, who was also due to attend a summit of the G7 leaders in the Japanese city of Hiroshima this weekend, thanked Saudi Arabia for its past help and said delegates would each receive the text of his 10-point peace plan. He asked them to work with Ukraine directly without intermediaries. Gulf States have tried to remain neutral in the Ukraine conflict, despite Western pressure on Gulf oil producers to help isolate Russia, a fellow OPEC+ member. In his address to the Summit, Zelenskiy said some countries, including members of the Arab League, preferred to ""turn a blind eye"" to Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian land and to its jailing of some Ukrainians during the 15-month war. ""I am sure we can all be united in saving people from the cages of Russian prisons,"" he said, speaking in English. Last year, in a diplomatic coup, Crown Prince Mohammed secured the release of 10 foreigners captured by Russia in Ukraine. The move was apparently made possible by his close ties with Russian President, Vladimir Putin. ""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia plays a significant role and we are ready to take our cooperation to a new level,"" Zelenskiy said wrote on Twitter shortly after arriving in Jeddah. Saudi Arabia faced heavy criticism from the United States over an OPEC+ decision to cut oil production, seen as helping Russia to refill its coffers by boosting prices. Even though the October decision initially drew the ire of the United States and other Western countries, market dynamics since then have shown the cuts to be prudent. At a time when Russia's war on the Ukraine has roiled global energy markets, the role the Kingdom plays as the world's largest oil exporter has grown in importance to both Washington and Moscow.

Lebanon receives Interpol red notice for Central Bank Governor - Minister,Unknown,"May 19, 2023 at 7:47 pm",Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon has received an Interpol notice issued for its Central Bank Governor, Riad Salameh, the country's caretaker Interior Minister, Bassam Mawlawi, told Reuters on Friday, saying he would implement it if the judiciary instructed him to do so, Reuters reports. The notice was issued after France put out its own arrest warrant for Salameh as part of its investigation into whether the Governor embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds, an accusation he denies. It is the first known warrant issued in connection with any of the five foreign investigations being carried out into the 72-year-old Lebanese Central Bank Governor. Mawlawi said the Interpol red notice had been issued on Wednesday and that he had informed Lebanon's judiciary the following morning. ""Whatever the judiciary says, we will do,"" Mawlawi said. He added that he believed it was ""necessary"" for Salameh to resign. Lebanon's deputy Prime Minister called on the Governor to step down on Thursday. Both said the issue was to be discussed at a consultative cabinet meeting on Monday, but was already part of talks among the country's senior leaders. ""It's being seriously discussed,"" Mawlawi said. Once a regular at banking summits and high-class restaurants in Europe, Salameh is now rarely seen in public, except for semi-regular television interviews defending his record. He has long retained the support of key players in Lebanon's political class, but with two top officials now saying he should resign, it appears that support is beginning to fray more rapidly. His departure would mark a milestone in Lebanon's financial meltdown which resulted from decades of profligate spending, corruption and unsustainable financial policies by leaders who have left the crisis to fester since 2019.

"From joy to dismay, Syrians split over Assad's Arab League return",Unknown,"May 19, 2023 at 7:45 pm",Arab League+Middle East+News+Saudi Arabia+Syria,"As some Syrians welcomed President Bashar Al-Assad's return to the Arab League on Friday, others expressed dismay that Arab States had welcomed back a leader they blame for death and destruction during 12 years of brutal civil war, Reuters reports. The diverging views reflect deep splits in a nation shattered by the conflict that has killed more than 350,000 people, with swathes of territory still held by rebels opposed to Assad, even as Arab states bring him in from the cold. ""I am happy to see such meetings restarting between Arab leaders, and I hope they will be useful for the Arab world and for Syria, specifically,"" said Naim Ibrahim, speaking in Damascus, Assad's seat of power. But in the rebel-held north, a refuge for Syrians who fled Assad's rule from all over Syria, Abu Ahmad Maasaran said Arab States had welcomed back a ""terrorist"" who had used all kinds of weapons to destroy homes and force people to flee. ""What kind of Arab countries put their hands in his? His hand is dirty, how do you dirty your hands?"" he said, speaking at a camp for displaced Syrians in the north-western town of Atmeh near the Turkish border. Arab States, including Saudi Arabia – the host of Friday's Summit – once backed rebels fighting Assad but have gradually changed policy towards the country, where the government beat back rebels with fire power from Russia and Iran. Though the main frontlines have been largely frozen for years, humanitarian needs are at a record high, with 14.6 million in need of aid last year, before the scale of the crisis was exacerbated by an earthquake in February. In Damascus, university student, Wael Hmeideh, said he hoped Syria's return to the Arab League would be good for the country. ""We hope the return of Syria to the Arab League, or the return of Arabs to Syria, plays a role to solve the crisis and conflict in the country, and end the Syrian war,"" he said. But Mustafa Abu Khaled, speaking at the camp for displaced people in Atmeh, said Arab States had invited Assad to sit with them after his regime had ""killed a million children, a million fathers, a million young people"". ""Let him release our prisoners and return us to our homes before they think of returning (Assad to the Arab League) and reconcile with him,"" he said.

"Syria Assad shakes hands, kisses cheeks with one time foes at Arab League Summit",Unknown,"May 19, 2023 at 7:40 pm",Arab League+International Organisations+Middle East+News+Saudi Arabia+Syria,"Every handshake would count, and Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad had plenty of them at Friday's Arab League Summit – along with hugs and kisses – from his one time foes in the region, Reuters reports. As he strolled into the Summit venue in the Saudi city of Jeddah on Friday afternoon, a beaming Assad extended his arms to Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who grabbed them both and kissed Assad once on each cheek. It was a symbolic moment, sealing Assad's reintegration into the Arab fold after being suspended from the League and isolated by most of the region for over a decade over his crackdown on protests against him. Saudi Arabia came out strongly against Assad soon after Syria's crisis broke out in 2011 but has, more recently, changed tack along with many Arab countries represented at the summit – despite objections by the West and many Syrians who still see him as a war criminal. Syria FM: No differences with Arabs over issues related to Syria As Assad lined up for the League's family photograph, he shook hands with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi. The two leaders smiled, gestured with their hands and tilted their heads as they chatted. Assad then turned briefly to speak to Tunisian President, Kais Al-Saeid. Assad held bilateral talks with Saeid and the UAE's Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed on Friday – and is expected to have a sit-down with bin Salman. One after the other, Arab leaders welcomed Syria's return to the Arab League and during his own address, Assad repeatedly said that Syria belonged to the Arab world. But one key leader did not hear him speak: Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani who, in 2018, called the Syrian President a war criminal. Al-Thani left Jeddah after leading his country's delegation, according to a statement by Qatar's Emiri Diwan distributed to media as Assad was speaking, and did not make his own address. Syria's state news agency had reported that the Emir and Assad shook hands and spoke briefly on the sidelines before the Summit began – but there was no statement on Qatari media. An Arab official told Reuters that the Emir did not hold any bilateral meetings and left the Summit before Assad spoke.

Turkish-Jewish family in legal battle with Israel authorities over baby,Unknown,"May 19, 2023 at 3:58 pm",Asia & Americas+Brazil+Europe & Russia+Israel+Middle East+News+Turkey+US,"A Turkish-Jewish family in Israel has been fighting a legal battle to reunite with their baby who was taken away nine months ago by Israeli authorities over alleged child abuse, Anadolu News Agency reports. Father SG, who holds both Turkish and Israeli citizenship, and his Israeli-Brazilian wife, DG, 21, took their one-month-old baby last May to the Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in West Jerusalem for treatment of cerebral haemorrhage, the second-leading cause of stroke. After preliminary examination, hospital and welfare officials filed a police complaint against the parents suspecting the baby was subjected to ""excessive shaking or violence"". Hospital staff concluded in their tests that the baby did not have a genetic disease but he said abuse by parents. As a result, Israeli police detained the parents. READ: Flag March: Israeli government ministers take part in racist rally The father spent 10 days in prison and 20 under house arrest, while the mother was also given four days of house arrest. Family accuses hospital staff of negligence The family blamed hospital staff for negligence quoting numerous tests conducted in the US and Israel which concluded that cerebral haemorrhage in the baby was not a result of any parental abuse, but a congenital and rare disease. ""Normally, hospitals have to investigate whether anything of this kind is due to abuse, but they decided very quickly,"" YG, the grandmother of the infant, told Anadolu. ""At the first stage, they diagnosed the baby with 'shaken baby syndrome' without necessary tomography scan and reported it to the police on suspicion of abuse,"" she added. Shaken Baby Syndrome is a condition that occurs from violently shaking an infant by the shoulders, arms or legs. It may cause serious health issues such as intracranial haemorrhage and brain damage in the baby. She went on to say that every parent can be doubted, ""but it is unacceptable to make this diagnosis without a tomography"". The family submitted the test results by US and Israeli laboratories to the court last November. On 6 December, the judge decided to give the baby to the grandmother, ruling that the mother could stay with the baby. According to the baby's grandmother, the judge wanted to give the baby to the parents, but the Social Services objected to the court's decision. Finally, after the case appeared in the local media two weeks ago, the court decided that the baby should stay with his mother's sister. Grieving parents The grieving father, SG, who was born and raised in Israel, told Anadolu, ""They take you and throw you in jail. Your baby is in the hospital and you don't know what happened to your baby. No one is telling you about your baby's condition. They just say, 'You did it, you're not a good father', they blame you. This is terrible …"" The father said the Israeli authorities made him take a lie detector test.

The grandmother and father stated that they would ""definitely"" file a compensation case against the Social Services officials after they got the baby back. The grieving mother said: ""We were very afraid that our baby would die. Then they came and began blaming us, saying that we did it. It was a horrible feeling."" Bursting into tears, she told Anadolu: ""(Hopefully) our baby will be with us as soon as possible. But every time our baby is not with us, every single day, she destroys us."" Regarding the family's address, the Hadassah Hospital and Welfare and Social Services Ministry told Anadolu the matter is sub-judice. Hadar Elboim, spokesperson for Hadassah, one of the largest university hospitals in Israel, said: ""A multi-disciplinary child protection team works within the hospital, which investigates cases where there is a suspicion of harming children and vulnerable individuals."" The spokesperson of the Welfare and Social Services Ministry declined to comment. Verda Steinberg, the family's lawyer, told Anadolu that the case will be heard again at the end of this month. Steinberg pointed out that, this time, the hearing will be held with the participation of doctors for the first time, saying that it is in favour of the family. The Social Services Institution has done an indescribable injustice to the family, Steinberg added. Meanwhile, the Work, Welfare and Health Commission in the Israeli Parliament gathered the parties involved in the case to discuss the issue. The majority of the deputies and attending the meeting took the side of the family, stressing that all available findings prove the baby has a genetic disease. Also, friends and relatives of the family gathered in front of the Knesset, Israeli parliament, to hold a demonstration.​ READ: Israel army captain arrested on charges of raping female officer   This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

The officer, whose name has not been made public, will remain in custody until Tuesday when an investigation will confirm if he is suspected of ""serious sex offences."" The Israeli female officer, who filed a complaint with the Military Police, said the sexual abuse took place several months ago, during a trip with officers of the unit. According to the latest report by the Association of Rape Crisis Centres in Israel (ARCCI), published last year, there were 4,521 sexual offence and sexual harassment cases investigated by the prosecutor's office in 2020. However, in 2021, the figure was down to 4,218. Similarly, the report noted a lower number of indictments being filed for sexual offences in 2021, down to 717 from 744 in 2020. Moreover, just under 90 per cent of sexual offence cases involving Israeli army officers were opened but later closed without charge. The occupation army reported an 82 per cent increase in complaints about sexual offences since 2016. ""Israeli society is a society bathed in sexual violence, and women pay a difficult and heavy price for it,"" ARCCI Executive Director Orit Sulitzeanu told the Jerusalem Post. ""One of the reasons for this is the fact that in Israel, many organisations derive organisational norms from the military, which is a hierarchical, masculine and, of course, militaristic organisation.""

New York representative introduces bill to ban funding for illegal Israeli settlements,Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 10:11 pm",Asia & Americas+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+US,"Legislation has been put forward at New York's state assembly which would prevent registered charities from sending tens of millions of dollars per year to help fund illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and Palestinian Territories. Zohran Mamdani, a member of News York's state assembly, this week introduced the bill titled 'Not on our dime!: Ending New York funding of Israeli settler violence', which aims to prohibit tax-deductible donations from being used to fund illegal Israeli settlements and expel Palestinians from their native land. Speaking to the Guardian newspaper, Mamdani stated that ""This legislation makes it clear that New York will no longer effectively subsidise war crimes and the flouting of international law"", referring to the fact that the building of Jewish-only and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal under international law. ""What we have is a number of New York state-registered charities that are sending at least $60m a year to Israeli settlement organisations which then use that funding to continue the history of expulsion and dispossession of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories that has been going on for decades,"" he said. Mamdani identified some of those organisations and charities based in New York as including the Central Fund of Israel, which claims to promote ""charitable causes in Israel"" and fund the entire ""land of Israel"" – a term Zionists use to refer to not only the Israeli state, but also the Occupied Palestinian Territories. An entire network of settler organisations reportedly benefits from donations distributed by the CFI, such as the Israel Land Fund which is responsible for the expulsion of Palestinian families from their homes in order to accommodate new Jewish settlers. READ: Israel announces plans for hundreds of new settlement units The state assembly member also named the Friends of Ir David, another US-based group which funds Elad, an Israeli settler organisation responsible for the forced removal of Palestinians as it seeks to ""Judaise"" occupied East Jerusalem. ""These organisations masquerade as charities while funding illegal activities,"" Mamdani said. He emphasised the necessity of introducing legislation explicitly and directly targeting funding to Israel and its settlements, saying that other laws that should target them are disregarded by those organisations and ignored by Washington due to the predominant position of supporting Israel within US politics. ""There's a phrase that I grew up hearing: PEP, progressive except Palestine,"" Mamdani recalled. ""You'd see how, time and again, how politicians who espoused universal beliefs would always seem to find an exception when it came to the question of Israel and Palestine. We see that sadly in terms of how our laws are applied in terms of how our policies are applied. What this legislation does is it reckons with reality."" If it is passed, the proposed legislation would essentially grant New York State's Attorney General the power to sue those groups funding the illegal settlements, and would also provide the right to seek damages in American courts to Palestinians who are harmed by settler organisations funded by those 'charities'. ""I think it will be a long fight. I do not have any illusions"", Mamdani said, acknowledging it may not be passed this time. ""But if you look at the attitudes of Americans towards Palestine and towards Israel, and specifically to the question of settlements, it is very clear that this is also a fight that is broadly popular."" In response to the bill, 25 pro-Israel lawmakers this week sent out a joint letter condemning it, claiming that it would only serve to punish Jewish organisations that provide aid to the poor, as well as emergency care for victims of terrorism. ""This bill is a ploy to demonise Jewish charities with connections to Israel. It was only introduced to antagonise pro-Israel New Yorkers and further sow divisions within the Democratic Party,"" they stated.

Qatar takes diplomatic back seat as Saudi flexes political muscle,Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 10:00 pm",Africa+Arab League+Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Egypt+International Organisations+Libya+Middle East+News+Qatar+Saudi Arabia+Sudan+Syria+UAE+US+Yemen,"The Arab League's welcoming back of Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad into its ranks highlights how far behind Qatar has fallen in its bid to be a diplomatic voice that carries weight in the Middle East. Earlier this month, Qatar reluctantly withdrew its opposition to Saudi Arabia's initiative to re-admit Syria. It made clear it opposed normalising its own ties with Damascus, but said it would not stand in the way of an Arab consensus. The dismay in the diplomatic mission in Doha of a Syrian opposition group, which Qatar recognises as Syria's official embassy to the state, was a stark reminder of the shifting tides. ""Qatar did not accept this decision, but they did not stand in the way,"" Belal Tourkya, the mission's chargé d'affaires, told Reuters. Analysts say the change in Doha's position on Syria is a sign it may be dialling back on its once-ambitious regional foreign policy to avoid raising the ire of its most powerful neighbours. Assad is expected to attend the Arab League summit in Jeddah on Friday for the first time in 12 years, a powerful signal his regional isolation over Syria's civil war is ending. Saudi Arabia used its leverage over Arab League members to push them to return Syria to the body, said Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics. READ: Qatar may find itself isolated on Syria normalisation ""Qatar didn't want to play any obstructive role that would have risked angering the leadership in Riyadh and other Arab capitals,"" he said. Qatar has been steadily mending ties with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. In early 2021 they agreed to end a 3-1/2 year boycott of Qatar imposed over accusations that Doha supported terrorism – a broad allusion to Islamist movements. Qatar denies the charges. Qatar's backing of pro-democracy movements and rebels in Syria, and in other places like Egypt and Libya after the 2011 Arab Spring had infuriated its neighbours. Boosted by riches from gas, it has played an outsized role in global affairs. It hosts US troops, finances the influential Al-Jazeera news network, and mediates in conflicts. Last year's soccer World Cup was seen as a showcase of soft diplomacy. But in recent weeks, Qatar has had little say in peace talks between Yemen's Houthi movement and Saudi Arabia, or in seeking an end to fighting between rival military factions in Sudan. The Gulf state is prioritising a good working relationship with its neighbours, especially Saudi Arabia, said a Western diplomat in Doha, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""This makes them keen to avoid getting involved in regional confrontations and that is why they are less engaged in Yemen and Sudan than in former times,"" the diplomat said. Qatar says its foreign policy is ""staunchly independent"" and strives ""to build consensus in the (Gulf) and wider Arab region through constructive dialogue that does not compromise our foreign policy,"" a Qatari official told Reuters. ""For this reason, Qatar decided not to block Syria's re-admission to the Arab League but has not normalised relations with the Syrian regime,"" the official said. When Qatar authorised the opposition embassy in 2013, Doha was the lead architect of a growing Arab consensus that isolated Assad and boosted support for his foes. READ: TIMELINE – After years of war, Assad returns to Arab fold Doha and Washington worked together to try to organise an international anti-Assad effort and to develop an alternative to him, said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and director of the Centre for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. Qatar cast the Syrian National Coalition as a government-in-exile, handing them Syria's Arab League seat and opening the Doha mission in a villa nearby other embassies. Al-Jazeera beat ""the drums of regime change"" by broadcasting a stream of videos of Assad's security forces attacking protestors, Landis said. Several Gulf States including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates began backing rebel groups fighting to oust Assad from power. ""Qatar assumed that the civil war was going to result in an overthrow of the Assad dynasty, which it did not,"" said Mehran Kamrava, Professor of Government at Georgetown University Qatar. Assad regained control over much of Syria with the help of Iran and Russia, but hundreds of thousands of people died in the war, millions have fled the country and Syria remains splintered with its economy in ruins. As Syria's anti-Assad movement lost ground, ""Saudi Arabia and the UAE shifted their policy most dramatically, but Qatar has not,"" Kamrava said. Qatar initially opposed efforts this spring by Saudi Arabia to galvanise support to re-admit Syria to the Arab League following its 2011 suspension. ""They still see Assad as a war criminal and his place should be in the courts,"" Tourkya said. But, three weeks later, Qatar went along with the League's decision to re-admit Syria. The Foreign Ministry said it did not want to be an obstacle to Arab consensus. READ: US lawmakers to introduce bill to combat normalisation with Syria Assad Qatar made clear it would not be restoring relations with Assad's government, a move it says is linked to progress towards a political solution. But analysts question how long Doha can maintain that position. Qatar ""understands full well that they've lost, but it wants to be the last country to normalise with Syria,"" Landis said.

According to eyewitnesses cited by media reports, a large number of Israeli soldiers raided several districts of Nablus early this morning, breaking into and searching Palestinian homes. Protests then broke out between dozens of Palestinian youths and the Israeli troops, with the occupation forces firing bullets and tear gas as the Palestinians threw stones and glass bottles and closed off roads to prevent Israeli armoured vehicles from entering the city. There were also reportedly confrontations between Israeli forces and armed Palestinians.

Among those wounded was one Palestinian who sustained critical injuries from a gunshot wound in the back and seven others who were shot by rubber bullets, with 80 people reportedly also suffering from respiratory distress from the inhalation of tear gas. Palestinian security sources cited by media outlets said that, aside from the raid and searching of houses, Israeli forces shut down primary routes within the city in an effort to protect a group of Israeli settlers traveling to the site of Joseph's Tomb in the area surrounding Nablus. The incident came only days after the Palestinian Health Ministry revealed in a press release on Monday that the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of 2023 has, so far, reached 151.

Lebanon Central Bank boss urged to resign after French arrest warrant,Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 8:06 pm",Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister, Saadeh Al-Shami, called on Thursday for Central Bank Governor, Riad Salameh, to resign following France's issuing of an arrest warrant against him as part of a fraud investigation, Reuters reports. Salameh, his brother Raja and his assistant, Marianne Hoayek, are being investigated in Lebanon and at least five European countries on suspicion they may have taken more than $300 million from the Central Bank. ""In any country when someone is accused of such crimes, they should not remain in a position of responsibility and should recuse themselves immediately,"" Shami told Reuters. ""I think he should resign."" Salameh, who, along with his brother denies any wrongdoing, told Saudi-owned Al-Hadath TV on Thursday that he will step down if any court ruling goes against him. READ: Lebanon secures deals to get more Iraq oil He plans to appeal against the French warrant, which he told Al-Hadath violated principles of a Lebanese-French agreement without giving more details. ""The judicial pathway is unfair, but I am ready for it,"" he said. A Lebanese judge overseeing a local case against Salameh has rejected his lawyers' defence arguments, clearing the way for a 15 June hearing, a senior judicial source told Reuters. Critics had doubted the judiciary, where appointments largely depend on political support, would seriously investigate a figure of Salameh's stature, given his political connections. The Salameh brothers and Hoayek have been charged with fraud and embezzlement in two separate cases in Lebanon. Hoayek and her lawyer have not been reachable for comment. The judicial source told Reuters a new hearing date for Raja Salameh had also been set for 15 June. French prosecutors' warrant for Riad Salameh, issued on Tuesday, was the first from any of the foreign probes into him. Though some of his support bases in Lebanon and abroad are starting to fray, Salameh wants to end his 30-year tenure as bank head when his latest term expires in July. His departure would mark a milestone in the financial meltdown resulting from decades of profligate spending, corruption and unsustainable policies by Lebanon's leaders.

New Israel law to expel Arab students raising Palestine flag,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 1:15 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The extremist Israeli government is preparing a law to dismiss Israeli Arab students who raise the Palestine flag or express their support for Palestinian resistance inside universities, Israel Hayom revealed on Thursday. An extremist Israeli Mk from the far-right Otzma Yehudit Party is preparing the law, the Israeli newspaper disclosed, pointing out that the draft law is currently in its final stages. If an Arab student is charged with raising the Palestine flag or supporting the Palestinian resistance against the Israeli occupation, according to the law, they would be dismissed from their university. Meanwhile, the law calls for academic institutions to prevent the existence of student bodies that violate Israeli laws. According to the Israeli daily, heads of Israeli universities strongly criticised the law, stressing: ""It is problematic and dangerous."" Heads of Israeli universities expressed their hope that the education minister would undermine the law proposal at the Knesset's Legislative Committee. READ: Israel university authorities slam bill criminalising the Palestinian flag as 'fascist' They suggested that such a law aims to turn universities into arms for the Israeli police and intelligence services as they would be ordered to monitor thousands of students and punish them over issues protected under the freedom of expression laws. At the same time, the university heads indicated that such a law has consequences for the academic ties and status between Israeli universities and their international counterparts. In addition, it would lead to a wide-scale wave of academic boycotts of Israeli universities. Head of Tel Aviv University Ariel Porat responded to the law proposal: ""The Palestinian Authority is not a hostile state or a terrorist organisation. Raising its flag is protected under the freedom of expression law."" Porat added: ""If we applied this law, we would be likely obliged to have a large number of our students away from the university. They would not bear this suppression and would not hesitate to raise the PA flag."" The current Israeli government is the most extremist ever in Israel's history. Since its formation last year, it has introduced several apartheid laws affecting Arabs in Israel and the Palestinians and encouraged illegal settlement.

"Kuwait, Philippines crisis after workers' visa suspensions",Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 12:30 pm",Asia & Americas+Kuwait+Middle East+News+Philippines,"A new conflict has occurred between Kuwait and the Philippines over the protection of domestic workers and the rights of Kuwaiti employers after the Gulf state suspended visas for Filipino workers due to the ""wrong practices"" by the Philippines Embassy in the country. With about a quarter of a million Filipino workers in Kuwait, most of whom are domestic workers, the differences between the two countries are not new. There have been several rounds of talks in the past to reach understandings, but it seems they haven't reached a resolution that satisfies both parties. The suspension of visas comes after the Philippines stopped sending domestic workers to Kuwait in February for the first time after the body of Jullebee Ranara was found in the Kuwaiti desert in January. Large numbers of Filipino nationals work abroad, with about 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product coming from expat transfers. On Wednesday, Kuwait's Ministry of Interior confirmed in a statement that it had suspended visas for Filipino workers ""as a result of the wrong practices"" of the Philippines Embassy in Kuwait as well as the ""crimes"" committed by some members of the Filipino community against Kuwaitis. The statement indicated that the most prominent violation is the embassy's sheltering of Filipino workers in a centre for it, communicating with Kuwaiti citizens and summoning them without the permission of the Kuwaiti authorities, forcing travel agencies to search for runaway domestic workers and ""playing the role of state institutions"" and pressuring Kuwaiti employers to add contractual clauses against their will. The statement added that Kuwait stipulated during the talks the ""recognition and acknowledgement"" of the embassy of the Philippines that it had violated Kuwaiti laws and decisions and had breached diplomatic norms. It also asked that it promises not to repeat these acts. In return, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior will assess the situation and ensure that the embassy adheres to the conditions for at least three months: ""After which it decides what it deems appropriate."" READ: Kuwait to continue ban on visas for Philippines workers after talks fail to resolve labour dispute The statement said that the Philippine side rejected these conditions and, therefore, the Ministry of Interior: ""Adheres to its position rejecting any violations of the state's sovereignty and the dignity of its citizens and continues its decision to suspend all types of visas for the Filipino community until further notice,"" while continuing to renew the residency of those who have a valid residency. A crisis between the two countries ended more than five years ago with the Philippine side's apology in 2018 for what Kuwait considered a violation of its sovereignty after the Philippines Embassy in Kuwait ""rescued"" a number of Filipinos working in homes amid reports of violations. The Philippine Foreign Minister said at the time that the embassy had to ""help"" Filipino workers who sought help because some situations were considered a matter of life or death, stressing respect for Kuwait's sovereignty and laws: ""But the interest of Filipino workers is also very important."" The Philippine side did not comment on the Kuwaiti statement. However, after the two sides' talks last week, the Philippine Foreign Ministry shared that its delegation affirmed its ""full respect for Kuwaiti laws."" The statement on 18 May conveyed the measures taken by the Embassy and Government of the Philippines regarding the services provided to the migrant workers: ""Are solely to ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens."" The Philippines' Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega remarked in press statements last week that Kuwait's suspension of entry visas for Filipinos came in response to Manila's suspension of sending new domestic workers to the Gulf country in February, and that the Kuwaiti decision aims to pressure his country to lift this ban. De Vega noted that Kuwait is concerned about two issues and considers them a violation of its laws, namely the establishment of a shelter for runaway domestic workers and communicating with Kuwaiti employers regarding reports of violations. He added: ""Providing protection to a country's citizens abroad is a well-established duty of consular offices under international law and convention,"" adding that they do not encourage them to run away from their employers, but in the case of abuse, they should have a place to go to.

READ: Algeria: Controversy over Emir Abdelkader statue Al-Quds Al-Arabi researcher and political activist Hassan Zarkouni criticised Touahria's statement: ""How will Algeria coordinate with Italy to maintain stability in Tunisia? Will this be done through the GALSI project for gas transportation, which ignores Tunisian territory, knowing that nearly 55 per cent of the gas in Tunisia comes from Algeria and that 98 per cent of electricity is gas-generated? Or will it be through allowing the pollution of the Mjerdah Basin with industrial and urban waste? Or by misusing the shared groundwater resources between the Algerian Souf Valley and the Tunisian Ghardimaou region, which goes against our bilateral agreements and treaties?""

Reporters Without Borders calls for Egypt to release Tawfik Ghanem,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 10:37 am",Africa+Egypt+International Organisations+News+Reporters Without Borders (RSF)+UN,"Reporters Without Borders has called on the Egyptian authorities to release Tawfik Ghanem, the former bureau chief of the Anadolu Agency office in Cairo, noting that he had begun his third year in detention without being brought to trial. The organisation stated on its website, signed by the head of its Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, that imprisonment without trial is a common practice in Egypt, where 12 of the 20 imprisoned journalists are being held in pre-trial detention. The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt."" Ghanem has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years, as his provisional detention has been renewed every 15 to 45 days since 26 May, 2021. READ: UN: Malnutrition risk for half a million Yemen children Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Egyptian code of criminal procedure has a two-year limit on pre-trial detention, regardless of the charges. However, Ghanem is still being detained and deprived of medical care. He is 69 years old and suffers from serious health problems, including being diabetic. The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours. The authorities promised to do this but never fulfilled their promise. ""The Egyptian authorities must stop using provisional detention as a punitive tool against journalists. Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. It has made little progress on reforms required by the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol Red Notice.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

"Brazil´s president: The UN was so strong enough to create Israel, but now can't create a Palestinian state",Unknown,"April 28, 2023 at 11:43 am",Africa+Asia & Americas+Brazil+Egypt+Europe & Russia+France+Germany+India+International Organisations+Iraq+Israel+Japan+Libya+Middle East+News+Nigeria+Palestine+South Africa+Spain+UK+UN+US,"Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva this week slammed the UN's inability to create a Palestinian State in the same manner that it established the state of Israel in 1948. ""The UN was so strong that, in 1948, it managed to create the State of Israel. In 2023, it fails to create a Palestinian state,"" Lula said. Speaking during an official visit to Spain, Lula continued: ""We live in the world where the UN Security Council, the permanent members, they are the ones who sell the most weapons in the world, they are the biggest participants in wars in the world."" ""When the United States invaded Iraq, there was no discussion in the Security Council. When France and England invaded Libya and when Russia invaded Ukraine, there was no discussion either,"" he added. Astonished by the reduced role non-member states play in the international organisation, he asked the UN Security Council not to limit itself to its permanent members. ""I am therefore left wondering whether it is up to us, other countries that are not permanent [members] of the UN Security Council, to make a change. Why aren't Brazil, Spain, Japan, Germany, India, Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa [ permanent members]? The winners of the Second World War currently determine that, but the world has changed."" ""We need to build a new international mechanism that does things differently. I think it's time for us to start changing things and it's time for us to create a G20 of Peace, which should be the UN,"" he said. His calls were slammed by the pro-Israel group, StandWithUs Brasil, who said: ""Contrary to what the president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said, Israel was not created by the United Nations. In 1947, what the UN Partition advocated was the creation of two countries, one for Jews and the other for Arabs. The Jews accepted; the Arabs did not."" ""The State of Israel was founded after a war waged by the armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq against the Jews."" ""As for a State for Palestinians, neither the UN nor other international organisations currently have the role of creating it, unless Palestinians and Israelis themselves come to seal the peace independently,"" the statement added.

An increase in police presence on the streets and main thoroughfares was also seen as leaders of the 22-member League started arriving in the modern commercial hub. An official from the Saudi Media Ministry told Anadolu that the traffic problems were caused due to extensive security measures put in place to ensure the safety of the leaders.

Israel advances bill imposing one-year imprisonment on people waving Palestinian flag,Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 5:03 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Knesset (Israel's parliament) has advanced a bill at a preliminary reading that would ban flying the Palestinian flag during protests. The proposal for the law, put forward by the far-right Otzma Yehudit party led by Almog Cohen, stipulates that three or more people waving the flag of a ""hostile entity"" will be considered a crime and, therefore, punishable by up to one year in prison. According to Haaretz, the bill, which requires three additional votes to pass, will also enable Israel authorities to criminalise and disband protests held by Palestinians. The description of the bill states that it ""directs the public behaviour in Israel. As a democracy, Israel enables its citizens to protest decisions they don't agree with the authorities on. But the proposal draws a red line between legitimate protest and one in which there are flags of those who don't recognise the State of Israel, those who aren't friendly toward it or don't enable Israel to raise its flag in its territory."" READ: Israel settlers seize water well, damage crops near Hebron The bill comes after Israel's Knesset (parliament) passed the preliminary reading of a controversial bill last year that would ban flying the Palestinian flag in state-funded institutions. It also comes as Israeli settlers stage the flag march through Jerusalem's Old City today to mark what they call the unification of Jerusalem, in reference to Israel's occupation of the city in 1967. Condemning the passing of the bill, the Legal Centre for Arab Minority Rights in Israel – Adalah, said police officers removing flags at protests and arresting those holding them is an ""extreme breach of their authority and the law"". Meanwhile, Hamas, the group that governs the Gaza Strip, slammed the bill as a religious war waged by the sitting fascist Israeli administration against Palestinians. ""Approving such a draft bill in a preliminary reading would give Israeli occupation forces the green light to further violate Palestinian people's rights,"" it said in a statement yesterday. The Resistance movement further highlighted that such actions would fail to discourage Palestinians from waving their national flag, which represents their identity, unity and struggle.

Coffee shop owner in Gaza turns coffee grounds into natural fertiliser,Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 5:01 pm",Middle East+News+Palestine,"As part of an environmentally friendly initiative, a coffee shop owner in the Palestinian Gaza Strip began recycling coffee grounds into organic fertiliser, Anadolu News Agency reports. Coffee grounds provide longer sustainability to plants and soil compared to chemical fertilisers. The coffee shop, with its two branches in the Rimal neighbourhood in the centre of Gaza City, produces over 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of fertiliser daily. According to data from the National Economy Ministry, the Gaza Strip consumes around 6-7 tons of coffee per day, at a rate of 2,500 tons annually. Sameh Habib, the owner of the cafe, noticed that most of the cafes in his residential area in a city in Europe began recycling organic wastes and using them as agricultural fertilisers, especially with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Abdullah Al-Safadi, 32, the coffee shop's Executive Director, said: ""The conversion of coffee grounds into compost has spread and become a public feature abroad, so we took the initiative to implement it in Gaza to preserve the environment."" READ: Gaza artist makes zoom drawing for Nakba 75 ""The cafe staff began collecting information about the conversion process, consulting agricultural engineers, and conducting a chemical study of the characteristics of coffee in government labs affiliated with the Agriculture Ministry in Gaza in November 2022,"" Al-Safadi told Anadolu. He explained that ""the results of the analysis showed that the acidity of coffee grounds was suitable for acidophilic plants."" ""We add certain amounts of industrial fertiliser or lime to supplement the organic fertiliser,"" he added. The Manager also said they conducted preliminary experiments with organic fertilisers on plants grown in plastic containers in the cafe. ""The experiments we conducted proved the efficacy of the substance in maintaining the vitality and recovery of the seedlings,"" Al-Safadi added. In addition to its use as fertiliser, scientific studies have shown that coffee grounds are one of the best natural materials that help freshen the skin. They are also sometimes used as a repellent to keep fungi and bacteria away from tomato plants, according to Al-Safadi. According to international media reports, European farms have resorted to using coffee grounds as a natural fertiliser, after the price of chemical fertilisers increased dramatically due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which stopped the export of fertilisers from both countries. Al-Safadi said the fertiliser produced from the grounds ""provides the soil with the most important nutrients of nitrogen and magnesium"". He affirmed that ""the compost helps germinate earthworms, which help in turning the soil and increasing its aeration"". READ: Gaza family with 5 disabled siblings homeless after Israel air strike Al-Safadi indicated that converting coffee grounds into fertiliser would keep the sewage networks free of large quantities of plankton that cause clogging, especially since the Gaza Strip produces large quantities of grounds daily, most of which goes into sewage networks. Al-Safadi said the cafe is trying to popularise the initiative by distributing organic fertiliser in the local community. He explained that a number of small cafes in Gaza began to contact them to benefit from their experience. Al-Safadi added that applying the experiment on a large scale would enhance access to a friendly and healthy environment.

"Israel cities end strike, turn to courts to block government's tax plan",Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 4:57 pm",Israel+Middle East+News,"Israel's municipalities, on Thursday, ended a three-day strike and said they would instead turn to the courts to try to block a government plan to reallocate their tax income, Reuters reports. The dispute is over a proposed fund that would dip into commercial property taxes collected by municipalities. The fund would then be distributed nationwide as an incentive to build more residential property. The government says it will help alleviate a housing shortage and lower costs that have soared over the past 15 years due to strong demand and limited supply. The city halls say it is an intrusion of federal authority, harms their local budgets, and is based on false Finance Ministry data. READ: Israel bans Muslims from Al-Aqsa ahead of racist Flag March in Jerusalem Many of the biggest and wealthiest cities in Israel went on strike on Monday, shutting schools for a day and suspending services such as trash collection, over the Finance Ministry's plan.

Explaining the change in tactics, the municipalities said they want to ""hurt the government, not the residents"". ""The fund does not achieve the goals for which it claims – addressing the housing crisis,"" the Federation said. ""Local governments … demand the state present a real plan to solve the housing crisis to bring down housing prices"" with incentives to expand housing starts. The fund is part of a law accompanying the 2023-2024 state budget that must be approved in parliament by 29 May. Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said on Monday that he would not give in and that the property tax fund would be passed.

Syria Assad to steal spotlight at Arab Summit after years in the cold,Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 4:46 pm",Africa+Arab League+Asia & Americas+China+Egypt+Europe & Russia+International Organisations+Kuwait+Lebanon+Libya+Middle East+News+Palestine+Qatar+Saudi Arabia+Sudan+Syria+Tunisia+Turkey+UAE+UN+US+Yemen,"Syrian President, Bashar Al-Assad, a pariah for more than a decade, is expected to steal the spotlight at Friday's Arab League Summit in Saudi Arabia, where he will rub shoulders with regional leaders who once backed his war foes, Reuters reports. Ostracised by most Arab states following his crackdown on protests against his rule in 2011 and the ensuing civil war, his government's return to the bloc is a signal that his war-battered country's isolation is ending. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others, for years, supported anti-Assad rebels. But Syria's army, backed by Iran, Russia and paramilitary groups, has regained control of most of the country. While Arab countries appear to have brought Assad in from the cold, they are still demanding that he curbs Syria's flourishing drugs trade and that war refugees can return. But it remains a striking recovery in the Syrian leader's fortunes. ""This is, indeed, a triumphant moment for Bashar Al-Assad, being accepted back into the Arab League, the Arab world, after being shunned and isolated by it for over a decade,"" said David Lesch, a Middle East History Professor at Trinity University in Texas. READ: Arab foreign ministers meet in Saudi Arabia ahead of annual summit Several states, including Qatar and Kuwait, had voiced their opposition to welcoming back Assad. But the Summit will underscore how Qatar has scaled back its ambitions to be a major diplomatic player in the region and accept Saudi's pre-eminent role. Assad is not the only divisive issue among Arabs. The League is also split over questions ranging from normalisation with Israel and how to support the Palestinian cause, the regional roles of Turkiye and Iran, and which side to pick in polarised global politics. Also present in the Red Sea city of Jeddah are envoys for Sudan's warring military factions. That ongoing conflict is expected to dominate discussions. Saudi Arabia has been hosting talks on a ceasefire and humanitarian issues in Sudan for weeks. The Kingdom wants to send a message to the global community that Arabs will work together, said Abdullah Baaboud, the State of Qatar Chair for Islamic Area Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. ""That also helps it (Riyadh), not only in term of its status within the Middle East, but also beyond that when it comes to dealing with international powers, whether it is the United States, Europe or China,"" Baaboud said. Washington has been sceptical about Assad's return to the Arab fold. A bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced a bill last week intended to bar US recognition of Assad as Syria's President and enhance Washington's ability to impose sanctions. His return to the Arab League is likely to revive questions over his human rights record. Government forces have used chemical weapons more than two dozen times during Syria's civil war, UN war crimes investigators said. Syria has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. But Assad has proven resilient, despite pressure from Western powers and Arab countries which backed his enemies in the war. The Syrian crisis and other regional conflicts, including Yemen and Libya, pose further challenges for the Arab League, which is often undermined by internal divisions. Arab leaders argue that security is more important than democracy. ""There has been, indeed, in the past few years a willingness by Saudi Arabia and other regional actors to consolidate a form of authoritarian stability in the region,"" said Joseph Daher, a Professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. ""Despite continuous rivalries among various states … they hold a common position in wanting to return to a situation similar to that in place before the uprisings in 2011."" This year's Summit also comes as Egypt, Tunisia and Lebanon struggle with runaway inflation, unemployment and popular anger. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, however, have set a new tone for times of crisis, saying the era of no-strings attached to help that the Gulf States offer others, is over.

President Marius Vizer was quoted by insidethegames as saying: ""The sanction for Iran will finish in September. They are welcome back."" ""I hope they do their best to respect the rules and do not repeat the past inconvenient incidents,"" he added. Vizer also said that ""It was a hard decision [to impose the suspension] and we regret that this has affected the athletes and the judo community in Iran. It's not their fault."" READ: Algeria judoka suspended for refusing to face Israeli opponent Iranian judokas will be open to participate again when the ban expires on 17 September as the ban was backdated to the start of 2019. The IRIJF was originally handed an ""indefinite"" ban after Saeid Mollaei was ordered to withdraw from the 2019 World Championships in Tokyo in order to avoid competing against an Israeli opponent. Iran was given the four-year suspension in 2021 over ""repeated and severe breaches"" of the IJF's statutes and the values of Olympism. An unsuccessful appeal was made to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) who ruled that the previous indefinite ban was not allowed but upheld the four-year suspension. Mollaei fled to Germany in 2019 and at the end of that year became a citizen of Mongolia representing the country at the 2020 Olympics. He dedicated his silver medal to Mongolia and Israel. The ban did not affect Iranian judokas going to the Olympics as the team is sent by the national Olympic body and not the IRIJF.

"Iran, Pakistan inaugurate joint border market, power transmission line",Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 1:48 pm",Asia & Americas+Iran+Middle East+News+Pakistan,"Iran and Pakistan, on Thursday, inaugurated a joint border market as well as an electricity transmission line in the presence of top government officials, Anadolu News Agency reports. The Mand-Pishin Border Sustenance Marketplace is one of six border markets planned for the two neighbouring countries' shared border, as agreed in a Memorandum of Understanding signed on 21 April, 2021. Pishin is a city in the Iranian province of Sistan-Baluchestan, and Mand is a town in Pakistan's southern Balochistan province, where the market opened on Thursday. The market was thrown open by Iran's President, Ebrahim Raisi, and Pakistan's Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif, in the presence of senior officials from both countries. The border market, which is set up on 10 acres (4 hectares) of land, is expected to bolster cross-border trade between the two countries and provide new opportunities for local businesses to flourish. READ: Egypt and Iran arrange new talks in Baghdad Raisi and Sharif also inaugurated the Polan-Gabd Electricity Transmission Line which is expected to carry an additional 100MW of electricity from Iran to Pakistan. This transmission line will supplement the electricity purchased from Iran for the border Makran region via the 132 KV Makran Division electricity transmission line. The additional 100 MW of electricity provided by Polan-Gabd will help to offset the energy needs of Balochistan's households and businesses. Polan is a town in Sistan-Baluchestan's port city of Chabahar, while Gabd is on the Pakistani side, 87 kilometres (54 miles) from Gwadar, a key route in the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. Last week, the two countries agreed to revive an ambitious gas pipeline project, expand bilateral trade, and collaborate in the field of aviation. The 2,275-kilometre (1,414-mile) Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project, which was first proposed in the 1990s to transport natural gas from Iran to Pakistan, has faced multiple delays due to US sanctions. Currently, bilateral trade between the two neighbours is less than $400 million. In September, 2020, former Prime Minister, Imran Khan, approved the establishment of 18 markets, six along the Iranian border and 12 along the Afghan border. On the sidelines of the joint inauguration, Raisi and Sharif held talks on bilateral issues and reaffirmed their commitment to boost economic cooperation between the two countries, officials said. A statement issued by the Iranian President's office on Thursday said the border market is an ""important development"" that can provide livelihood to thousands of border residents and help them ""improve their economic situation"". Later, at a joint press conference with Sharif following the inauguration, Raisi said the two countries are committed to strengthening bilateral ties and that the capacity exists to expand cooperation in the energy sector. He said more border markets are presently under construction in order to facilitate cross-border trade between the two countries and create job opportunities. Iran considers the border with Pakistan as an ""opportunity"" rather than a threat, he added. For his part, Sharif said the inauguration of the two projects marks a new chapter in the already growing trade and business relations between the two ""brotherly"" countries. He said Islamabad will negotiate the signing of a free-trade agreement with Tehran in order to increase bilateral trade and business. While inviting Raisi to visit Islamabad, Sharif said he has also spoken with the Iranian leader and ""made some proposals"" regarding Tehran's inclusion in the $64 billion dollar CPEC project.

Pakistan to be fined $18bn if it fails to complete Iran gas project,Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 1:27 pm",Asia & Americas+India+Iran+Middle East+News+Pakistan+US,"Pakistan faces a hefty $18 billion penalty if it fails to complete a gas pipeline project with Iran, Dawn has reported. Iran has already built its section of the pipeline, but Pakistan is yet to finish the one on its side of the border within the timeframe set out in the agreement. The 25-year deal to export Iran's natural gas through a pipeline to neighbouring Pakistan was signed between the two countries in 2009 and was supposed to be implemented by 2015. However, the project was stalled due to US sanctions against Tehran and pressure on Islamabad from Washington. According to a revised contract in September 2019, Iran agreed not to file a lawsuit if Pakistan completes the pipeline by March 2024. Noor Alam Khan, head of the transparency watchdog the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), was quoted by Dawn as saying: ""The US should pay the penalty if it does not approve of Pakistan and Iran going ahead with the gas pipeline project. The USA will have to do away with double standards — being lenient with India in meeting its energy needs while punishing Pakistan for the same."" The comments were in response to a letter sent by Pakistan's foreign ministry, following a meeting with PAC in March, who raised concerns over a possible fine. The ministry said: ""In view of great importance of the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project in the emerging regional situation, this ministry has been exploring all possible options, including close engagements and meaningful exchanges with relevant parties, including Iran and the USA."" ""Pakistan was committed to the Pak Stream Pipeline project. The two sides are negotiating outstanding issues,"" the ministry added.

"IMF: Jordan economy to grow 2.6% in 2023, but unemployment too high",Unknown,"May 18, 2023 at 1:24 pm",IMF+International Organisations+Jordan+Middle East+News,"An IMF team and the Jordanian government yesterday reached a staff-level agreement regarding the sixth review of the economic reform programme. The completion of this review will bring the total IMF disbursements since the start of the programme in 2020 to approximately $1,750 million. This agreement is subject to approval by the IMF's senior management and the Executive Board. The IMF mission's team visited Jordan from 3-17 May to carry out its sixth performance review, as part of the government's economic reform programme. Jordanian Finance Minister Mohamad Al-Ississ said, during a press conference at the conclusion of the sixth review yesterday, that the government and the IMF mission succeeded in reaching an agreement on the sixth review of the economic reform programme within the specified time. He added that this review is a cornerstone to confirm the resilience of the Jordanian economy, and the confidence of the international community and global international financial institutions in the stability of the Jordanian economy, supported by financial and monetary reforms. According to the Governor of the Central Bank, Adel Sharkas, Jordan's success in completing 6 reviews of economic reform with the IMF on time reflects Jordan's commitment to moving forward with qualitative and sustainable structural economic reforms, despite the challenges in the global environment. In turn, the head of the IMF mission to Jordan, Ron van Rooden, said that the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) ""has successfully maintained monetary and financial stability. It remains committed to the peg and has raised policy rates in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve."" Rooden expected the Jordanian economy to continue to grow this year by 2.6 per cent, noting that a growth rate between two and three per cent is not enough to improve the living conditions of the citizens. He added that the IMF views the unemployment rates in Jordan as still too high, especially amongst youth and women, and that this confirms the need to continue structural reforms. According to the World Bank, the unemployment rate reached 22.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 19.0 per cent during the same period in the fourth quarter of 2019, prior to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

Israeli 'flag march' in Jerusalem to fuel tension: Palestine,Unknown,"May 17, 2023 at 7:27 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The Palestinian Authority (PA) warned, Wednesday, that a planned flag march by Israeli settlers in occupied East Jerusalem will fuel tension in the region, Anadolu News Agency reports. Settlers plan to stage the flag march through Jerusalem's Old City on Thursday to mark what they call the unification of Jerusalem, in reference to Israel's occupation of the city in 1967. In a statement, PA spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, termed the flag march as ""provocative"", holding the Israeli government ""fully responsible for this escalation that will lead to an explosion in the situation"". ""Our Palestinian people and their leadership are capable of protecting Jerusalem and its Islamic and Christian holy sites and that Jerusalem will remain with its holy places the eternal capital of the State of Palestine,"" Abu Rudeineh said. The controversial march triggered violent clashes with Palestinians in recent years, including an 11-day fighting between Israel and Palestinian groups in Gaza in May 2021. Israeli settlers groups said they plan to mobilise nearly 5,000 settlers to break into the flashpoint Al-Aqsa Mosque complex on the day of the flag march. According to Israeli Channel 13, four Israeli ministers are scheduled to join the flag march, including far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich. For Muslims, Al-Aqsa represents the world's third-holiest site. Jews call the area the Temple Mount, saying it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times. Israel occupied East Jerusalem, where Al-Aqsa is located, during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. It annexed the entire city in 1980 in a move never recognised by the international community.

"At least 4.5m killed by wars after 9/11, new report finds",Unknown,"May 17, 2023 at 5:57 pm",Africa+Asia & Americas+Middle East+News+US,"Post-9/11 conflicts and invasions in the Middle East and other surrounding regions have directly and indirectly killed at least 4.5 million people over the past two decades, a new report has revealed. According to a research report from the Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson Institute, wars initiated by Western powers in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia are directly responsible for the deaths of at least between 4.5-4.6 million people. Following the attack on New York city's twin towers on 11 September 2001, the United States and coalition forces it led, invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban government that same year in retaliation, as it had maintained protection for Osama bin Laden, the Al-Qaeda leader who Western nations blamed for the attacks. In the following years, the US-led coalition forces also conducted further military action on countries in the Middle Eastern region, the most prominent of which was their invasion of Iraq in 2003. Other cases include strikes on targets within Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, as well as those not directly a consequence of the 'war on terror' such as Libya and Syria. Out of the estimated 4.5 million fatalities, the report showed, a vast majority were ""indirect"" deaths which numbered at least 3.6 to 3.7 million and were caused by a variety of factors. The categories cited in the report include economic collapse and food insecurity, public services and health infrastructure destruction, environmental contamination and reverberating trauma and violence. ""Indirect deaths are devastating, not least because so many of them could be prevented, were it not for war"", the report stated, adding that it is difficult to estimate indirect deaths due to them not immediately occurring during a conflict period or after battles. ""A death from hunger mostly occurs at some distance from this attention to spectacle and it may happen months or years after war disrupts access to food. Often, people affected by war are displaced and transient, making them hard to track."" OPINION: What's still wrong with the 'War on Terror'? It also acknowledged the difficulty in disentangling such indirect deaths by conflict factors from death that may have occurred without those factors, due to some crises already afflicting particular countries such as poverty or illness. Cost of War clarified in the document that ""In laying out how the post-9/11 wars have led to illness and indirect deaths, the report's goal is to build greater awareness of the fuller human costs of these wars and support calls for the United States and other governments to alleviate the ongoing losses and suffering of millions in current and former war zones."" An example of such a case that it cited is Afghanistan in the current day which, despite the withdrawal of US and coalition forces and the return of the Taliban government and relative stability, still sees many Afghans ""suffering and dying from war-related causes at higher rates than ever"". Using the Geneva Declaration Secretariat's average ratio of four indirect deaths for every one direct death, the report's researchers judged it to be accurate to arrive at the ""reasonable and conservative"" estimate of 4.5 to 4.6 million deaths. The report also highlighted that, in terms of military deaths, the vast majority of forces killed were locals, including over 177,000 Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Syrians who died as of 2019. As for American troops, the number was 7,000 alongside over 8,000 military contractors. The total number, calculated by Cost of War, far outnumbers previous estimates of the post-9/11 wars, such as the Physicians for Social Responsibility's estimate in 2015 that over one million people had been killed both directly and indirectly in the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan themselves.

Russia and Iran sign rail deal for corridor intended to rival Suez Canal,Unknown,"May 17, 2023 at 5:05 pm",Africa+Egypt+Europe & Russia+Iran+Middle East+News+Russia,"Russian President, Vladimir Putin, and his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, on Wednesday oversaw, via video-link, the signing of a deal to finance and build an Iranian railway line as part of an embryonic international North–South Transport Corridor, Reuters reports. The Rasht-Astara railway is seen as an important link in the corridor, intended to connect India, Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan and other countries via railways and sea – a route that Russia says can rival the Suez Canal as a major global trade route. ""The unique North-South transport artery, of which the Rasht-Astara railway will become a part, will help to significantly diversify global traffic flows,"" Putin said.

Russia and Iran have been pushed to strengthen their political and economic ties by Western economic sanctions on each, which both say are unjustified. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that swept US-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from power, Iran has been ostracised by the West and its economy crippled by a myriad of sanctions. It holds around a quarter of the Middle East's oil reserves. The West also imposed other set of restrictions over Iran's nuclear program, while Russia was sanctioned due to its actions in Ukraine.

Last month, bin Abdulrahman said that Qatar's boycott of the Syrian regime remains in place. Al-Assad is expected to attend the upcoming Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia on 19 May.

New Israel law to expel Arab students raising Palestine flag,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 1:15 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"The extremist Israeli government is preparing a law to dismiss Israeli Arab students who raise the Palestine flag or express their support for Palestinian resistance inside universities, Israel Hayom revealed on Thursday. An extremist Israeli Mk from the far-right Otzma Yehudit Party is preparing the law, the Israeli newspaper disclosed, pointing out that the draft law is currently in its final stages. If an Arab student is charged with raising the Palestine flag or supporting the Palestinian resistance against the Israeli occupation, according to the law, they would be dismissed from their university. Meanwhile, the law calls for academic institutions to prevent the existence of student bodies that violate Israeli laws. According to the Israeli daily, heads of Israeli universities strongly criticised the law, stressing: ""It is problematic and dangerous."" Heads of Israeli universities expressed their hope that the education minister would undermine the law proposal at the Knesset's Legislative Committee. READ: Israel university authorities slam bill criminalising the Palestinian flag as 'fascist' They suggested that such a law aims to turn universities into arms for the Israeli police and intelligence services as they would be ordered to monitor thousands of students and punish them over issues protected under the freedom of expression laws. At the same time, the university heads indicated that such a law has consequences for the academic ties and status between Israeli universities and their international counterparts. In addition, it would lead to a wide-scale wave of academic boycotts of Israeli universities. Head of Tel Aviv University Ariel Porat responded to the law proposal: ""The Palestinian Authority is not a hostile state or a terrorist organisation. Raising its flag is protected under the freedom of expression law."" Porat added: ""If we applied this law, we would be likely obliged to have a large number of our students away from the university. They would not bear this suppression and would not hesitate to raise the PA flag."" The current Israeli government is the most extremist ever in Israel's history.

"Kuwait, Philippines crisis after workers' visa suspensions",Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 12:30 pm",Asia & Americas+Kuwait+Middle East+News+Philippines,"A new conflict has occurred between Kuwait and the Philippines over the protection of domestic workers and the rights of Kuwaiti employers after the Gulf state suspended visas for Filipino workers due to the ""wrong practices"" by the Philippines Embassy in the country. With about a quarter of a million Filipino workers in Kuwait, most of whom are domestic workers, the differences between the two countries are not new. There have been several rounds of talks in the past to reach understandings, but it seems they haven't reached a resolution that satisfies both parties. The suspension of visas comes after the Philippines stopped sending domestic workers to Kuwait in February for the first time after the body of Jullebee Ranara was found in the Kuwaiti desert in January. Large numbers of Filipino nationals work abroad, with about 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product coming from expat transfers. On Wednesday, Kuwait's Ministry of Interior confirmed in a statement that it had suspended visas for Filipino workers ""as a result of the wrong practices"" of the Philippines Embassy in Kuwait as well as the ""crimes"" committed by some members of the Filipino community against Kuwaitis. The statement indicated that the most prominent violation is the embassy's sheltering of Filipino workers in a centre for it, communicating with Kuwaiti citizens and summoning them without the permission of the Kuwaiti authorities, forcing travel agencies to search for runaway domestic workers and ""playing the role of state institutions"" and pressuring Kuwaiti employers to add contractual clauses against their will. The statement added that Kuwait stipulated during the talks the ""recognition and acknowledgement"" of the embassy of the Philippines that it had violated Kuwaiti laws and decisions and had breached diplomatic norms. It also asked that it promises not to repeat these acts. In return, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior will assess the situation and ensure that the embassy adheres to the conditions for at least three months: ""After which it decides what it deems appropriate."" READ: Kuwait to continue ban on visas for Philippines workers after talks fail to resolve labour dispute The statement said that the Philippine side rejected these conditions and, therefore, the Ministry of Interior: ""Adheres to its position rejecting any violations of the state's sovereignty and the dignity of its citizens and continues its decision to suspend all types of visas for the Filipino community until further notice,"" while continuing to renew the residency of those who have a valid residency. A crisis between the two countries ended more than five years ago with the Philippine side's apology in 2018 for what Kuwait considered a violation of its sovereignty after the Philippines Embassy in Kuwait ""rescued"" a number of Filipinos working in homes amid reports of violations. The Philippine Foreign Minister said at the time that the embassy had to ""help"" Filipino workers who sought help because some situations were considered a matter of life or death, stressing respect for Kuwait's sovereignty and laws: ""But the interest of Filipino workers is also very important."" The Philippine side did not comment on the Kuwaiti statement. However, after the two sides' talks last week, the Philippine Foreign Ministry shared that its delegation affirmed its ""full respect for Kuwaiti laws."" The statement on 18 May conveyed the measures taken by the Embassy and Government of the Philippines regarding the services provided to the migrant workers: ""Are solely to ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens."" The Philippines' Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega remarked in press statements last week that Kuwait's suspension of entry visas for Filipinos came in response to Manila's suspension of sending new domestic workers to the Gulf country in February, and that the Kuwaiti decision aims to pressure his country to lift this ban. De Vega noted that Kuwait is concerned about two issues and considers them a violation of its laws, namely the establishment of a shelter for runaway domestic workers and communicating with Kuwaiti employers regarding reports of violations. He added: ""Providing protection to a country's citizens abroad is a well-established duty of consular offices under international law and convention,"" adding that they do not encourage them to run away from their employers, but in the case of abuse, they should have a place to go to.

Reporters Without Borders calls for Egypt to release Tawfik Ghanem,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 10:37 am",Africa+Egypt+International Organisations+News+Reporters Without Borders (RSF)+UN,"Reporters Without Borders has called on the Egyptian authorities to release Tawfik Ghanem, the former bureau chief of the Anadolu Agency office in Cairo, noting that he had begun his third year in detention without being brought to trial. The organisation stated on its website, signed by the head of its Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, that imprisonment without trial is a common practice in Egypt, where 12 of the 20 imprisoned journalists are being held in pre-trial detention. The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt."" Ghanem has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years, as his provisional detention has been renewed every 15 to 45 days since 26 May, 2021. READ: UN: Malnutrition risk for half a million Yemen children Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Egyptian code of criminal procedure has a two-year limit on pre-trial detention, regardless of the charges. However, Ghanem is still being detained and deprived of medical care. He is 69 years old and suffers from serious health problems, including being diabetic. The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours. The authorities promised to do this but never fulfilled their promise. ""The Egyptian authorities must stop using provisional detention as a punitive tool against journalists. Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

Erdogan, on Thursday, also noted that ""with the support of Qatar, the work to build houses in Syria, which can accommodate 1 million refugees, continues."" Wafaa Mustafa Hajjaj, a Syrian citizen who lives with her child and nephews in Azaz in the countryside of Aleppo, told Anadolu that she came to Turkiye for treatment after she lost her eyesight in an attack on her village. Hajjaj, who stayed in Turkiye for five years, pointed out that during each stay, Turkish people have always supported her and her family. Hajjaj noted that she voluntarily returned to Syria. An infographic titled ""Falling number of Syrians refugees going home from Jordan, Lebanon"" is created in Ankara, Turkiye on October 25, 2022 [Yılmaz Yücel/Anadolu Agency]0The Syrian citizen hailed the Turkish effort in preparing the infrastructure for the Syrian refugees' return.
""The camp where we reside has water and electricity, and the needs are met through solar energy,"" Hajjaj told Anadolu.
She stressed the safety of the area she currently resides, adding: ""I believe that the rest of the Syrian refugees will return to their homeland whenever security prevails.""
""These areas are now safe because of Turkiye's presence,"" she added.
Turkish Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu, on Wednesday attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the project, ""Voluntary, Safe, Honourable Return Project"" in the northern Syria district of Jarablus, where he said a total of 240,000 houses will be constructed at nine separate locations across the Idlib and Afrin regions in the next three years.
Since 2016, Turkiye has launched four successful anti-terror operations across its border in northern Syria to prevent the formation of a terror corridor and enable peaceful settlement by locals: Euphrates Shield (2016), Olive Branch (2018), Peace Spring (2019) and Spring Shield (2020).
Thanks to these operations, the pace of the return of Syrian refugees from Turkiye to their country has accelerated.
More than 3.7 million Syrians currently reside in Turkiye, making it the world's top refugee-hosting country.
Following the start of a civil war in Syria in 2011, Turkiye adopted an ""open-door"" policy for Syrians fleeing persecution and brutality.
Syria has been embroiled in a vicious civil war since early 2011, when the Bashar Al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and more than 10 million others displaced, according to UN estimates.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. It has made little progress on reforms required by the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol Red Notice.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

"Brazil´s president: The UN was so strong enough to create Israel, but now can't create a Palestinian state",Unknown,"April 28, 2023 at 11:43 am",Africa+Asia & Americas+Brazil+Egypt+Europe & Russia+France+Germany+India+International Organisations+Iraq+Israel+Japan+Libya+Middle East+News+Nigeria+Palestine+South Africa+Spain+UK+UN+US,"Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva this week slammed the UN's inability to create a Palestinian State in the same manner that it established the state of Israel in 1948. ""The UN was so strong that, in 1948, it managed to create the State of Israel. In 2023, it fails to create a Palestinian state,"" Lula said. Speaking during an official visit to Spain, Lula continued: ""We live in the world where the UN Security Council, the permanent members, they are the ones who sell the most weapons in the world, they are the biggest participants in wars in the world."" ""When the United States invaded Iraq, there was no discussion in the Security Council. When France and England invaded Libya and when Russia invaded Ukraine, there was no discussion either,"" he added. Astonished by the reduced role non-member states play in the international organisation, he asked the UN Security Council not to limit itself to its permanent members. ""I am therefore left wondering whether it is up to us, other countries that are not permanent [members] of the UN Security Council, to make a change. Why aren't Brazil, Spain, Japan, Germany, India, Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa [ permanent members]? The winners of the Second World War currently determine that, but the world has changed."" ""We need to build a new international mechanism that does things differently. I think it's time for us to start changing things and it's time for us to create a G20 of Peace, which should be the UN,"" he said. His calls were slammed by the pro-Israel group, StandWithUs Brasil, who said: ""Contrary to what the president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said, Israel was not created by the United Nations. In 1947, what the UN Partition advocated was the creation of two countries, one for Jews and the other for Arabs. The Jews accepted; the Arabs did not."" ""The State of Israel was founded after a war waged by the armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq against the Jews."" ""As for a State for Palestinians, neither the UN nor other international organisations currently have the role of creating it, unless Palestinians and Israelis themselves come to seal the peace independently,"" the statement added.

""The data on the city's poverty rate presents a worrying picture,"" the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research said in a report published on the 56th anniversary of Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem. In 2021, 125,900 families in Jerusalem (39 per cent) and 202,400 children, or half of the city's children, were living below the poverty line, the report said. ""The poverty rate in Jerusalem is significantly higher than the rate in Israel at large, where 21 per cent of the families and 28 per cent of the children were living below the poverty line,"" it said. The report found that the poverty rate reached 43 per cent among Jerusalem's Haredi population, a slightly higher figure than among Israel's Haredi population, which hit 40 per cent. ""Among Jerusalem's Arab population, 60 per cent were living below the poverty line, compared with 39 per cent among the Arab population in Israel at large,"" it said.

LNG Croatia said in a statement that the first shipment of Omani liquefied natural gas coming from the industrial complex in the Omani city of Qalhat is the 62nd among the shipments it has received since its operations began in January 2021. In November 2022, the Omani LNG company said that it successfully loaded the 3,000th shipment of LNG that was produced and shipped from its industrial complex in Qalhat, Sur. Shipments of Omani LNG from Qalhat have reached 22 countries since production operations began in April 2000. The Omani LNG company was able to produce 191.2 metric tonnes of LNG.

Illegal settlers and occupation forces dance in Joseph's Tomb,Unknown,"May 17, 2023 at 12:20 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+Videos & Photo Stories,"Six Palestinians were injured this morning when Israeli occupation forces attacked them with gunfire during a raid at the site of Joseph's Tomb, based in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus. Ahmad Jibril, the head of the Palestinian Red Crescent, told Wafa news agency, that a Palestinian was shot with a live bullet in the back and taken to the hospital, while five other victims who were hit with rubber bullets are being treated locally. He added that another Palestinian man was severely injured after a gas bomb hit him in the hand, while a woman suffered a head injury following a sound bomb attack. Both victims were rushed to hospital. Ahmad noted that 80 Palestinians, including two pregnant women, suffered from suffocation and were forced from their homes after inhaling tear gas fired by Israeli occupation forces during the raid. Meanwhile,illegal settlers raided Joseph's Tomb under the protection of occupation forces  and performed Talmudic rituals as well as to sing and dance. All settlements and settlers are illegal under international law. Nevertheless, according to official data, around 650,000 extremist Israeli Jewish settlers live in more than 130 settlements that have been built on Palestinian land since the occupation of the West Bank started in 1967. Joseph's Tomb is believed by Palestinians to be the burial site for local religious figure, Sheikh Yousef Dweikat, while Israelis believe it belongs to the Biblical Patriarch Joseph. There has been an increase in the number of Israeli raids across the occupied West Bank over the past few months, particularly in Nablus and Jenin, coupled with violence carried out by illegal settlers who have, at times, even turned against Israeli forces.

Most social media 'anti-Semitism' related to criticism of Israel,Unknown,"May 17, 2023 at 12:14 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"Most of the discourse on social media classified by pro-Israel and Zionist groups as ""anti-Semitism"" is related to criticism of Israel, the occupation state's Diaspora Affairs Ministry has revealed. Israel's Ynet News reported that as much as 68 per cent of all online incidents are classified by supporters of the apartheid state as the controversial category of ""new anti-Semitism"". Since its popularisation in the 1990s, the term ""new anti-Semitism"" has been the subject of much debate and controversy. Arguing that the term conflates criticism of Israel and the ideology of Zionism with anti-Jewish racism — which is accepted universally as prejudice, discrimination or hostility against individual Jews, Jewish communities or the Jewish religion — critics of Israel have pushed back against its adoption as a form of racism. The controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism is the latest attempt to formalise ""new anti-Semitism"" as the accepted definition of anti-Jewish racism. Seven of the eleven examples cited in the IHRA definition conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Jewish racism. Despite strong opposition, the IHRA has been placed at the centre of a regulatory framework, which critics say is not only an attack on free-speech but also shields Israel from criticism and accountability for its brutal military occupation and apartheid in Palestine. READ: Israel raids West Bank city to tear down poster of Palestinian martyr The adoption of the IHRA definition is seen widely as one the reasons for the spike in alleged anti-Semitism, a view that's supported by the findings revealed by Israel's Diaspora Affairs Ministry. According to Ynet News, the ministry revealed that anti-Semitic incidents worldwide have risen by 22 per cent in 2023, compared with the first few months of last year, and that there was a 48 per cent increase in those events involving violence. The ministry also said that so-called ""new anti-Semitism"" is the ""demonisation and de-legitimisation"" of Israel. ""Only extreme pressure brings results and the new anti-Semitism is the delegitimising of Israel,"" Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli is reported as saying. ""We work with the foreign ministry to bring nations around the world to adopt the wider definition of anti-Semitism outlined by the IHRA, and conduct studies and launch campaigns to negate the work of anti-Israel groups."" Commenting on Israel's latest onslaught on the besieged Gaza Strip, which has been met with a lot of criticism, Chikli said that the apartheid state had opened a ""command and control"" centre to provide the international press with information. Israel already has a well-funded propaganda — hasbara — structure in place. The deadly military offensive has boosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's poll ratings, according to latest surveys.

When asked about his first meeting with Saddam, Al-Dulaimi said he was not sure that it was him because of ""the difficult conditions resulting from his detention and physical and psychological torture. However, after speaking with him, when he mentioned certain incidents, I recognised him."" On 3 March 2003, former US President George Bush declared war on Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein and destroy the weapons of mass destruction that Iraq was alleged to have developed.

Tens of thousands were killed later. The allegation about weapons of mass destruction is believed widely to have been an excuse for the devastating invasion in order to effect regime change in Iraq.

France issues arrest warrant for Lebanon Central Bank chief for failing to attend legal hearing,Unknown,"May 16, 2023 at 6:05 pm",Europe & Russia+France+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"French prosecutors have issued an international arrest warrant for Lebanon's Central Bank Governor, Riad Salameh, after he failed to appear at a court hearing amid a series of legal cases against him. According to the news agency, Reuters, which cited anonymous sources close to the case, Salameh failed to show up at a hearing in the French capital, Paris, where an investigative magistrate was reportedly set to indict him over charges involving fraud and money laundering. The 72-year-old Central Bank chief – who has held his position for three decades and is blamed by many for being the architect of Lebanon's current and ongoing economic crisis – is suspected by investigators of misusing public funds and amassing a network of assets across Europe through the use of fraudulent financial systems. READ: France: Lebanon's politicians show no sign of saving their country Pierre-Olivier Sur, Salameh's lawyer, told the news agency that the Bank chief did not show up to the summons because they were sent to him too close to the day of the hearing. The sources also told it that the French prosecutors decided to issue the international arrest warrant instead of simply issuing a fresh summons. ""By having notified the summons less than 10 days before the scheduled date of the interrogation, the rules were not respected"", the lawyer said. ""The summons is therefore null and void."" Insisting that the warrant is a legal violation and the decision was taken based on ""double standards"" and ""presumptuous ideas"", Salameh revealed that he intends to appeal it, with his defence attorneys and assistant having reportedly sent an objection to the Lebanese judiciary over the French case. That objection is based on the claim that France was attempting to try a case already under investigation in Lebanon.

Saudi ambassador urges Lebanon to accelerate presidential election,Unknown,"May 16, 2023 at 5:33 pm",Lebanon+Middle East+News+Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Lebanon has renewed his call for the country to speed up its presidential elections, amid an ongoing gridlock in the process. According to the Saudi newspaper, Asharq Al-Awsat, Saudi ambassador, Walid Al-Bukhari, met Lebanon's Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, yesterday during a tour with Lebanese political figures, after which he stressed the importance of the country and its people electing a president, half a year after former President, Michel Aoun, ended his term without a successor to replace him. ""We [Saudis] share the same desire with the international community to see the completion of the presidential elections [in Lebanon] as soon as possible,"" Bukhari was quoted as saying. ""I want Lebanon to be, as it was, an oasis of thought and culture of life, and for its people to enjoy prosperity."" As it stands, Lebanon's political parties are still agreeing on the presidential candidates themselves, with the Shia parties Hezbollah and the Amal movement supporting Suleiman Frangieh – the head of Christian party, the Marada Movement – while the opposition is yet to agree on a candidate to support. READ: Lebanon caretaker Premier calls for 'saving' country by electing new president Opposition parties are currently divided between backing Army Commander, General Joseph Aoun, former lawmaker, Salah Honien and former ministers, Jihad Azour and Ziad Baroud. It also remains unclear whether Gebran Bassil, the head of the former president's Free Patriotic Movement, would join the opposition in rejecting Frangieh's candidacy. According to the paper, sources from the Christian-based Lebanese Forces party assured it that opposition parties are in talks to unify their position, and that if that party could agree with the Free Patriotic Movement, they would both secure a parliamentary majority with over 65 votes. Those sources also indicated that Bassil has already made a decision on who to support – without disclosing who – but that he is refraining from announcing that decision as he is trying to ensure Hezbollah would first back down from supporting Frangieh. The paper also quoted the sources as renewing their call for Parliamentary Speaker, Nabih Berri, to hold open sessions to elect the president, saying that it would lead to naming a candidate who reflects the aspirations of the Lebanese people instead of an Iran-backed candidate who works for the 'axis of resistance'. Saudi ambassador Bukhari's insistence on the continuation of progress in Lebanon's presidential election came barely a week after he reaffirmed Riyadh's neutrality and non-interference in the Lebanese electoral process, after stating earlier this month that the Kingdom does ""not accept the ongoing presidential vacuum that threatens the stability and unity"" of the country and its people.

"Israel Netanyahu faces budget test amid economic, political woes",Unknown,"May 16, 2023 at 4:46 pm",Israel+Middle East+News,"Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, faces a test this month when his coalition of nationalist and religious parties seeks approval for a spending package which the government's own budget unit says will stifle growth, Reuters reports. Lawmakers must approve the bi-annual 2023-24 budget package by the end of May to avoid triggering an election. With 64 of parliament's 120 seats, Netanyahu's coalition appears on course to vote it through. But economists say the spending plans could derail the government's own fiscal targets, while even the Finance Ministry says it could slow growth. Israelis are already grappling with rising living costs, while the economy has been knocked by the government's now-suspended judicial overhaul which triggered a political crisis, drove away investment and cut growth prospects. Three economists said the government's deficit targets of 1 per cent of gross domestic product in 2023 and 0.8 per cent in 2024 could double or triple in size, which could send bond yields up. READ: Israel to confiscate 36 acres of Palestinian land in West Bank ""Projections were too optimistic,"" Victor Bahar, Bank Hapoalim's Chief Economist, told Reuters. An official in Netanyahu's office played down concerns, saying: ""The Prime Minister along with the Finance Minister intend to pass a responsible budget in the coming weeks that will serve all Israelis. The budget will enhance stability and growth."" Strained by months of unprecedented street protests, Western disapproval and plummeting polls, the government has set 13.7 billion shekels ($3.8 billion) for ""coalition funds"", money to finance political deals with the ultra-Orthodox Jewish and pro-settler parties on which Netanyahu's coalition depends. The funds include adding hundreds of millions of shekels to stipends and schooling for the ultra-Orthodox community, which limits study of non-religious subjects like math and English, while its men focus on scripture and live off benefits. The ultra-Orthodox, or Haredim, are only 13 per cent of Israel's population but they are a fast-growing sector many of whose men – around half – are jobless. Many opt not to work, while those that do seek a job are often ill-equipped for employment. The Finance Ministry's budget division, in an unusual analysis on Thursday, said the government would reverse economic incentives to encourage Haredim into the workforce by increasing spending on religious schools, food stamps and stipends. Those steps would impact growth in the immediate and medium term, the analysis said, and would eventually hurt the ""productivity, growth and quality of life of all Israelis"". For Haredi leaders, scripture comes first. ""The finance clerks don't understand Haredim,"" ultra-Orthodox lawmaker, Yizhak Pindrus, told Kan radio. ""There will be no Israeli society, no Jewish society if there will be no people devoting their lives to Torah study."" Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said the funds would fix years of injustice toward the Haredim, whose children often are packed into derelict classrooms. He said other steps would be taken to help Haredim find jobs. ""There is no crisis here,"" he said, pointing to a fiscal surplus so far in 2023 and a responsible budget. But Michael Eisenberg, of Israeli venture capital firm, Aleph, said the extra spending would fuel inflation, hamper growth and ""cost Israel dearly, the ultra-Orthodox public too"". Government figures already forecast Israel's economic growth will ease in 2023 from 6.5 per cent in 2022 to about 2.7 per cent and down from the 3 per cent forecast in January. Credit ratings agency, S&P, forecasts growth of just 1.5 per cent for 2023 and says it could slow further because of political uncertainty over the government's suspended drive to limit the role of the Supreme Court in its judicial changes. Since returning to office in December, Netanyahu has fired his Defence Minister over his opposition to the judicial drive and then backtracked. He suspended the overhaul to allow for talks with the opposition and has faced a vote boycott by far-right minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. The judicial drive has led to a drop in foreign investment and prompted some capital flight. The shekel has weakened and Moody's has lowered Israel's outlook to stable. Judicial negotiations seeking broad agreements that would likely stave off further damage have, so far, been fruitless and some are concerned the budget does not properly factor in sharply slowing growth, potentially causing more damage.= ""Netanyahu has sold Israel's economy and our children's future in order to stay in power,"" said opposition leader, Yair Lapid.

Waves of solidarity sweep across Latin America on 75th Nakba anniversary,Unknown,"May 16, 2023 at 4:15 pm",Asia & Americas+Brazil+Chile+International Organisations+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+Peru+UN+Venezuela,"Solidarity activists across Latin America have marked the 75th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba with talks, meetings, cultural activities, media interviews and social media campaigns. The Palestinian flag has been raised and people have chanted their support on the streets. Support for Palestine has been particularly strong in Brazil, Peru, Venezuela and Chile. Palestinians and their supporters around the world mark Nakba Day every year. The day has come to symbolise the struggle of the Palestinian people for their legitimate rights to their own land, homes and property; indeed, their legitimate right to their homeland. The Palestinian ""Key of Return"" was never an ordinary key. It speaks of the years of refugee status and suffering that Palestinians have endured. It is hugely symbolic, because more than 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed before and after Israel declared its independence on 14 May. Dozens of flag-waving Palestinians participated in a mass rally in Santiago, the capital of Chile, to mark the anniversary. Some of the participants held keys as a symbol of their hope to return to their homes in Palestine. Chants of ""Free, free Palestine"" reverberated around the streets. Shortly before this year's Nakba Day, the Chilean-Palestinian parliamentary group in the Senate issued a declaration, which mentioned the ""new offensive that the occupying state has unleashed in the territory of Gaza. In the midst of silence from the international community, we reiterate once again the need for the UN Security Council to implement the Resolution for International Protection for the Palestinian people; and adhere to the call for the International Commission of Inquiry underway at the UN Human Rights Council to investigate these new crimes and submit its conclusions to both the International Criminal Court and the UN Security Council."" In Brazil, meanwhile, the President of the Freedom and Socialism Party, Juliano Medeiros, said: ""Today, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to support the right of return and the tireless struggle of the Palestinian people. We are united in the quest for justice and equality. We are on the side of Palestine!""  A post shared by Juliano Medeiros (@julianopsol)  Nakba Day activities in Brazil were held by many Palestinian and Brazilian organisations. Thousands of people took part in a demonstration of solidarity on Avenida Paulista, the most prominent street in Sao Paulo. The organisers invited the media to remind the world about the importance of this day and the importance of standing with the people of Palestine in occupied Jerusalem, Gaza and the rest of the occupied land. Solidarity activists called on the Brazilian government to take a clear position that defines Israel as an apartheid state, and play a greater role in pressuring the international community to condemn the Israeli occupation and stop its ongoing massacres of the Palestinian people. Dozens of people attended a solidarity festival in Lima, the capital of Peru, on Nakba Day 2023 (Photo: Embassy of Palestine in Peru) Nakba solidarity activities in Peru started earlier in Lima this year. The Palestinian Embassy in the capital revived a popular solidarity festival in partnership with the Lima Municipality, the municipality of San Borja, a district within the capital, and the Palestinian Arab Club.
More than four thousand solidarity activists took part in the festival, riding bicycles decorated with Palestinian flags and wearing Palestinian t-shirts. The festival was accompanied by an exhibition of Palestinian heritage introducing Palestinian handicrafts and embroidery. More than 4,000 booklets detailing the history of the Palestinian cause, Palestinian heritage and tourism in Palestine were distributed.
According to the Palestinian Embassy in Peru, a large number of political figures, senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ambassadors of Arab and Islamic countries, and other UN representative took part in the solidarity festival.

Nakba Day was commemorated differently in Venezuela, where the Bolivarian University of Venezuela held a special session to express solidarity and mark the catastrophe that displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Dr Jihad Youssef, Vice-President of the Palestinian Federation in Latin America and a member of the Palestinian National Council, spoke at the session. He presented some historical facts about the Zionist movement and the role of the colonial countries in the plight of the Palestinian people, and explained how the Palestinians were subjected to ethnic cleansing, killing, displacement, land confiscation and house demolitions.
Our people have not just studied what happened, they lived through it, and continue to experience its effects. That is why it is important to keep our grandparents' memories alive. They have, after all, shaped our own memory of that fateful time.
Just as we are told that we must understand other major historical events so that humanity doesn't allow history to repeat itself, we all need to know and understand what drove hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and flee for their lives in occupied Palestine from 1948 onwards. Time stopped for them in 1948, and will never return. Their land, though, will be returned, one way or another. That was always the certainty in our grandparents' hearts, and that certainty remains with us today.

Iran ups pressure on Taliban to resolve long-running water dispute,Unknown,"May 16, 2023 at 3:42 pm",Afghanistan+Asia & Americas+Iran+Middle East+News,"Iran has stepped up pressure on the Taliban government in Afghanistan to resolve a long-running dispute over shared water resources, Anadolu News Agency reports. The dispute is centred on the Hirmand River, also known as Helmand River, which originates in the Hindu Kush Mountains near Kabul and streams into Iran's Hamoun wetlands in the Sistan-Baluchestan province after flowing through 700 miles. Iran has, over the years, accused Afghanistan of restricting the flow of water from the river by constructing dams over it, a charge that Afghan authorities have denied. According to a 1973 water-sharing pact between Tehran and Kabul, Afghanistan was required to allow an average of 820 million cubic meters of water per annum to Iran. The issue has, in recent weeks, again become a subject of discussion with lawmakers calling on the government of President Ebrahim Raisi to take up the matter with the Taliban government in Kabul. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting on Monday, Raisi tasked the ministries of Foreign Affairs and Energy, as well as a Special Envoy for Afghanistan affairs to ""seriously pursue"" the matter, terming it an ""important issue"". READ: Afghanistan: Taliban reaches agreement with Iran over Helmand River rights In an interview with state TV on Tuesday, the Iranian President's Special Envoy for Afghan affairs, Hassan Kazemi Qomi, said the issue is being pursued with Afghan authorities and ""will be settled this year"". ""The issue of the (1973) treaty is a legal issue, to which the Afghan government is committed and has declared its adherence. It must also implement the treaty,"" he added. He said only 27 million cubic meters of water reached Iran last year compared to the 820 million cubic meters Iran is entitled to under the water-sharing treaty. In separate remarks on Tuesday, Iranian Energy Minister, Ali Akbar Mehrabian, said the government is taking ""serious steps"" to ensure proper implementation of the treaty. He added that the Taliban authorities in Kabul are committed to operationalising the water-sharing treaty, without providing further details. Taliban Energy Minister, Matiullah Abid, meanwhile, was quoted as saying by Afghanistan's Tolo News that Kabul is ""committed to the treaty"" with Iran, adding that water was allocated to Iran last year ""based on the treaty"". Last month, Iranian Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said he discussed the issue of shared water resources with his Afghan counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, on the sidelines of a conference in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. The Afghan side, he asserted, ""emphasised its commitment to Iran's water rights"" and both sides ""agreed to take immediate action"" in this regard. In July last year, the top Iranian diplomat had warned Afghanistan that the dispute could affect cooperation between the two countries, describing it as an ""important index"" of the Taliban government's ""commitments"". Iran shared close relations with the Taliban before the group came to power in Afghanistan in August 2021. The water-sharing dispute and frequent cross-border clashes have created coldness in their ties.

The head of the Al-Jalama village council, Amjad Abu Farha, was quoted by WAFA news agency as saying that the council received an Israeli military notice that includes a decision to seize 144 dunums of the lands of the villages of Al-Jalama and Arbouna ""for security purposes.""

Gaza family with 5 disabled siblings homeless after Israel air strike,Unknown,"May 16, 2023 at 3:31 pm",Africa+Egypt+Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine+Videos & Photo Stories,"When an Israeli missile struck the residential block of the Nabhan family in Gaza four days ago, no one was killed, but a family with five disabled members were among 45 people made homeless, Reuters reports. For the five siblings, three of whom are on wheelchairs and all five of whom suffer from physical disability, muscular dystrophy and convulsions, the misery was multiplied, as their wheelchairs, medicine, special beds and bathroom were buried under the rubble. The family now lives with relatives close to their old shelter. Every morning relatives carry them out as people continue to flock to the site, some showing sympathy at their harrowing experience, and others carrying gifts for the girls. ""The house blew up while we were being moved out. Our wheelchairs, medicine and clothes were inside. Nothing was left,"" said 16-year-old Hanin, who has a disability in both legs. The others are aged 3, 18, 29 and 38. The emotional toll of losing the house seemed to have worsened the older brother's mental state, as he has become very nervous, always shouting and sometimes crying, his relatives said. READ: The symbolic Nakba commemoration at the UN exposed Israel's hatred of the truth According to officials from Hamas, the group that governs the Gaza Strip, the latest round of Israeli air strikes, which began on 9 May, destroyed 15 residential blocks, containing more than 50 flats. In addition, 940 buildings have been damaged, 49 beyond repair. The Israeli military says it makes every effort to limit civilian casualties and damage and accuses the group of hiding command centres and other military sites in residential areas. On 13 May, Hanin's older brother, Jalal, received a call from a private number, but he went out to let his cousin respond as he stutters while talking. The caller was an Israeli officer who ordered them to evacuate the house five minutes before they bombed it. The cousin, Hussam Nabhan, 45, tried to stall the officer, telling him the house included disabled people, but it was all in vain, he said. ""He told me you have five minutes. We rushed to the house and found the girls lying on the ground. Thanks to the neighbours, we have been able to take them out and we managed to leave the house by a miracle,"" he told Reuters. The mother, Najah, 57, said they failed to take anything from the house, even the identity cards. ""The house was the girls' shelter; they had got a disabled toilet, wheelchairs, a bed to sleep. Things that had been difficult to get, now there is nothing,"" Najah said. ""How am I going to carry her after the wheeler was gone, also the [healthy] mattresses were gone,"" she added. The Gaza Strip is home to 2.3 million Palestinians in cities, towns, and refugee camps squeezed within an area of 365 square kilometres (141 square miles). Its borders are sealed off by Israel. Several wars and a 16-year-old Israeli blockade have crippled the enclave's already ailing economy.

World Bank: Jordan could face 'shocks' due to high poverty rates,Unknown,"May 16, 2023 at 3:09 pm",International Organisations+Jordan+Middle East+News+World Bank,"The World Bank warned of shocks affecting Jordan's economy resulting from rising poverty at rates higher than the period that preceded the coronavirus pandemic. In its report on global poverty for the year 2023, the bank said the real income rates of Jordanians have remained suppressed and predicted that poverty rates will reduce rapidly during the current year due to the continued weak economic growth rates and the ongoing challenges facing the economy including limited job opportunities, labour market division, low labour productivity and weak household income growth rates. The report pointed to the dominance of regional and global pressures on the Jordanian social and economic scene over the past decade, which led to a slowdown in growth rates. According to the report, the labour market conditions remain the biggest threat to the well-being of Jordanian families, as employment recovered modestly, while the labour force participation rate remained low at 33.7 per cent. The unemployment rate reached 22.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 19.0 per cent during the same period in the fourth quarter of 2019, prior to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

Israel settlers set fire to Palestinian crops in Bethlehem,Unknown,"May 16, 2023 at 1:44 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"Israeli settlers today set fire to crops belonging to two Palestinian farmers in Kisan village, east of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. Mayor Mousa Ebayyat told Wafa news agency that a group of extremists from the illegal Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Amos torched wheat and barley crops planted in a plot of land belonging to farmers from the village. This is not the first time village land and residents have come under attack from Israeli settlers and soldiers, he added.The town of Kisan has been subject to repeated attacks by settlers against farmers, abusing them, stealing their equipment and preventing them from grazing their livestock. Over 700,000 Israelis live in the illegal Jewish-only settlements across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in violation of international law. All of Israel's settlements and the settlers who live there are illegal under international law. Last year, Israeli settlers attacked a group of Palestinians and foreign solidarity activists who volunteered to help pick olives in Kisan village. Settler gangs also uprooted more than 300 olive saplings and sprayed olive trees with incendiary chemicals. Kisan, a village cut off from other neighbouring Palestinian villages, is inhabited by 800 people and is surrounded by the two illegal Israeli settlements of Maale Amos and Avi Menahem. Its area is about 133,278 dunams (133 square kilometres). Israeli settlers expropriated 2,201 dunams (2.2 square kilometres) of its land. The village does not have transportation, electricity, water networks or a medical clinic. Like hundreds of other Palestinian towns and villages in the occupied West Bank, Kisan is located in 'Area C' under the Oslo Accords, putting it under full Israeli military and administrative control.

If an Arab student is charged with raising the Palestine flag or supporting the Palestinian resistance against the Israeli occupation, according to the law, they would be dismissed from their university. Meanwhile, the law calls for academic institutions to prevent the existence of student bodies that violate Israeli laws. According to the Israeli daily, heads of Israeli universities strongly criticised the law, stressing: ""It is problematic and dangerous."" Heads of Israeli universities expressed their hope that the education minister would undermine the law proposal at the Knesset's Legislative Committee. READ: Israel university authorities slam bill criminalising the Palestinian flag as 'fascist' They suggested that such a law aims to turn universities into arms for the Israeli police and intelligence services as they would be ordered to monitor thousands of students and punish them over issues protected under the freedom of expression laws. At the same time, the university heads indicated that such a law has consequences for the academic ties and status between Israeli universities and their international counterparts. In addition, it would lead to a wide-scale wave of academic boycotts of Israeli universities. Head of Tel Aviv University Ariel Porat responded to the law proposal: ""The Palestinian Authority is not a hostile state or a terrorist organisation. Raising its flag is protected under the freedom of expression law."" Porat added: ""If we applied this law, we would be likely obliged to have a large number of our students away from the university. They would not bear this suppression and would not hesitate to raise the PA flag."" The current Israeli government is the most extremist ever in Israel's history. Since its formation last year, it has introduced several apartheid laws affecting Arabs in Israel and the Palestinians and encouraged illegal settlement.

"Israel settlers burn Palestine vehicles, crops in occupied West Bank",Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 1:02 pm",Israel+Middle East+News+Palestine,"Extremist Israeli settlers burnt Palestinian vehicles and crops on Friday between the villages of Turmus Ayya and Al-Mughayyir, northeast of the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah. Local sources reported aggression of Israeli settlers from Adei Ad illegal settlement on Palestinians after burning the vehicles and crops in both Palestinian villages. A Palestinian youth was wounded in the head after being shot, and four others were also injured when the Israeli settlers threw stones at Palestinians in Turmus Ayya. Meanwhile, Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian farmers and prevented them from ploughing their farms in the village of Sanjal, north of Ramallah.

"Kuwait, Philippines crisis after workers' visa suspensions",Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 12:30 pm",Asia & Americas+Kuwait+Middle East+News+Philippines,"A new conflict has occurred between Kuwait and the Philippines over the protection of domestic workers and the rights of Kuwaiti employers after the Gulf state suspended visas for Filipino workers due to the ""wrong practices"" by the Philippines Embassy in the country. With about a quarter of a million Filipino workers in Kuwait, most of whom are domestic workers, the differences between the two countries are not new. There have been several rounds of talks in the past to reach understandings, but it seems they haven't reached a resolution that satisfies both parties. The suspension of visas comes after the Philippines stopped sending domestic workers to Kuwait in February for the first time after the body of Jullebee Ranara was found in the Kuwaiti desert in January. Large numbers of Filipino nationals work abroad, with about 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product coming from expat transfers. On Wednesday, Kuwait's Ministry of Interior confirmed in a statement that it had suspended visas for Filipino workers ""as a result of the wrong practices"" of the Philippines Embassy in Kuwait as well as the ""crimes"" committed by some members of the Filipino community against Kuwaitis. The statement indicated that the most prominent violation is the embassy's sheltering of Filipino workers in a centre for it, communicating with Kuwaiti citizens and summoning them without the permission of the Kuwaiti authorities, forcing travel agencies to search for runaway domestic workers and ""playing the role of state institutions"" and pressuring Kuwaiti employers to add contractual clauses against their will. The statement added that Kuwait stipulated during the talks the ""recognition and acknowledgement"" of the embassy of the Philippines that it had violated Kuwaiti laws and decisions and had breached diplomatic norms. It also asked that it promises not to repeat these acts. In return, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior will assess the situation and ensure that the embassy adheres to the conditions for at least three months: ""After which it decides what it deems appropriate."" READ: Kuwait to continue ban on visas for Philippines workers after talks fail to resolve labour dispute The statement said that the Philippine side rejected these conditions and, therefore, the Ministry of Interior: ""Adheres to its position rejecting any violations of the state's sovereignty and the dignity of its citizens and continues its decision to suspend all types of visas for the Filipino community until further notice,"" while continuing to renew the residency of those who have a valid residency. A crisis between the two countries ended more than five years ago with the Philippine side's apology in 2018 for what Kuwait considered a violation of its sovereignty after the Philippines Embassy in Kuwait ""rescued"" a number of Filipinos working in homes amid reports of violations. The Philippine Foreign Minister said at the time that the embassy had to ""help"" Filipino workers who sought help because some situations were considered a matter of life or death, stressing respect for Kuwait's sovereignty and laws: ""But the interest of Filipino workers is also very important."" The Philippine side did not comment on the Kuwaiti statement. However, after the two sides' talks last week, the Philippine Foreign Ministry shared that its delegation affirmed its ""full respect for Kuwaiti laws."" The statement on 18 May conveyed the measures taken by the Embassy and Government of the Philippines regarding the services provided to the migrant workers: ""Are solely to ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens."" The Philippines' Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega remarked in press statements last week that Kuwait's suspension of entry visas for Filipinos came in response to Manila's suspension of sending new domestic workers to the Gulf country in February, and that the Kuwaiti decision aims to pressure his country to lift this ban. De Vega noted that Kuwait is concerned about two issues and considers them a violation of its laws, namely the establishment of a shelter for runaway domestic workers and communicating with Kuwaiti employers regarding reports of violations. He added: ""Providing protection to a country's citizens abroad is a well-established duty of consular offices under international law and convention,"" adding that they do not encourage them to run away from their employers, but in the case of abuse, they should have a place to go to.

Algeria ambassador to Italy sparks controversy with 'Tunisia stability' remarks,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 11:34 am",Africa+Algeria+Europe & Russia+Italy+News+Tunisia+Turkey,"Abdelkrim Touahria has sparked controversy after informing Italian news agency Nova that his country: ""Works closely with Italy to maintain stability in Tunisia."" Touahria explained: ""We are fully committed to addressing the situation in Tunisia, which concerns us, and we closely cooperate with Italy to prevent any form of instability in this country. Our common goal is to contribute to maintaining stability in Tunisia."" Former deputy Majdi Al-Karbawi commented: ""Where are the 'national sovereign line' group? So if there is no talk about Turkey, democracy and human rights, they remain silent! Tell us now, are we affiliated with Algeria or Italy?"" READ: Algeria: Controversy over Emir Abdelkader statue Al-Quds Al-Arabi researcher and political activist Hassan Zarkouni criticised Touahria's statement: ""How will Algeria coordinate with Italy to maintain stability in Tunisia? Will this be done through the GALSI project for gas transportation, which ignores Tunisian territory, knowing that nearly 55 per cent of the gas in Tunisia comes from Algeria and that 98 per cent of electricity is gas-generated? Or will it be through allowing the pollution of the Mjerdah Basin with industrial and urban waste? Or by misusing the shared groundwater resources between the Algerian Souf Valley and the Tunisian Ghardimaou region, which goes against our bilateral agreements and treaties?"" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stirred controversy months ago when she revealed she had discussed ""expected scenarios in Tunisia"" with President Abdelmajid Tebboune, causing outrage in Tunisia. Tebboune further sparked contention when he stated that his country had agreed with Italy to assist Tunisia in returning to the democratic path.

Reporters Without Borders calls for Egypt to release Tawfik Ghanem,Unknown,"May 27, 2023 at 10:37 am",Africa+Egypt+International Organisations+News+Reporters Without Borders (RSF)+UN,"Reporters Without Borders has called on the Egyptian authorities to release Tawfik Ghanem, the former bureau chief of the Anadolu Agency office in Cairo, noting that he had begun his third year in detention without being brought to trial. The organisation stated on its website, signed by the head of its Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, that imprisonment without trial is a common practice in Egypt, where 12 of the 20 imprisoned journalists are being held in pre-trial detention. The statement noted that Egyptian police: ""Arrested [Ghanem] at his home on 21 May, 2021, and was held incommunicado for five days before being brought before a prosecutor and placed in provisional detention for allegedly belonging to a 'banned organisation' and spreading 'false information,'"" noting that these charges are ""often used to detain journalists in Egypt."" Ghanem has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years, as his provisional detention has been renewed every 15 to 45 days since 26 May, 2021. READ: UN: Malnutrition risk for half a million Yemen children Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Egyptian code of criminal procedure has a two-year limit on pre-trial detention, regardless of the charges. However, Ghanem is still being detained and deprived of medical care. He is 69 years old and suffers from serious health problems, including being diabetic. The statement confirmed that the authorities do not allow Ghanem to receive the treatment for diabetes he requires at Abu Zaabal prison, except when he is visited by his children every two weeks. The prison administration also ignores his other chronic illnesses, including bone pain. According to the statement, in 2021, a prison doctor declared that Ghanem should be sent to hospital for further examination for tumours. The authorities promised to do this but never fulfilled their promise. ""The Egyptian authorities must stop using provisional detention as a punitive tool against journalists. Tawfik Ghanem is a courageous and reputable media professional who should not have to spend his retirement in prison,"" asserted Jonathan Dagher. ""We denounce this flagrant injustice and call on the authorities to drop the charges against him and free him immediately so that he can receive appropriate medical care as soon as possible,"" he added. Reporters Without Borders wrote to the United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, torture, the independence of judges and the right to health and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention two months after his arrest in July 2021 to ask them to take all the necessary steps with the Egyptian authorities to obtain Ghanem's immediate and unconditional release.

Turkiye homes in northern Syria for voluntary return of Syria refugees,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 8:07 pm",Europe & Russia+Middle East+News+Syria+Turkey,"Ankara is currently working on the safe return of Syrian refugees in Turkiye to their country, Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said, as Syrian citizens praise the peaceful atmosphere created in Syria after their voluntary return, Anadolu Agency reports. Erdogan, on Thursday, also noted that ""with the support of Qatar, the work to build houses in Syria, which can accommodate 1 million refugees, continues."" Wafaa Mustafa Hajjaj, a Syrian citizen who lives with her child and nephews in Azaz in the countryside of Aleppo, told Anadolu that she came to Turkiye for treatment after she lost her eyesight in an attack on her village. Hajjaj, who stayed in Turkiye for five years, pointed out that during each stay, Turkish people have always supported her and her family. Hajjaj noted that she voluntarily returned to Syria. An infographic titled ""Falling number of Syrians refugees going home from Jordan, Lebanon"" is created in Ankara, Turkiye on October 25, 2022 [Yılmaz Yücel/Anadolu Agency]0The Syrian citizen hailed the Turkish effort in preparing the infrastructure for the Syrian refugees' return.

She stressed the safety of the area she currently resides, adding: ""I believe that the rest of the Syrian refugees will return to their homeland whenever security prevails.""
""These areas are now safe because of Turkiye's presence,"" she added.
Turkish Interior Minister, Suleyman Soylu, on Wednesday attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the project, ""Voluntary, Safe, Honourable Return Project"" in the northern Syria district of Jarablus, where he said a total of 240,000 houses will be constructed at nine separate locations across the Idlib and Afrin regions in the next three years.
Since 2016, Turkiye has launched four successful anti-terror operations across its border in northern Syria to prevent the formation of a terror corridor and enable peaceful settlement by locals: Euphrates Shield (2016), Olive Branch (2018), Peace Spring (2019) and Spring Shield (2020).
Thanks to these operations, the pace of the return of Syrian refugees from Turkiye to their country has accelerated.

Following the start of a civil war in Syria in 2011, Turkiye adopted an ""open-door"" policy for Syrians fleeing persecution and brutality.
Syria has been embroiled in a vicious civil war since early 2011, when the Bashar Al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and more than 10 million others displaced, according to UN estimates.

Lebanon to take steps to fix finance sector shortfalls - Finance Intelligence Unit,Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 7:59 pm",Africa+Lebanon+Middle East+News,"Lebanon will work over the next year to address deficiencies in policing corruption identified by a financial crime watchdog, the country's Financial Intelligence Unit said on Friday, Reuters reports. The Special Investigation Commission said in a statement it ""discussed and adopted"" an evaluation report by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) during the body's plenary this week in Bahrain. The evaluation is a crucial step towards regaining or further degrading trust in Lebanon's financial system, which has been in a tailspin since 2019. Its authorities are struggling to implement reforms to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. The report will be published in June, the Commission said, without noting any amendments to the draft. A draft seen by Reuters showed Lebanon scored as only partially compliant in several categories, including anti-money laundering measures, transparency on beneficial ownership of firms and mutual legal assistance in asset freezing and confiscation. The cumulative score put Lebanon ""one mark over the threshold to be grey-listed,"" said a diplomatic source. The Commission did not respond to requests for comment. Its statement cited ""recent uninformed statements and analysis that Lebanon may be listed on the 'grey list' this week'."" ""Lebanon will have to take corrective measures to address the identified deficiencies and submit to MENAFATF a progress report during 2024,"" it added. Being on the grey list could disrupt a country's capital flows, the IMF found in a 2021 paper, with banks possibly ending relationships with customers in high-risk countries to reduce compliance costs. Other risks include reputational damage, credit ratings adjustments, trouble obtaining global finance and higher transaction costs. Lebanon's financial crisis has severely restricted banking transactions and many corresponding institutions have cut their ties to the country. It has made little progress on reforms required by the IMF, and its Central Bank Governor has been charged by France in a financial fraud case, triggering an Interpol Red Notice.

"3 dead, 12 missing as migrant boat capsizes in Aegean Sea",Unknown,"May 26, 2023 at 6:18 pm",Europe & Russia+Greece+News,"Three migrants were killed and twelve others are still missing after their boat capsized off the Mykonos Island in the Aegean Sea on Friday morning, Greek state broadcaster ERT said, Anadolu Agency reports. The coast guard has been carrying out a search and rescue operation since the early hours of Friday. Two migrants, a Syrian and a Palestinian, who were on board the boat, were rescued. Initially, the migrants, who were rescued and transported safely to the island's port, said six people were aboard the boat, but they later confirmed that 15 people were on the boat. Several humanitarian groups have continuously accused the Greek government for its treatment of migrants arriving in Greece and its illegal push backs which violate several human rights laws. In April, video footage recorded on the island of Lesvos by an Austrian activist and later released by the US-based newspaper The New York Times, revealed the illegal push backs the Greek government has been denying. The video showed 12 migrants, including children and a 6-month-old infant, being transported by a van to a nearby remote area where they were forcefully seen boarding a high-speed inflatable boat. According to the report, the man who drove the vehicle was wearing a balaclava. The irregular migrants were later transferred to a Greek Coast Guard vessel before being abandoned on a floating boat in the middle of the Aegean Sea and set adrift until they were picked up by the Turkish Coast Guard. Former Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, argued that his government's policy towards irregular migration is tough but fair, and that the video is being investigated. In 2015-16, Greece was at the epicentre of the migration crisis, with nearly 1 million refugees crossing its borders in search of safety from war-stricken countries.

"Bahrain schools ordered by King to remove lessons teaching about Israel, normalisation deals",Unknown,"May 12, 2023 at 2:59 pm",Asia & Americas+Bahrain+Israel+Middle East+News+US,"Bahrain's educational institutions have been ordered by King Salman Al Khalifa not to implement any changes to the curriculum that are ""not compatible with Bahrain's national values designed to protect religion and its core pillars."" According to Alarabiya News, the announcement came on Tuesday following issues raised by critics regarding the inclusion of Israel and changes to the maps of the contested Israeli-Palestinian territories. A statement from the government, shared online, said, ""His Royal Highness ordered the Minister of Education to ensure educational curricula adhere to Islamic teachings, in line with the National Action Charter and the Constitution."" ""His Royal Highness reiterated that the Islamic religion is inviolable and should be respected and protected at all costs,"" it added. The amendment made to subjects in primary schools included a lesson on the normalisation of ties between the Gulf State and Israel and removal of lessons on the Jews, reported BBC Arabic. The changes provoked preachers and scholars, issuing statements calling on the Ministry of Education to reconsider the amendments, which resulted in the order from the Crown Prince to suspend lessons teaching about Israel and the normalisation deals. Bahrain and Israel signed a normalisation of a US-brokered Abraham Accords deal in Washington in September 2020 and, since then, they have exchanged diplomats and signed agreements in security and commerce. However, Manama's normalisation with Israel has proven to be widely unpopular by Bahrain's citizens who have routinely held rallies against the 2020 decision.

"China resumes construction of military base in UAE, defying US objections",Unknown,"April 30, 2023 at 9:33 am",Asia & Americas+China+Middle East+News+UAE+US,"China has resumed construction work on a military base in the United Arab Emirates in defiance of displeasure by the United States, leaked intelligence documents have revealed. According to the Washington Post, leaked US intelligence documents that it obtained reportedly show that Chinese plans to continue construction in its military base in the UAE have gone ahead. The suspected Chinese military facility at Khalifa port near Abu Dhabi is part of plans to create a global network of military facilities at ports across the Middle East, south-east Asia, and Africa by 2030, labelled 'project 141.' The reported continuation of the build-up of that base comes after the works there were forced to halt in 2021 due to US objections. According to the outlet, however, US intelligence detected the resumed construction in December, a mere year after it was apparently halted. READ: China to help UAE land first rover on moon US intelligence continues to monitor Chinese activity at the base and at other locations in the UAE, the documents reportedly show, amid concerns that the Gulf state is drawing ever closer to China. The revelation is predicted to likely further alarm the US government, with the paper highlighting that the presence of Chinese officials at several sensitive military sites has particularly raised concern amongst US intelligence, especially at a time when Washington's allies across the Middle East and Gulf continue to strengthen ties with Beijing. In that regional shift, the UAE, as well as others such as Saudi Arabia, have increasingly been acting in contradiction to American foreign policy interests, even to the point of directly snubbing US concerns with regards to issues such as ties with China and Russia, the refusal to support Ukraine, and the insistence on imposing cuts on oil production.

"Brazil´s president: The UN was so strong enough to create Israel, but now can't create a Palestinian state",Unknown,"April 28, 2023 at 11:43 am",Africa+Asia & Americas+Brazil+Egypt+Europe & Russia+France+Germany+India+International Organisations+Iraq+Israel+Japan+Libya+Middle East+News+Nigeria+Palestine+South Africa+Spain+UK+UN+US,"Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva this week slammed the UN's inability to create a Palestinian State in the same manner that it established the state of Israel in 1948. ""The UN was so strong that, in 1948, it managed to create the State of Israel. In 2023, it fails to create a Palestinian state,"" Lula said. Speaking during an official visit to Spain, Lula continued: ""We live in the world where the UN Security Council, the permanent members, they are the ones who sell the most weapons in the world, they are the biggest participants in wars in the world."" ""When the United States invaded Iraq, there was no discussion in the Security Council. When France and England invaded Libya and when Russia invaded Ukraine, there was no discussion either,"" he added. Astonished by the reduced role non-member states play in the international organisation, he asked the UN Security Council not to limit itself to its permanent members. ""I am therefore left wondering whether it is up to us, other countries that are not permanent [members] of the UN Security Council, to make a change. Why aren't Brazil, Spain, Japan, Germany, India, Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa [ permanent members]? The winners of the Second World War currently determine that, but the world has changed."" ""We need to build a new international mechanism that does things differently. I think it's time for us to start changing things and it's time for us to create a G20 of Peace, which should be the UN,"" he said. His calls were slammed by the pro-Israel group, StandWithUs Brasil, who said: ""Contrary to what the president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said, Israel was not created by the United Nations. In 1947, what the UN Partition advocated was the creation of two countries, one for Jews and the other for Arabs. The Jews accepted; the Arabs did not."" ""The State of Israel was founded after a war waged by the armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq against the Jews."" ""As for a State for Palestinians, neither the UN nor other international organisations currently have the role of creating it, unless Palestinians and Israelis themselves come to seal the peace independently,"" the statement added.
