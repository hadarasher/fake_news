June 2023

The purpose of our data science project was to develop a system for detecting fake news articles. In an era of information overload and the rapid spread of misinformation, our goal was to leverage data science techniques to build a robust and reliable model that could differentiate between genuine and fake news.

The stages of the project:

- Data Collection - Crawling
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Visualizations
- Text Analysis and Machine learning - Supervised Learning
