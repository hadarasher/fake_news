       "Iran regime close to getting nuclear bomb, but what's the holdup?                                            Benjamin Weinthal           2023-05-26  News        Fox News' Jennifer Griffin reports from the Pentagon on worrisome progress being made on deep underground Iranian nuclear facility. JERUSALEM — Iran has moved dangerously close to enriching weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb, but the regime has not yet crossed the critical threshold of declaring it has built an atomic weapon. Fox News Digital reached out to experts on Iran’s more than two-decade effort to join the small group of countries that have atomic weapons for explanations about what is stopping Tehran from crossing the nuclear threshold. \"If there is reason to believe that there are a number of retardants that have put a pause in their weapons development, they’d relate back to targeted attacks by the U.S. and Israel, who clearly are very much concerned about stopping the mullahs,\" stated Lisa Daftari, an Iran expert and editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk. Daftari added, \"Israel has reportedly conducted at least two dozen targeted operations on Iran’s regime in the last 15 or so years, including drone attacks, cyberattacks, if you recall Stuxnet and assassinations of key players in Iran’s nuclear program.\" IRAN UNVEILS LATEST VERSION OF BALLISTIC MISSILE AMID WIDER TENSIONS OVER NUCLEAR PROGRAM The flag of Iran waves in front of the International Center building at the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria, May 24, 2021.  (AP Photo/Florian Schroetter, FILE) \"We cannot underestimate the power of international pressure on Iran’s regime,\" Daftari told Fox News Digital. \"That pressure has been assuaged under this current administration, who, while stepping away from the nuclear deal, are still hoping to revive some form of normalization agreement with Tehran. Otherwise, when there is consistent and targeted pressure on Iran’s regime in the form of enforced sanctions and economic and political isolation, we see a weakened regime and an emboldened Iranian people who are brave enough to take to the streets,\" she said. Kamal Kharrazi, a senior adviser to the Supreme Leader of Iran’s regime, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, boasted last year that \"Iran is on the nuclear threshold, and this is not something secret,\" according to a 2022 report in the state-controlled Tehran Times. Just this year, the International Atomic Energy Agency revealed Iran’s regime enriched 84% purity of uranium, 6% shy of the 90% enriched uranium required for a nuclear weapon.

Israel views Tehran’s atomic weapon program as an existential threat because Tehran has frequently declared it seeks to obliterate it. \"It’s an open question as to whether Khamenei wants to die as the father of the Shiite atomic bomb or as the one who kept the Islamic Republic on the nuclear path without provoking a war or pulling the trigger,\" Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow and Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital. \"Currently, however, Khamenei’s perception of diplomatic and security policy success abroad and ascendency at all costs at home may be sufficient to push him over the edge as he continues to age,\" added Taleblu, who recently authored a comprehensive assessment of Iran's ballistic missile capabilities and intentions. Fox News Digital reported this week that Iran is burrowing deep into tunnels near a peak of the Zagros Mountains in central Iran to shield a nuclear facility from conventional weapon attacks.

(Atomic Energy Organization of Iran via AP, File) Aside from the technological impediments for the construction of a modern nuclear weapon, Iran’s regime has been confronted with deterrence from Israel and the United States over the years, including Stuxnet computer worm sabotage of the regime’s nuclear fuel production system. \"I think Iran's leadership to date has calculated the costs of doing so would outweigh the benefits at this juncture — mainly a destructive attack which targets its entire nuclear infrastructure,\" Jason Brodsky, policy director of the U.S.-based United Against a Nuclear Iran (UANI), told Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) \"But my concern is that calculus risks changing as the U.S. and Europe's non-response to Iran's nuclear escalation over the last two years — for example 60% enrichment and production of uranium metal — has emboldened Tehran's leadership to continue testing international red lines.\" Brodsky added that \"If that perception is not altered, Iran is likely to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels at 90%. Tehran's risk-aversion to date shows that it can be deterred. But that can quickly change if the Islamic Republic receives no pushback as it advances its nuclear program.\" Earlier this month U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy that the Biden administration had \"Made it clear to Iran that it can never be permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon. As President Biden has repeatedly reaffirmed, he will take the actions that are necessary to stand by this statement, including recognizing Israel’s freedom of actions.\" \"We’ve restored unity of purpose between the United States and Europe and much of the world against Iranian provocations, nuclear activities,\" he said while also noting that the U.S. is exerting pressure on \"Iran through sanctions.\" Iranian Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri and IRGC Aerospace Force Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh stand together during the unveiling of a Kheibar Sheka missile at an undisclosed location in Iran Feb. 9, 2022. (West Asia News Agency/Handout via REUTERS ) \"Iran has not crossed the threshold into building a nuclear weapon because the supreme leader has not decided to weaponize the program,\" Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served in the Obama administration, told Fox News Digital. \"This position has been confirmed by multiple U.S. intelligence community assessments over the past several years.\" He continued that \"While only the supreme leader can truly say why he has taken this position, it's known that continued diplomatic isolation by the international community that followed the expansion of its nuclear program is causing pain for the Iranian regime.\" AIR FORCE SQUADRON IN MIDDLE EAST ARMS UP WITH 'BUNKER BUSTING' BOMBS TO COUNTER IRAN Rubin said it was clear that Tehran was \"Still open to pursuing a diplomatic path as it knows that if it crosses into weapons-grade nuclear arsenals, which it is capable of doing, the nation would be further isolated internationally — even by its allies. It would trigger a regional nuclear arms race, and Tehran would never get out from under the sanctions pressure it currently is experiencing,\" he said. \"What is clear from recent years is that a firm, verifiable diplomatic agreement with Iran over its nuclear program is the best way to ensure that it never obtains a nuclear weapon. Military threats alone will not get us there,\" Rubin concluded. U.S. Central Command and the IDF are taking part in a joint military exercise known as \"Exercise Juniper Oak\" taking place in Israel and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.  (IDF Spokesman's Unit) Low-intensity military deterrence against Iran’s regime has been playing out for a number of years, according to Israeli media outlets. \"We have the ability to hit Iran,\" Israel’s defense chief warned this week. The United States military and Israel Defense Forces launched a joint drill, Juniper Falcon, in February. The IDF's website stated \"The exercise tested collective U.S.-Israel readiness and strengthened the interoperability between the two militaries,\" the IDF stated on its website after the drill. Yet there are growing concerns the Biden administration is not inflicting enough pressure on Iran’s regime to change its conduct. Over 100 former world leaders urged Biden this week to get tough on Iran. Earlier this week Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reportedly said during a visit to Hatzor Air Force Base that Israel is preparing for a \"complex, difficult and more significant objective.\" Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, points to a red line he drew on a graphic of a bomb while addressing the United Nations General Assembly Sept. 27, 2012, in New York City. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) EX-MOSSAD CHIEF SIGNALS ISRAEL BEHIND IRAN NUCLEAR ATTACKS Military deterrence has been the single greatest factor in slowing Iran’s illicit nuclear program. U.S. saber-rattling has influenced a change in the Islamic Republic’s behavior. In 2007, a declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate determined with \"high confidence\" that Iran’s regime stopped it nuclear weapons program in 2003. Iran experts believe the Islamic Republic temporarily pulled the plug on its illegal atomic program due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and fears the U.S. would launch a military incursion into Iran. The sheer survival of Iran’s regime forced the then supreme leader Khomeini to agree to a cease-fire with Iraq in 1988 after eight years of war. At the time he compared the truce to drinking from \"a chalice of poison.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP American pressure prompted Khomeini to release U.S. hostages in 1981 during the diplomatic crisis. All of these examples suggest Iran’s regime is enormously vulnerable to military pressure and other forms of leverage that threaten its legitimacy and existence. \"Iran’s regime is quite calculating,\" Daftari said. \"As rogue as they have been in capturing oil tankers in the seas, continuing the support of regional terror and, of course, the brutal wholesale executions of innocent protesters, they continue to weigh out the consequences of a heated military confrontation with Israel or the United States.\" Benjamin Weinthal reports on Israel, Iran, Syria, Turkey and Europe for Fox News Digital.

       "White House unveils first-ever national strategy to combat antisemitism, 'the world's oldest hatred'         Aaron Kliegman              2023-05-25  News        Filmmaker Steven Spielberg warned against antisemitism in the US becoming more overt. ‘Not since Germany in the ‘30s have I witnessed antisemitism no longer lurking but standing proud ...’ The White House on Thursday released a broad national strategy to fight antisemitism, describing the initiative as unprecedented in scope amid a surge in anti-Jewish crime. However, the White House evaded an increasingly contentious debate over how to define antisemitism, avoiding a clear endorsement of a mainstream, widely accepted definition while simultaneously welcoming an alternative pushed by progressives who argue the former doesn't allow sufficient space to criticize Israel, the world's only Jewish state. The 60-page document details four pillars that undergird the strategy: increasing awareness and understanding of antisemitism and appreciation of Jewish American heritage, improving safety and security for Jewish communities, reversing the normalization of antisemitism and countering antisemitic discrimination and building solidarity across communities to counter hate. President Biden called the strategy \"a historic step forward\" and the \"most ambitious and comprehensive U.S. government-led effort to fight antisemitism in American history\" in a pre-recorded video message to kick off Thursday's announcement.

(Jewel Samad/AFP via Getty Images) VIRGINIA DEMS KILLED MEASURES AIMED AT COMBATTING ANTISEMITISM — JUST BEFORE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY \"It sends a clear and forceful message,\" Biden said of the strategy, arguing silence in the face of antisemitism is the same as complicity. \"In America, evil will not win. Hate will not prevail. The venom of antisemitism will not be the story of our time.\" Biden's message also included one explicitly political moment, when he called out former President Trump's remarks from 2017 that some protesters opposing the removal of Confederate statues in Charlottesville, Va., were \"very fine people,\" without naming his predecessor. After Biden spoke, his outgoing domestic policy adviser, Susan Rice, and his homeland security adviser, Liz Sherwood-Randall, along with second gentleman Doug Emhoff, outlined key elements of the strategy, which includes more than 100 policy commitments across the executive branch. The document also contains more than 100 calls to action for lawmakers and others across society to take in order to combat antisemitism. These include calls for tech companies to establish a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech on their platforms to ensure their algorithms don't pass hate speech and extreme content to users, among many others. The strategy also argues that antisemitism must be defined to combat it: \"If we cannot name, identify, and admit a problem, we cannot begin to solve it.\" However, rather than endorse a definition, the White House refers to several competing definitions of antisemitism as educational tools for both elected officials and the public.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) ANTISEMITIC INCIDENTS, HATE CRIMES ON THE RISE IN CALIFORNIA, ACCORDING TO REPORT \"There are several definitions of antisemitism, which serve as valuable tools to raise awareness and increase understanding of antisemitism,\" the strategy states. \"The most prominent is the non-legally binding 'working definition' of antisemitism adopted in 2016 by the 31-member states of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), which the United States has embraced. In addition, the administration welcomes and appreciates the Nexus Document and notes other such efforts.\" As of the end of last year, a total of 1,116 global entities — from countries to companies — have adopted and endorsed IHRA's non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, according to the Combat Antisemitism Movement. In the U.S., this includes at least 30 states and 56 cities and counties. The State and Education departments did the same under the Trump administration. According to the definition, antisemitism \"is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\" IHRA provides 11 specific, contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace and in the religious sphere. Beyond classic antisemitic behavior associated with the likes of the medieval period and Nazi Germany, the examples include denial of the Holocaust and newer forms of antisemitism targeting Israel. such as demonizing the Jewish state, denying its right to exist and holding it to standards not expected of any other democratic state. Experts have argued the definition is important for a range of practical uses such as adjudicating legal cases, monitoring bigotry on campuses and training law enforcement. Mainstream Jewish advocacy groups, such as the American Jewish Committee and Jewish Federations of North America, have pushed for the administration to adopt IHRA's definition.

Progressive groups urged the Biden administration to leave out a definition of antisemitism entirely or consider alternative definitions. The Nexus Document, written by a group of academics, argues that applying double standards to Israel and opposing Israel's continuation as the nation-state of the Jewish people may not necessarily be antisemitic, creating tighter standards around when anti-Israel speech and activity is antisemitic. The White House's strategy identifies some forms of anti-Israel rhetoric and activity that can cross the line into antisemitism. \"Jewish students and educators are targeted for derision and exclusion on college campuses, often because of their real or perceived views about the State of Israel,\" the strategy says. \"When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or their identity, when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism. And that is unacceptable.\" The strategy also pledges to \"combat antisemitism abroad and in international fora — including efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel.\" It also notes the administration's \"unshakeable commitment to the state of Israel's right to exist, its legitimacy, and its security\" and the \"deep historical, religious, cultural, and other ties many American Jews and other Americans have to Israel.\" Proponents of the IHRA definition expressed satisfaction with the president's strategy. Jewish Federations of North America Chair Julie Platt, for example, said the organization is \"pleased that the White House reaffirms\" the IHRA definition. Dianne Lob and William Daroff, the chair and CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, similarly said they \"wholeheartedly applaud the Biden administration's continuing embrace of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism.\" Meanwhile, left-wing advocacy groups critical of IHRA's definition praised the White House. \"Importantly, the strategy avoids exclusively codifying any one specific, sweeping definition of antisemitism as the sole standard for use in enforcing domestic law and policy, recognizing that such an approach could do more harm than good,\" J Street said in a statement, adding that the administration \"rightly cites [the IHRA] definition as just one of a range of illustrative and useful tools.\" A makeshift memorial outside the Tree of Life Synagogue in the aftermath of a deadly shooting in Pittsburgh Oct. 29, 2018. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) ORTHODOX JEWISH GROUP TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER NYT DENIED PULITZER, HAILS PUSHBACK AGAINST PAPER'S ALLEGED BIAS The progressive group Bend the Arc said it was \"pleased that the Biden administration has rejected the idea that government agencies should adopt the IHRA definition as authoritative policy or that it is the sole guide to antisemitism.\" Other Jewish groups were less supportive. \"This decision seriously weakens the White House strategy. It is yet another instance of Biden caving to the anti-Israel radicals,\" said Republican Jewish Coalition CEO Matt Brooks, who added that Biden \"blew it\" by not exclusively using IHRA's definition. He also noted the timing of the announcement — hours before the start of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and near the end of Jewish American Heritage Month. Dan Pollak, director of government relations for the Zionist Organization of America, also said he was \"disappointed\" in the Biden administration, arguing the Nexus Document \"gives a free pass to Jew-Haters who single out Israel.\" Critics of the strategy also noted the White House's inclusion of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, as a partner in building \"cross-community solidarity\" to combat antisemitism. According to the Anti-Defamation League, \"Some of CAIR’s current leadership had early connections with organizations that are or were affiliated with Hamas.\" CAIR disputes the accuracy of the ADL’s claim and asserts that CAIR \"unequivocally condemn[s] all acts of terrorism, whether carried out by al-Qa’ida, the Real IRA, FARC, Hamas, ETA, or any other group designated by the U.S. Department of State as a ‘Foreign Terrorist Organization.'\" Several headstones at the Am Echod Cemetery in Waukegan, Ill. were vandalized with antisemitic grafitti. (WFLD Chicago) DERSHOWITZ: ZIONIST AND CONSERVATIVE STUDENTS ARE 'TERRIFIED TO EXPRESS VIEWS ON CAMPUS' In December, more than 100 lawmakers sent a letter to Biden urging him to form a national strategy to combat antisemitism and address threats and violence against Jewish communities. That some month, Biden established a government task force to coordinate efforts to fight antisemitism and other forms of religious bigotry. The group's first task was to create a national strategy to counter antisemitism. The new White House strategy comes as levels of antisemitism are at historic highs in the country. Jews are the victims of 63% of reported religiously motivated hate crimes but account for just 2.4% of the U.S. population, according to FBI data. Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League found that antisemitic incidents reported in the U.S. surged to historic levels last year, increasing 36% compared to 2021. Earlier this week, a man with a Nazi flag crashed a U-Haul truck into a security barrier at the White House, according to police. Court documents reportedly say the suspect praised Adolf Hitler after his arrest and said that he aimed to \"kill the president\" if necessary to overthrow the government and install himself in power.

The story has been updated to more clearly reflect the ADL's characterization of CAIR, and CAIR's response to the ADL's characterization has been added.

       "Iran building nuclear facility deep enough that US bombs would likely be incapable of destroying it: Report  Michael Lee                 2023-05-22  News        Exiled Crown Prince of Iran Reza Pahlavi joined ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ to discuss the growing influence of Iran’s revolutionary guard as former U.S. diplomats call on Biden to cease all diplomacy. Iran is building a nuclear facility so deep underground that experts fear conventional U.S. weapons would be unable to destroy it. \"So the depth of the facility is a concern because it would be much harder for us. It would be much harder to destroy using conventional weapons, such as like a typical bunker buster bomb,\" Steven De La Fuente, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, told The Associated Press in a report Monday. The comments come after satellite imagery, taken in April by Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by the AP, show workers digging tunnels near a peak of the Zagros Mountains in central Iran close to the Natanz nuclear site, a site long watched by international nuclear observers that has come under repeated sabotage attacks Iran has blamed on Israel. The satellite imagery of the site, which is protected by fencing, anti-aircraft batteries, and Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, shows four entrances being dug into the mountainside. Analysts are able to estimate the depth of the entrances by looking at the size of the spoil piles and other satellite data, which they say now indicated the facility is at depths of 260 and 328 feet.

(AP Photo/Lisa Leutner, file) Iran completing such a facility \"would be a nightmare scenario that risks igniting a new escalatory spiral,\" Kelsey Davenport, the director of nonproliferation policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association, told The Associated Press. \"Given how close Iran is to a bomb, it has very little room to ratchet up its program without tripping U.S. and Israeli red lines. So at this point, any further escalation increases the risk of conflict,\" Davenport said.

(Iranian Leaders Press Office - Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) IRAN GAINS FOOTHOLD IN SOUTH AMERICA AS BIDEN ADMIN PURSUES NUCLEAR DEAL Iran has been inching dangerously closer to the ability to make nuclear weapons since the U.S. abandoned a deal struck with the country under former President Obama, saying it is now enriching uranium up to 60%. Under the terms of the previous agreement, Iran was prohibited enriching uranium above 3.67% purity. President Biden has made rekindling the nuclear deal with Iran a primary objective of his administration's foreign policy, though those talks have stalled in recent months. President Joe Biden. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) While Iran has acknowledged enriching uranium up to 60%, inspectors have discovered the country has produced uranium particles that were 83.7% pure, just short of the 90% threshold of weapons-grade uranium. However, Iran has denied it is seeking to build nuclear weapons, with Iranian officials telling the AP that \"Iran’s peaceful nuclear activities are transparent and under the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP FILE: Iran's domestically built centrifuges are displayed in an exhibition of the country's nuclear achievements, in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2023.  (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) Despite the claim, the country has limited the ability for international nuclear inspectors to inspect sites for years. Meanwhile, experts fear attempts to sabotage Iran's nuclear program may only work to drive it further underground. \"Sabotage may roll back Iran’s nuclear program in the short-term, but it is not a viable, long-term strategy for guarding against a nuclear-armed Iran,\" Davenport said. \"Driving Iran’s nuclear program further underground increases the proliferation risk.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

       "Israel more than doubled strikes on Iranian targets in Syria, defense minister claims                        Associated Press            2023-05-22  Israel      Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Israel's defense minister Monday said that Israel's new government has greatly increased the number of strikes on Iranian targets since taking office late last year. Yoav Gallant did not provide an exact number of airstrikes. But the address, delivered at a security conference, marked rare public comments on Israeli military activity in Syria. \"Since I took office, the number of Israeli strikes against the Iranians in Syria have doubled,\" Gallant said. IRAN BUILDING NUCLEAR FACILITY DEEP ENOUGH THAT US BOMBS WOULD LIKELY BE INCAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT: REPORT \"As part of this campaign, we are working methodically to strike the Iranian intelligence capabilities in Syria,\" he said. \"These strikes inflict significant damage to the attempts by the Revolutionary Guard to establish a foothold a few kilometers from the Israeli border.\" Israel has reportedly more than doubled the number of airstrikes carried out against Iranian targets in Syria. Gallant also accused Iran of converting civilian ships into military vessels armed with weapons such as drones, missiles and intelligence-gathering capabilities. He said Iran hopes to station these ships at long distances from Iran. GAZA MILITANTS, ISRAEL EXCHANGE MORE AIRSTRIKES IN MOST VIOLENT CONFLICT IN MONTHS DESPITE CEASE-FIRE EFFORTS \"Iran aims to expand its reach to the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and even the shores of the Mediterranean,\" he said. \"This is a structured plan designed to threaten trade and flight routes — both military and civilian — and to create a permanent threat in the maritime arena.\" Israel considers Iran to be its greatest enemy, citing its calls for Israel's destruction and its support for anti-Israel militant groups across the region. It also accuses Iran of trying to develop a nuclear bomb — a charge Iran denies.

The top official in the Israeli Defense Forces warned that Jerusalem, along with its allies, has the ability to strike Iran as Tehran continues to develop its nuclear program at a concerning rate. \"Iran has made more progress in enriching uranium than ever before,\" Israeli Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said at a conference Tuesday. \"We are also closely examining the other areas on the way to nuclear capability. \"Without going into details, there are possible negative developments on the horizon that could prompt action,\" he continued. \"We have abilities, and others have abilities. We have the ability to hit Iran,\" he said during his speech at the Herzliya Conference 2023, Institute for Policy and Strategy at Reichman University in Israel.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also revealed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are turning civilian merchant ships into military vessels armed with UAVs, missile systems and advanced intelligence-gathering units and using them as \"floating terrorist bases.\" \"Iran conducts itself like a collection of criminal organizations, not a modern state,\" Gallant told conference attendees at Reichman University, Monday. \"The floating terror bases are an extension of Iran's ongoing maritime terrorism, as seen in its actions in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.\" Gallant also noted that the ships are intended to be used at sea for extended periods of time.

Shamkhani has faced allegations of corruption after he was accused of having close ties to a British Iranian man who was hung earlier this year on charges of spying. He has denied all corruption allegations. Iran's domestically built centrifuges are displayed in an exhibition of the country's nuclear achievements, in Tehran, Feb. 8, 2023.

departure is the latest in a recent series of musical chairs in Iran that in the aggregate represents ultra-hardline consolidation.\" \"Shamkhani was the second-longest serving chair of Iran’s SNSC and the Islamic Republic’s highest-ranking ethnic Arab,\" he added. \"The personnel change is likely to beget greater domestic consensus in Iran for escalation and confrontation.\" Caitlin McFall is a

       "Government Tests Pollution Clouds, Chemtrails as Means of Weather Control                                    Justin Birch                2015-03-17  News          WASHINGTON, D.C. – The first in a series of tests for a previously classified government project took place over the past month. Codenamed “Project Overcast,” this latest innovation in science attempts to give some control over Mother Nature’s unpredictable weather. For this long-term test, scientists deployed several large vehicles to the deserts of Nevada which filled the air with heavy pollution clouds and chemtrails. The goal was to create artificial cloud cover that would drop the temperature over a long period of time. The results were, in lead scientist Harrison’s words, “Pretty sweet.” Temperatures dropped as much as 20 degrees in the first week, with the added side effect of blotting out the sun. “Obviously we were testing this for human use, but it was a great sight to see the creatures of the desert get a break from the sun and heat for a while. They all cuddled together and a few went to sleep for a really long time. It was cute,” Harrison said. According to the follow-up report, the test was almost too successful – the clouds lingered much longer than expected. So long, in fact, that “any longer and it would have started snowing,” Harrison said. The team is still investigating reports of the pollution clouds causing health problems to fauna in the area, as well as drifting to nearby cities and reducing their overall air quality by substantial amounts. “Who cares about silly things like air quality? This is exciting!” Harrison said when asked about the blown-over clouds. Government projections show this technology ready to use on a wide scale by 2017, bringing climate control to the rest of the United States. comments

       "Government To Increase Hunting Law Age To 21                                                                 Bob The Empire News Potato  2016-09-30  Politics     WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an effort to curb the use of guns by minors and children, the government has decided to increase the legal hunting age for all animals to 21 beginning in 2017. The change, they hope, will keep guns out of hands of younger and younger kids who are “getting a feel” for weaponry too early. “After shootings at multiple schools, including a recent one where a teenager shot and killed students at an elementary school, this change in the law was a no-brainer,” said Mark Scott, a Republican Senator. “We hope to keep guns out of the hands of young children, in hopes that as they grow up, they will be less inclined to have anything to do with high-powered weaponry.” Currently, the lowest age allowed for hunting anywhere in the United States is 8-years-old in states like New Hampshire and Maine, where children can use rifles and bows for hunting. Sidearms and pistols are already regulated to those 21 and older. “This law will help to curb gun violence perpetrated by children. If they’re not exposed to guns, they’ll be less prone to violence and killing, and that can save lives.” comments

       "Government To Reduce Food Stamp Allowance Of Overweight Recipients                                           Raoul Stockton              2014-12-29  Government  WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which Americans commonly refer to as the ‘Food Stamp Program’, has voted to reduce the monthly allowance of obese welfare recipients, according to body weight according to SNAP spokesperson Winston C. Douglas in an announcement earlier today. Douglas said that after a vote was brought to the SNAP board of directors, that the group voted unanimously in support of the proposed measure in an attempt to fight obesity in the United States. “An alarming statistic was brought to the board which stated that over fifty-percent of SNAP benefit recipients are grossly overweight, many of which are clinically considered obese. This, of course is major cause for concern with how the program is operated” Douglas said. All SNAP recipients, including all who live in the household, will be ordered to take a physical as part of the new plan. Depending on results, funding could be drastically reduced for those who are overweight. A measure many suggest is long overdue, including New Jersey governor Chris Christie. “I have to work in order to overeat,” the hefty governor said when asked about the new measure. “It’s a problem when the government is giving people money to sit on their lazy butts and just eat all day. It is about time something is done about this plague of people abusing the accessibility of welfare benefits.” There are also those who think it is highly inappropriate to require welfare recipients to take a physical in order to receive their monthly allowance, such as Shantae Johnson, 32, of Cleveland, Ohio. “Who the hell they think they are? Just because we poor means we can’t be fat? I think it’s wrong, and we deserve to get what is owed to us no matter how we look! People pay taxes for us to have that money to get whatever food we damn well please,” Johnson said angrily. “This is an outrage and we not gonna put up with the harassment! I don’t see them harassing rich people who are fat!” comments

       "Government, Health Department Says Ebola Turns Earthworms Into Real Life ‘Tremors’                           Chip                        2014-11-23  News        WASHINGTON, D.C. – An emergency press release was conducted by the Health Department warning all government officials to refrain from burying the bodies of future Ebola victims. According to Health Department Spokesperson Elliot Tevere, though the effects of Ebola on earthworms is unknown, the Health Department has reason to believe that the Ebola virus is capable of turning even the smallest earthworm into an enormous worm, or Tremor. According to Trevere, the Health Department has compiled mountains of compelling data in support of their theory, however at this time are not willing to share the data with the public. “We are not at liberty to share the results of our findings; however top scientists have been working feverishly in the lab. They have been conducting high level tests,” said Trevere. “The general public is just not ready to know the details surrounding the tests.” The word Tremor stems from a popular movie franchise in which small towns are infiltrated by enormous worm-like monsters that live underground.  The first feature in the 4 movie franchise was entitled Tremors, and was released in 1990. An anchor from a local Los Angeles FOX affiliate station had the opportunity to sit down with original Tremors cast member Kevin Bacon, and asked him the likelihood of the Ebola Virus morphing earthworms to creatures similar to those found in his hit 1990 movie.  Kevin responded to the question by saying “Your question in itself is absurd, are you really asking me if I believe the Ebola virus can create monsters similar to those featured in a pretend movie? C’mon.” Actor Michael Gross, who unlike Bacon has starred in all 4 Tremors movies and is slated to play a role in Tremors 5, scheduled for release in 2016, shared a different opinion on the matter when he sat down with a MSNBC representative earlier this afternoon. When Gross was asked a similar question regarding the likelihood of the Ebola virus causing earthworms to morph into Tremor like monsters he responded by saying “Oh, absolutely! I have no doubt the Health Department’s claims hold their weight in gold. Look, I have completed extensive research, and have enough hands-on experience with shooting 4, almost 5, of these Tremor movies to tell you that this is exactly how these things start.” Gross concluded the interview by saying, “Our saving grace is that technologically our society is far more equipped to handle these motherhumpers than we were in 1990.” comments

       "’50 Shades Of Grey’ Clubs Become Popular Among Experimental Teens                                            Josh Marcus                 2015-03-09  News         LOS ANGELES, California – In a trend sweeping America, teenagers are reportedly starting and joining ‘50 Shades of Grey’ clubs, en masse. The movement began in response to the box office success of the first movie of the franchise. However, it is being suggested that most of these youths have not read the books or seen the film. “I haven’t seen the movie,” said Tuck Harrington, 16. “What I heard about it is pretty cool, and I want to do that with my friends.

It helps stop bullying.” We asked Tuck to take us through some of the activities he and his group perform together. “Well, we started off making friendship bracelets. That’s obviously the easiest way for teens to bondage. We’ve progressed to song nights every Friday, and group trips to mansions to see how successful men like Christian Grey have bondaged to their great advantage.” Catching up with other clubs, we found them to be doing much of the same. Some of their favorite bondage activities included friendly races, short vacations to the coast, as well as study sessions before exams. “This is a system which is doing wonders for our kids,” said Colorado teacher Peter Josselewsky. “They’re working together to create stronger bondage between teens who would usually be fighting – whether in the conventional sense, or with more recent cyber bullying. With these new clubs, we’ve seen a drastic decrease in hostility, and guys who’d usually be outsiders are now part of the in-crowd.” Tuck Harrington agreed with his sentiments. “It’s true. There are some kids who would’ve been called ‘nerds’ or ‘losers’ who are much loved by the group. They’ve found a way to form bondages with others, and that’s something I’ve never seen in all my years of high school.” When asked what his favorite part of the 50 Shades club was, he told us, “Oh, well – on Sunday nights, we all get naked, and half of us tie the other half to chairs or beds, and then we fuck them hard, with all sorts of sex toys and moves we learned online. Then we switch, and let them do the same things to us. I particularly like having a big, rubber fist shoved up my ass while I’m gagged with a pair of panties or a tight gag. It’s definitely the best part of the ’50 Shades’ club.” comments
