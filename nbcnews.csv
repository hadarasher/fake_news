YouTube will stop removing false claims about 2020 election fraud,"Jennifer Elias, CNBC","June 2, 2023, 7:28 PM UTC",Tech News,"Google-owned YouTube will stop removing false claims of widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential race, the video platform announced on Friday. YouTube said in a blog post that it made the decision to balance its twin goals of “protecting our community and providing a home for open discussion and debate.” The decision, which comes ahead of the 2024 election, undoes a policy implemented in December 2020, after President Joe Biden won the election. “Two years, tens of thousands of video removals, and one election cycle later, we recognized it was time to reevaluate the effects of this policy in today’s changed landscape,” YouTube wrote. “In the current environment, we find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, it could also have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.” The new rule will go into effect on Friday. In the 2020 elections, the company faced backlash for delayed action when it came to labeling and removing videos that showed misinformation or that falsely claimed widespread voter fraud. After the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, YouTube said it would begin suspending channels that make false claims about widespread voter fraud As of March 2023, YouTube had already lifted restrictions placed on Trump’s account following the Jan. 6 insurrection. YouTube said there are still aspects of its election misinformation policy that remain, including highlighting authoritative sources in search and recommendations and prohibiting posts that aim to mislead voters on where and how to vote.

Immigration backlog has a U.S. asylum-seeker feeling like he's 'imprisoned in a country',"Anagilmara Vilchez, Noticias Telemundo","June 2, 2023, 7:23 PM UTC",Immigration,"MIAMI — Although he's free, the 26-year-old man sometimes feels like he's in a prison. Five years ago, he went into exile in the U.S. after leaving his home country of Nicaragua, and he began a political asylum process that has not advanced. He's been told he has to keep details of his ordeal fresh since it's key to winning his asylum case, but since his application hasn't progressed, he said he can't move on — and can't heal from what he left behind. “It’s like writing in a notebook everything that hurt you and all the things you don’t want to remember,” said the young man, whose name is being withheld for fear security reasons. There are almost 1.6 million asylum-seekers waiting for an asylum hearing in the U.S., according to 2022 data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, at Syracuse University in New York. “It’s worrying, time is passing and you see that you haven’t done anything, that you’re not moving forward,” the asylum-seeker told Noticias Telemundo. “They have your hands tied.” Attorneys with private and pro bono practices are overloaded with unresolved cases for years, a problem that inhibits them from taking on new clients and harms those they already have, explained experts, who say that the immigration system has not been able to adapt to the current migratory flow. “It’s hard for us to expand our services and take on more clients because we can’t close any of our cases,” said Rachel Kafele,   director of programs for Oasis Legal Services, a nonprofit organization that offers free legal advice and support to immigrants from the LGBTQ community in California and parts of Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Oasis has a three-month waitlist for new cases because more than 800 of its clients haven't gotten an appointment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “We have clients who applied for asylum in 2014 and are still waiting for their interview,"" Kafele said. “The United States (immigration) system was designed in 1965 and has not been reformed since then,” Raquel Aldana, lawyer and law professor at the University of California, Davis, told Noticias Telemundo. “We talk about asylum and how the system is overwhelmed, but each year we barely grant 20,000 to 25,000 asylum claims to people. ... That is nothing,” Aldana said. “Perhaps the problem is not the migratory flow. It is that the law itself does not respond to the reality.” “Everything will continue to get worse as long as there is no immigration reform, one that really changes the entire system,” Tahimí Rengifo, an immigration attorney who practices in Miami, said. “(The system) is designed for the needs of that time, not for the current time and current situations.” According to TRAC, current figures represent the highest total number of pending asylum applications on record. According to Amy Grenier, policy and practice adviser for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the situation has been exacerbated by a combination of factors and bureaucratic inefficiencies as well as previous policies under the Trump administration — including ""incentivizing unnecessary (application) denials and a hiring freeze"" of personnel — as well as delays dragged on since the pandemic, when offices and courts closed for several months. “Immigration agencies are really bad at communicating and coordinating,” Grenier said. Procedures that should be simple, she said, such as a change of address, are cumbersome as they have to be carried out separately in each instance. The average wait time for a case before an immigration court is 1,572 days — that is, 4.3 years — from the time the process reaches the court and until it receives a hearing, TRAC detailed. “I think it’s hard for immigration attorneys to have to prepare a case multiple times,” Grenier said, explaining attorneys first have to present the asylum application, then prepare for a hearing — which is often canceled and rescheduled at the last minute — and finally prepare again when a new date is assigned. “It is also hard for the asylum-seeker; who wants to live with this uncertainty for years?” she said. The measure known as Last In, First Out, applied by the Trump administration and which is still in force, establishes that those who have just entered the country will have priority to be heard, something that doesn't benefit newcomers or those who have been waiting for years. It was implemented amid the rise of migrants coming to the U.S. seeking asylum, and the practice allows the government to deport people more quickly if they're deemed ineligible for asylum. Appointments for a hearing are granted so quickly that immigrants have very little time to get evidence or a lawyer to represent them, according to Rengifo. “They don’t have enough time and the lawyer doesn’t have any control” over when an appointment is scheduled, she said. Grenier said attorneys are declining to take cases for two reasons, “because the time frame is too fast, such as in expedited removal, and because it’s too slow in immigration court."" Lorena Duarte, an immigration lawyer in Miami, said that since she founded her firm almost three years ago, “all my cases have been of people who have recently arrived and those cases have moved faster. I have certain cases that want to be adjudicated after one year or two years.” She has also answered queries from people who came to the country with a visa and “have been waiting five, six, seven years (for an appointment) and the only solution is to sue the government in federal court, but many people don’t want to do that,” she said. While this is an outlet for solid asylum cases that have plenty of evidence, “they are going to give you the interview, but under what circumstances? Now you are the person who sued them federally; it's a double-edged sword,” Rengifo said. According to the Nicaraguan still waiting to have his asylum request processed, he's seen friends, relatives and acquaintances arrive after him and have their cases advance while he remains stuck in a migratory limbo. “I am happy for them because they did not have to suffer what one suffers, the uncertainty, but the truth must be told — it is injustice due to the system,” he said. The asylum-seeker said that while he fled to come to the U.S. to live in peace, that's not the case. Although he has a work permit and a Social Security number, he lives in uncertainty about his immigration status. “You are imprisoned in a country. ... It doesn’t really help you heal,"" the young Nicaraguan said. His “asylum-seeker” status, which is not the same as someone with asylum, also limits his access to public loans to continue studying, for example. With the passage of time, another possibility lurks: that the circumstances in the applicant’s country of origin change and “what is a judge going to say to you? 'The evil that you experienced, what you lived through, has already changed, so you can return to your country now,' and what happens? You lost years trying to build your life in the United States, when in reality they are going to make you return,” the Nicaraguan said. Many immigrants complete their paperwork without the advice of a lawyer. One in 10 asylum-seekers were unrepresented in cases resolved in fiscal year 2022, and among pending asylum cases, “one in five (21%) are registered as unrepresented,” according to TRAC. While there's a need for attorneys, it's hard for immigrants to get them, Grenier said, even though in asylum cases there's no equivalent to a public defender paid by the state, as there is in criminal cases. Yet “for someone seeking asylum and facing death if returned to their country, the stakes are just as high,” Kafele said. An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo. "
GOP requires pledge to back nominee for first presidential debate,Ben Kamisar,"June 2, 2023, 7:19 PM UTC",2024 Election,"The Republican National Committee is requiring presidential hopefuls to pledge to support the party's eventual nominee if they want to participate in the GOP's first primary debate in Milwaukee on Aug. 23. The pledge comes as a handful of Republican presidential hopefuls have hedged whether they would support former President Donald Trump if he wins the party's presidential nomination. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is set to announce his presidential bid next week, told Axios earlier this year that he could never support Trump again. Other potential Republican candidates, like New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have gone a different route: Sununu argued that while he will back the nominee, Trump won't be that person next year. And Trump himself hasn't said if he'd sign such a pledge: ""There are probably people that I wouldn't be very happy about endorsing who are running, so we'll see,"" he said in March. NBC News has also reported that Trump is considering skipping the first Republican debates. Republicans will hold their first presidential primary debate in Wisconsin in late August. The field will meet on Aug. 23, and if enough candidates have qualified, the RNC will add another event on Aug. 24. Early Democratic debates in 2019 and Republican debates in 2015 split candidates up over multiple days because of the size of the field. On top of pledging to support the nominee, the party also wants candidates to meet a series of polling and fundraising thresholds and to pledge not to participate in any non-RNC-sponsored debate. Last year, the RNC voted to require its candidates not to join general election debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has run general election presidential debates for decades, through the 2020 race between Trump and Joe Biden. Would-be Republican presidential debaters will also need to meet broad polling requirements, hitting at least 1% in three qualifying national polls conducted after July 1 — or in two national polls plus one poll from Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina. The RNC did not identify a list of sanctioned pollsters, instead releasing broad methodological criteria it would accept in qualifying polls. Two of the criteria: a sample size of at least 800 registered likely Republican voters and results that were not ""overly"" weighted. The sample size could be an important issue: Relatively few pollsters — including many of the firms that partner with media organizations — contact that many respondents in primary polls, in part because of the high costs associated with calling people by phone. For example, NBC News' last poll in August surveyed 1,000 registered voters overall. Republican candidates will also need to raise money from a minimum of 40,000 unique donors, including 200 unique donors from at least 20 states and territories, according to the newly released RNC criteria. Setting donor thresholds isn't new, as Democrats included a similar requirement for their debates in the 2020 election cycle. But during the first Democratic debate in 2019, candidates could qualify either through polling or by crossing a fundraising threshold. Republicans, this time, are requiring their candidates hit both. Ahead of the Democratic Party's first debate in 2019, the party said that 14 of its candidates had hit both the party's 65,000 unique donor threshold and its polling threshold in time for that debate.

Report finds more than 340 migrant kids were sent to live with nonrelatives who sponsored other children,Laura Strickler,"June 2, 2023, 6:59 PM UTC",Immigration,"The Biden administration released 344 unaccompanied migrant children to live with nonfamily sponsors hosting three or more unaccompanied kids, says a new Health and Human Services Department audit, raising questions among advocates who worry that some minors are being sponsored by strangers who could exploit them for child labor. The audit, conducted by the agency’s Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the care and release of unaccompanied minors, also showed that the number who were placed with distant relatives or nonfamily sponsors increased from 2021 to 2022, both in real terms and as a percentage of all unaccompanied minors. “We see in our own work that some kids are placed into settings where they may not know the person and they are treated as a second-class citizen in the family and under pressure to work,” said Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, who advocates for unaccompanied migrant children. When migrants under 18 arrive in the U.S. alone and are processed by HHS and released inside the U.S., they must be transferred into the custody of an approved sponsor, who is usually but not always a family member. The total number of unaccompanied migrant children released by ORR since 2012 is more than 600,000, with more than a third released under the Biden administration, according to HHS figures. In calendar year 2021, the government released 138,917 unaccompanied minors. Of those, 11.8%, or 16,456, were released to distant relatives or nonfamily sponsors. In calendar year 2022, slightly fewer unaccompanied minors were released, at 124,781, but more of them were released to nonfamily sponsors — 18,004 or 14%. The audit found that ORR’s vetting of the nonfamily sponsors was in compliance with guidelines and included the required FBI background checks, sex offender checks, child abuse and neglect registry requests and, in some cases, home studies. Agency officials note that the number of children released to nonfamily members hosting three or more unaccompanied kids is less than 1% of the total number of children released to distant relatives or nonfamily members since the beginning of 2021. “Every one of us owes a child our care and protection, regardless of circumstance and without exception. When it comes to the temporary custody and subsequent placement with vetted sponsors of unaccompanied children, HHS takes its responsibility seriously,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “The audit released today confirms that ORR has worked hard to provide unaccompanied children, especially those who have experienced significant trauma, the care and attention they deserve. ORR works just as hard on its placement and sponsor vetting processes, under which most unaccompanied children are placed in the custody of a parent or close relative."" Said Becerra, ""We will continue to do our part to protect the safety and well-being of unaccompanied children, including coordinating with the Department of Labor and other partners to further crack down on child labor. We expect employers and companies to do their part and follow the law regarding child labor.” ORR has come under increased scrutiny in the wake of reports that child labor exploitation is on the rise, including a Labor Department investigation that found more than 100 children — many of them unaccompanied minors from Guatemala — were employed cleaning Midwestern slaughterhouses. Labor officials say since 2018 there has been a 69% increase in the number of children employed in violation of labor laws. In March 2021, when ORR was struggling to handle an influx of unaccompanied children, the agency issued new guidance prioritizing the expedited placement of unaccompanied children to limit their time in ORR care. Critics say those changes reduced scrutiny on sponsors who could exploit children for labor. ORR examined a subset of more than 34,000 children who were released to distant relatives or nonrelative sponsors and analyzed the vetting of sponsors for the 344 children who were placed with sponsors hosting three or more unaccompanied kids. Immigrant advocates say sponsors of this kind could be a red flag for child labor trafficking. Young told NBC News that while she wasn’t surprised by the number of unaccompanied children released to nonrelatives, those releases require the most oversight. “We are seeing too many concerning examples of where that process is failing,"" she said. ""The most extreme is that there is evidence they have been releasing them to exploitative labor situations.” Monica Meier, who runs the social work program for the Immigrant Legal Center in Nebraska, said her team has served more than 1,300 unaccompanied migrant children who have come to Nebraska since 2021. She says most are placed with family members so that a nonfamily sponsor housing three or more kids would be a red flag. Meier said the unaccompanied children want to work and are vulnerable to labor trafficking. “They don’t know that if you are 12 that you should not be working overnight at a meatpacking plant with dangerous chemicals, and so that allows for a situation where they are going to do what they can to make money and people will exploit them."" The HHS audit did not break down where in the country the 344 children were released. ORR makes at least three attempts to contact the child and sponsor 30 days after the child is released to the sponsor’s care to follow up. But in 46 of the 344 cases, neither child nor sponsor was reached, according to the audit. HHS maintains it reaches the child, the sponsor or both in more than 80% of cases. Auditors also scrutinized 172 of the 344 cases in depth. Of those cases 12 children were found to have run away and 12 more were referred to child protective services. HHS says it will launch an Innovation and Accountability team within the ORR director’s office to “focus on identifying and mitigating opportunities for potential fraud, abuse, and exploitation” among unaccompanied migrant children in the next four months. The agency entered into a new memorandum of understanding with the Labor Department in March formalizing information sharing between the two agencies to address growing concerns about unaccompanied children working illegally. Labor and HHS officials have been under pressure to disclose any links between the rise in child labor and the release of unaccompanied children. In a letter last week GOP members of Congress on the House Education and Workforce Committee pressed Labor Department officials to disclose the number of children who were under the care of HHS who have been identified as victims of child labor. The HHS Office of Inspector General is also evaluating how ORR vets sponsors for unaccompanied minors, with a report expected this summer, according to an agency spokesperson. "
FBI to show House Oversight leaders document in Biden probe on Monday,Rose Horowitch,"June 2, 2023, 4:49 PM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 6:11 PM UTC",Congress,"The FBI will let the chair and ranking member of the House Oversight Committee review a document describing an allegation that Joe Biden accepted a bribe as vice president, but will black out information that could reveal the source’s identity, a senior law enforcement official said. Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., subpoenaed the FBI last month for the FD-1023 form, which he and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, claimed describes an alleged criminal scheme involving Biden “relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions.” Comer has said the scheme involved a $5 million payment from a foreign national in exchange for a policy outcome. The agency will bring the document to Capitol Hill on Monday and offer a briefing to Comer and ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a committee spokesperson said. Initially, the FBI had asked the lawmakers to review the document at FBI headquarters. The senior law enforcement official told NBC News that the FBI and a U.S. attorney appointed by then-President Donald Trump reviewed the allegation when it was made in 2020, along with other information about Biden’s son Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine. The bribery allegation was not substantiated, the official said. Former Attorney General William Barr had asked the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh to investigate the Biden Ukraine matter. Grassley, who is also seeking the document, said this week that Republicans “aren’t interested in whether or not the accusations against Biden are accurate or not,” but rather want to make sure the FBI complies with the subpoena. Christopher Durham, acting assistant director of the FBI, warned in a letter to Comer this week that FD-1023 forms record information told to the FBI, but recording the information ""does not validate the information, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI."" “Investigative reports, such as an FD-1023, include leads and suspicions, not the conclusions of investigators based on fuller context, including information that may not be available to the confidential source,” Dunham wrote. The FBI has also expressed concerns that turning over the document could risk the life of the source. Republicans have said they are not interested in the informant’s identity, but the subpoena demands the document in full. The FBI said in a statement Friday that it had requested ""commonsense protections"" to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information. Such requests are routinely made by the agency when responding to congressional requests as well as in criminal court proceedings ""to protect the physical safety of sources and the integrity of investigations,"" the agency said, adding that it ""remains committed to cooperating with the Committee in good faith."" News of the briefing Monday was first reported by Fox News. After Comer issued the subpoena to FBI Director Christopher Wray for the document last month, the FBI declined to provide it, saying it had to adhere to Justice Department policy, which limits how confidential human source information can be distributed outside of the FBI. Comer then said the committee would move to hold Wray in contempt of Congress unless he turned over the document. Following a phone call with Comer, Grassley and Wray on Wednesday, the FBI said Wray had offered to allow the leaders of the committee to review the document ""in a secure manner."" Raskin has accepted the FBI's invitation to review the subpoenaed document, a spokesperson said. ""The Ranking Member appreciates the agency’s efforts to accommodate the Committee and the opportunity to review and be briefed on the Trump Justice Department’s follow up on the unsubstantiated tip sheet after weeks of Chairman Comer’s partisan spin,"" the Raskin spokesperson added. A spokesperson for the Oversight Committee said that the upcoming briefing and review of the document will not dissuade Comer from moving forward with contempt proceedings against Wray. “Chairman Comer has been clear that anything short of producing the FD-1023 form to the House Oversight Committee is not compliance with his subpoena,” the spokesperson said. House Republicans leading key committees have pursued a series of investigations into the Biden family's business dealings since they took over the chamber earlier this year. The White House has criticized the investigations, arguing the probes are politically motivated and designed to hurt Biden's re-election chances. "
Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester readies run for open Delaware Senate seat,Ali Vitali,"June 2, 2023, 4:49 PM UTC",2024 Election,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., the state's sole House member, is preparing to launch a bid this month for Delaware's open Senate seat, an adviser to the congresswoman said. Blunt Rochester is broadly seen as the favorite to fill the seat vacated by her longtime mentor, Sen. Tom Carper. He announced last month that he would not seek re-election after four terms in the Senate. In announcing his retirement, he named Blunt Rochester as the person he would like to succeed him. Blunt Rochester previously told NBC News that she was “interested” in the seat. “For me, I usually have a process of: I think about it, I pray about it and then I plan,” Blunt Rochester said in a late May interview. Blunt Rochester became the first woman and the first Black person to represent Delaware in Congress when she was elected to a House seat in 2016. If elected to the Senate, she would be the third Black woman to ever serve in the chamber. Politico was the first to report that Blunt Rochester would launch her Senate bid in June. Delaware is a Democratic stronghold that hasn't elected a Republican to statewide office since 2018. Blunt Rochester, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is slightly more left-leaning than Carper. But she is also a long-standing supporter of President Joe Biden, who also served as senator for the state. She serves as a national co-chair of Biden’s re-election campaign and has said she hopes to have Biden’s endorsement if she runs for the Senate seat. Democratic leaders have already coalesced around Blunt Rochester, though she has not yet announced her candidacy. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called Rochester shortly after Carper’s announcement to say “he believes she could be a really good senator” and that he “looks forward to sitting down with her soon,” a spokesperson for Schumer said. Blunt Rochester previously interned for Carper and served as state labor secretary when he was governor of Delaware. In announcing his retirement, Carper said it was time for Blunt Rochester to take the reins. “I spoke with her this morning. I said, ‘You’ve been patiently waiting for me to get out of the way, and I’m going to get out of the way. And I hope you will run, and I hope you’ll let me support you in that mission.’ And she said, ‘Yes, I will let you support me.’” "
CIA Director Bill Burns took a secret trip to China in May,Andrea Mitchell,"June 2, 2023, 4:11 PM UTC",National Security,"WASHINGTON — CIA Director William Burns visited Beijing last month, his first trip to China since becoming the head of the intelligence agency for the Biden administration, a U.S. official familiar with the visit told NBC News. Burns went to Beijing to meet with his Chinese counterparts ""to emphasize the importance of maintaining open lines of communication and intelligence channels,"" the official said. The visit was first reported by the Financial Times. The CIA director was in China after Beijing had broken off most regular calls between senior diplomatic, intelligence and military officials in the aftermath of the U.S. shootdown of a Chinese spy balloon in early February. The Biden administration has attempted to restart high-level talks between the U.S. and China in recent weeks. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, for example, met with China’s most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, for several hours over two days on May 11-12. Days earlier, the U.S. ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing. And Xie Feng, Beijing’s new ambassador to Washington, arrived in the U.S. just last week to take up a position that had been vacant for four months. President Joe Biden recently predicted a ""thaw very soon"" between Washington and Beijing during the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, during which the members of the group of leading industrialized nations expressed plans to cooperate with China economically but act tougher in areas such as human rights, Taiwan and Beijing's aggression in the South China Sea. Tensions between the U.S. and China escalated after the balloon incident earlier this year. State Department officials have been waiting to reschedule a trip to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken that had been postponed because of the incident. Meanwhile, a call between Biden and President Xi Jinping that Biden said in February would happen “soon” has still not taken place. "
Some trans people turn to crowdfunding to leave Florida after anti-LGBTQ laws,Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 3:06 PM UTC",OUT News,"Dozens of transgender people in Florida have turned to crowdfunding appeals to help them leave the state after the passage of new legislation that targets the LGBTQ community, including a law that curtails access to gender-affirming care for adults and bans it for minors. For Sage Chelf, the decision to leave hardly felt like a choice, but she didn’t have the funds to cover a move. The 30-year-old trans woman, who lives in the Orlando area, was nearly out of one medication when she found out the clinic that had been prescribing her hormone therapy was ending all treatment for trans patients. “I don’t want to go back to the person that I was forced to be at the time,” Chelf said, of the years before she transitioned in 2021. “It was a very dark time in my life. I would rather just not be alive, I guess, then have to go back to living not trans.” Chelf was among dozens who made an appeal for donations online, saying they needed help to leave Florida in anticipation of or in reaction to a law that took effect May 17. In addition to banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors, the law places new restrictions on adults seeking treatment. The number of people seeking help online is a fraction of the 94,900 transgender adults estimated to live in Florida by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, which looked at state-level, population-based surveys. Many, if not most, will stay. Not all trans people seek medical interventions. But for those who do, losing access to hormone therapy, or interrupting other care, can be devastating for their mental health. Over time, they can lose some of the sex characteristics generated by the hormones. Chelf, who works as a leasing agent in Orlando, figured she would need $2,500 to cover the cost of moving and finding a new job. She was stunned to raise more than $3,000 online in less than two weeks. “I was under the impression that no one’s going to actually donate, people are going to think I’m just trying to like, get free money,” she said. People have given $200,000 since January to fundraisers on GoFundMe started by trans people seeking to leave Florida, according to data from the platform. Jalen Drummond, GoFundMe’s director of public affairs, said the online fundraising platform saw a 39% increase from April to May in the number of fundraisers created to help trans people leave the state because of the changing laws. That’s still a pittance in terms of overall charitable giving, but it has a big impact for people like Chelf. Such mutual aid helps make up for the overall underfunding of nonprofits that serve the LGBTQ community. A recent study found that those organizations received 0.13% of the $426 billion in overall charitable giving in 2019, the most recent year that IRS data on donations to tax-exempt organizations was available. One reason for that low figure is that many nonprofits that primarily serve the LGBTQ community are small, grassroots organizations that don’t have a lot of fundraising capacity, said Una Osili, associate director for research and international programs at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. She’s hopeful that the school’s research can be a resource for both donors and nonprofits seeking additional funding. The report does not look at funds exchanged directly between individuals. However, Elise Colomer-Cheadle, development director for Outright International, said it’s likely that the most vulnerable in the LGBTQ community — older people, rural residents, immigrants and trans people — do not have their needs met. “While their movement is the largest it’s ever been historically in the last 55 years, it’s still not big enough to serve all of the needs of this population against the backdrop of a very well-funded and very hateful opposition,” said Colomer-Cheadle, whose organization advocates for the human rights of LGBTQ people and populations around the world. “There’s a sense of: The opposition is out for blood and our lives are at stake,” she said. “And if we don’t step up for ourselves, it’s possible that nobody else will. It’s a very, very scary time.” The Campaign for Southern Equality, which advocates for the LGBTQ community, is providing direct grants of $500 to the families of transgender minors across the South and to transgender adults in Florida. It is close to reaching its goal of raising $250,000 in additional funds to distribute this year, said Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, the organization’s executive director. “We are having folks reach out out-of-the-blue, multiple times a week saying, ‘Hey, never connected with your organization before. I’m hosting a fundraiser for you tomorrow night thousands of miles from here. I’ll send you the money.’ That’s pretty incredible,” Beach-Ferrara said. Chelf hopes to move to Illinois and move in with her girlfriend. The donations to her GoFundMe have restored her faith in humanity. “I think everyone’s aware of how dire the situation actually is,” she said. "
Judge recuses himself from Disney suit against DeSantis and accuses governor of 'rank judge-shopping',Rebecca Shabad,"June 2, 2023, 2:51 PM UTC",Politics News,"A federal judge in Florida overseeing Walt Disney Co.'s lawsuit against GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis recused himself Thursday, saying he has a relative who owns Disney stock and could be affected by the case's outcome. In a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, Judge Mark E. Walker, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, responded to a motion by DeSantis' legal team requesting he remove himself from the case. ""Defendants seek to disqualify me from presiding over this case because, in their view, questions I have asked in previous, related cases raise substantial doubts about my impartiality,"" Walker wrote. Walker, however, said the DeSantis team's motion was ""based on a misapprehension of the law and a misstatement of the facts."" The judge said the motion cited cases ""for their convenient language without acknowledging the chasm between my statements in this case and the conduct at issue in those cases."" DeSantis' lawyers had argued in their motion that comments Walker made in a case on intellectual freedom on college campuses and on the Stop Woke Act, a 2022 law that restricts discussions of race, gender and inequality in business and education, suggested the governor's actions against Disney were retaliatory. The motion, therefore, is ""wholly without merit,"" Walker wrote in the filing Thursday. ""I find the motion is nothing more than rank judge-shopping. Sadly, this practice has become all too common in this district,"" he said. Walker, however, said that he had determined that he has to disqualify himself from the case because he learned last week ""that a relative within the third degree of relationship owns thirty shares of stock in Plaintiff’s parent corporation, The Walt Disney Company."" He said this could be ""substantially affected by the outcome of this case."" The case has been reassigned to Judge Allen C. Winsor, who was nominated by President Donald Trump. Walt Disney Parks and Resorts filed the lawsuit against DeSantis in late April, alleging a ""targeted campaign of government retaliation"" after the company publicly opposed a state law that critics call ""Don't Say Gay."" The lawsuit stemmed from DeSantis' threat to revoke Walt Disney World's self-governing status. DeSantis has been feuding with Disney, whose special taxing district, formerly known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, had allowed the company to self-govern its operations at the Orlando-based parks for decades. DeSantis moved to take over the district’s operations earlier this year. "
DOJ closes Pence classified documents investigation with no charges,Laura Jarrett,"June 2, 2023, 2:30 PM UTC",News,"Former Vice President Mike Pence will not be charged in the discovery of classified documents at his Indiana home, according to a letter obtained by NBC News. On Thursday, the Justice Department's national security division informed Pence’s attorney that it had closed its investigation and that based on the “results” of that probe, no charges will be filed against the former vice president. Pence was interviewed as part of the DOJ's investigation, along with several aides, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Justice Department declined to comment, but a DOJ official confirmed that the department had sent the letter. The timing of the investigation’s ending is a relief to Pence, as he plans to announce his bid for president next week. Special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into former President Donald Trump’s handling of classified documents could also be reaching a decision point on whether charges will be filed. A Pence adviser told NBC that the former vice president and his team are pleased but not surprised by the investigation’s conclusion. Earlier this year, Pence’s lawyers said that a “small number” of classified materials had been found at the former vice president’s home in Indiana after the FBI discovered classified records were initially discovered at a Washington think tank President Joe Biden used after he was vice president. The FBI later conducted a five-hour voluntary search of Pence’s home, and uncovered another classified document. In the case of Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland named a special counsel — former Justice Department attorney Robert Hur — to lead that investigation, but no special counsel was named in Pence’s case. The exact status of Hur’s probe remains unclear. "
Oregon Democrats vote to fine absent senators amid longest walkout in Legislature's history,Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 12:36 PM UTC",Politics News,"SALEM, Ore. — Oregon Senate Democrats plan to start fining their absent colleagues amid a month-long Republican walkout, a move they hope will pressure boycotting lawmakers to return to the chamber as hundreds of bills languish amid the partisan stalemate. In a procedural move Thursday, Democrats voted to fine senators $325 every time their absence denies the chamber the two-thirds quorum it needs to conduct business. The amount reflects lawmakers’ average daily pay, according to the office of Democratic Senate President Rob Wagner. “Oregonians work for a living every day, and they don’t get paid when they don’t show up,” Wagner said while addressing the Senate. “We have a huge stack of bills sitting right over there on that cart, just waiting for us to take them up, to debate and to vote.” The month-long Republican walkout — the longest-ever in the Oregon Legislature — once again prevented the Senate from reaching a quorum on Thursday. But Democratic Senate Majority Leader Kate Lieber, citing an article in the state constitution, requested that the Senate compel absent members to attend and fine absentees $325 for every day a quorum isn’t reached. Her request was voted on and approved by the other Democrats present on the Senate floor. The article of the Oregon Constitution cited by Democrats states that even if two-thirds of members are not present, “a smaller number may meet ... and compel the attendance of absent members.” Senate Republican Minority Leader Tim Knopp condemned the plan as retaliation. Most Republican senators haven’t shown up for floor sessions since May 3, denying quorum and stalling hundreds of bills, including ones on abortion, gender-affirming care and gun control that have sparked fierce debate in the Legislature. Knopp has said Republicans will only return to the Senate on the last day of the legislative session, June 25, to pass the budget and “bipartisan” bills. Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek said Wednesday that her talks to end the impasse have failed and that Knopp wants the bill on abortion and gender-affirming care to be “substantially amended or dead.” Kotek said negotiating on that measure, which has already passed the House, is not an option. After Republicans staged previous walkouts in 2019, 2020 and 2021, voters last November approved a ballot measure by an almost 70% margin that was supposed to stop walkouts. Lawmakers with 10 or more unexcused absences would be disqualified from reelection in the next term, according to the measure’s title and summary. But the text of the measure says disqualification applies to “the term following the election after the member’s current term is completed.” Republicans are taking that as meaning that boycotters who are up for reelection in 2024 could be candidates, since their current terms end in January 2025 — with the disqualification coming for the 2028 election. Secretary of State spokesperson Ben Morris said the department is seeking a legal opinion from the Oregon Department of Justice and will follow its advice. The Justice Department is currently working on the legal opinion, Roy Kaufmann, spokesperson for Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, said in an email Wednesday. Republican senators are expected to file court challenges if the secretary of state’s elections division bars them from registering as candidates in September. "
The number of migrants crossing the border has hit its lowest point since Biden took office. Here are four reasons there was no post Title 42 surge.,Julia Ainsley,"June 2, 2023, 10:30 AM UTC",Immigration,"The number of migrants illegally crossing the southwest U.S. border is at its lowest point since the start of the Biden administration, with just over 3,000 migrants stopped by Border Patrol each day. The number has plummeted from more than 10,000 daily just three weeks ago, despite widespread predictions of a surge after the end of the Title 42 Covid ban on May 11. And there may also be fewer migrants waiting just across the border to cross. Shortly before Title 42 was lifted, Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz estimated that up to 65,000 migrants were living in shelters and tent cities in Mexico, ready to enter the U.S. While numbers for tent cities were unavailable, the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration said the population of 130-plus shelters in northern Mexico had fallen from above 25,000 on May 19 to just over 20,000 on Monday. What happened? More migrants are using the asylum app: Shelter operators in Tijuana say migrants in their shelters are increasingly turning to the CBP One App, the mobile application to book appointments at U.S. ports of entry to seek asylum. Although the app remains glitchy and hard to use, recent improvements have allowed over 1,000 migrants a day to use it and have a 23-hour window to book appointments and an additional 23 hours to accept, according to a new study by the University of Texas at Austin’s Strauss Center, which conducted a recent survey of asylum procedures across the U.S.-Mexico border. Previously, migrants were quickly shut out of the system when it reached daily capacity, leading to frustration and, in one case, a rush on the port of entry in El Paso, Texas. With more migrants applying to legally present themselves for asylum, fewer are trying to cross illegally. “Consequences”: Customs and Border Protection officials also attribute the slowdown in illegal border crossings to “consequences.” Under Title 42, migrants could repeatedly try to cross the U.S.-Mexico border and face no consequences if they were turned back. After Title 42 ended, migrants who are caught illegally entering the U.S. are charged with a felony if they are deported and caught trying to re-enter the U.S. within five years, a reimposition of an older regulation called Title 8. A CBP official said word of the increased penalties and deportations — of the “consequences” — has reached migrants considering crossing. Other factors that may be keeping the numbers low, however, are more temporary, say U.S. and foreign officials watching global migration patterns. Weather: A Colombian official said fewer migrants have been crossing from Colombia into Panama along the dangerous Darien Gap in recent weeks because of the rainy season, which has made the journey all the more muddy, slick and treacherous. The Colombian official said that as the weather improves, he expects the number of migrants, particularly those from Venezuela, to increase. New asylum restrictions: A Department of Homeland Security official said the agency also attributes the decline to the policy known as asylum ineligibility put in place after the ending of Title 42. Under the new policy, migrants who do not first seek asylum in countries they pass through on the way to the U.S. are deemed ineligible to apply for asylum at the U.S. border, unless they were denied by a country they passed through or they prove they meet a special set of criteria, such as being potential victims of torture if they are deported. But the American Civil Liberties Union has asked a federal judge in the Northern District of California to block the asylum ineligibility policy. The first hearing is set for July 19. The DHS official said that if the judge blocks the policy and prevents the Biden administration from denying asylum to those migrants, the administration may soon see more migrants trying to cross illegally to claim asylum rather than using the CBP One App. Meanwhile, group chats on WhatsApp among migrants hoping to make their way to the U.S. remain active with advice, ads and firsthand accounts about what to expect in a post-Title 42 environment. “Could anyone send me a VPN (Virtual Private Network) that would work to apply from my country?” a person asked in a CBP One WhatsApp group, providing a screenshot of an error message from the app saying they must be in Mexico to ask for an appointment. In another group chat, smugglers also continue to offer their services by way of videos and images vouching for their “success” getting migrants through and around the Darien Gap using boats. “I am not lying to my people. Zero danger. No crossing the jungle. The safest route. We have the best prices,” said a user, sharing a video from a guide named “Manuelito” featuring a group of migrants cheering and donning life jackets as they load onto boats. "
Porn stars vs. parenthood: Ron DeSantis plays the family card against Trump,Natasha Korecki,"June 2, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",2024 Election,"SALIX, Iowa — It has become a bit. In these early days of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ bid for president, Casey DeSantis joins her husband onstage, and the stories start to roll. There’s the one about bottled water from the Sea of Galilee, preciously savored for the children’s baptisms, that’s accidentally tossed out by a housekeeper at the governor's residence. Then there are Casey’s attestations of mom-hood, battling permanent marker scrawls on furniture and dragging by day’s end, when her husband comes home from work and she hands over the three children. The couple fires off all the indicators of wholesome family values to a conservative evangelical-heavy GOP audience. And even without mentioning Donald Trump's name, they set up an inescapable antithesis to the former president, who faces charges related to a porn star payoff and was found liable for sexual abuse and who, when he landed in Iowa on Thursday, wasn’t accompanied by his wife. The DeSantis team knows whom it’s playing to in Iowa and beyond. At a retreat for donors last week in Miami, campaign officials estimated that 65% of Iowa GOP caucusgoers are evangelical Christians. According to a person with knowledge of the DeSantis team’s early-state strategy, it's betting that that segment of the party is sick of the sexualized drama from a man also under investigation for classified documents seized from his sprawling Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. But breaking off conservative evangelical support from Trump is no easy feat, given that he is credited with having appointed three Supreme Court justices who eventually joined a conservative majority to overturn Roe v. Wade. Nevertheless, the DeSantis team sees it as a necessary path to winning early states. “Clearly, that is an opening for us with evangelicals,” the source familiar with early strategy said. “It’s authentic. You can’t fake your family. You can’t fake your commitment to your children and your wife. Once they see it’s authentic, that’s definitely a contrast. Who as a Republican thought we’d be defending payoffs to porn stars?” At the Miami retreat, a donor pointedly asked DeSantis’ chief pollster, Ryan Tyson, about Trump’s sex scandals and how the campaign planned to contrast them appropriately with DeSantis’ “beautiful” family. “I’ll answer it this way: A wise man told me once when I was about to have my first kid, he said 70% of being a good dad is showing up,” Tyson said, according to an audio of the retreat posted by Florida Politics. “The governor's going to show up. … Iowans are ripe to see that, and I think you’re going to see something pretty special happening as he shows up, as they meet the first lady, as they meet the family.” This week, in his first travel since he launched his campaign, DeSantis and his wife are barnstorming the three early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Casey DeSantis' role veers between moderator of staged fireside chats (husband and wife sat in cozy armchairs on the floor of a welding factory here near Sioux City on Wednesday morning) and featured speaker. An audience in Cedar Rapids later Wednesday gave her two standing ovations. The couple also announced Wednesday that they plan to take two of their three children with them on the campaign trail. “The 6 and the 5” — DeSantis shorthand for his oldest kids’ ages — will get their first taste of the presidential campaign life this weekend at Sen. Joni Ernst’s “Roast and Ride” in Des Moines, Iowa. Beyond that, images of their children are sprinkled into social media posts, featuring a family meal the last week of school or a video in which the two are holding children at different times while talking to the crowd. “You’ll see some very interesting moments with us,” Casey DeSantis told an audience of about 150 at the welding shop in Salix. “But we’re going to bring them, because, honestly, it’s so tough. You can’t get these years back, right? I mean, these are those fundamental years where the memories that you’ll have will last a lifetime.” DeSantis often tells GOP crowds that he has “no time for drama” or for “palace intrigue” — subtle allusions to Trump’s administration, which featured his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner in high-profile advisory roles. Ivanka Trump has said she wouldn’t be part of her father’s 2024 campaign. But it may be his wife's absence that's most conspicuous. Melania Trump didn’t accompany her husband to his Manhattan arraignment on charges related to the porn star payoff, nor did she attend a follow-up speech at Mar-a-Lago even as he boasted of having built his business with his family. In May, Melania Trump told Fox News that she fully supported her husband’s 2024 campaign and that it would be a “privilege” to serve as first lady again. Aside from trying to exude family values and relatability as parents, DeSantis' emphasis on his young family could help send subtle signals to Republicans that, at 44, he could represent the next generation of the party, over Trump, who is 76, or President Joe Biden, who is 80. “Their family is a great picture of what Americans are, and that’s about working hard to support your family,” Dan Zumbach — an Iowa state senator who has endorsed DeSantis and who introduced him Wednesday night to a crowd of about 500 in Cedar Rapids — said of DeSantis' family in an interview. “And I think they’re doing a great job of presenting the American story. We want a future for these kids and our grandkids, and they know how to get it done.” But when he was asked whether he saw DeSantis’ emphasis on his young family as a pointed contrast to Trump, Zumbach demurred. “Trump has a family, too,” he said. “And he’s just a little older, but no, I don’t see much of a difference.” A Trump campaign spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment. At nearly every event in Iowa this week, Casey DeSantis began her remarks by apologizing for her hoarse voice, which she blamed on the amount of time she had spent telling their 3-year-old daughter she couldn’t color the dining room table and the bathroom walls with permanent marker. (In Salix and again in Cedar Rapids, she made sure to note that mom and dad had FaceTimed the kids beforehand.) “It’s like a hamster on the wheel when you’re trying to talk to a 3-year-old,” she said. At the welding shop, the governor recalled the family’s return from his recent overseas trade mission at 3 a.m. “Our 6-year-old and the first lady had dance practice at 8 a.m., and Mason, our 5-year-old, and Mamie, our 3, had T-ball at 9 a.m. So we’re out doing our thing as parents … and I’ll tell you, I usually have a lot of endurance, but I was really dragging,” he said. “So they’re doing all their things,” he added, “then they had a birthday party, then Madison had a dance recital —” “At the beach, by the way,” the first lady interjected. “So, sandy bathing suit, back into the leotard.” How the strategy plays with Iowa caucusgoers and other voters remains to be seen. None of the dozen voters interviewed at DeSantis’ events Wednesday cited his family as a main reason they were interested in him. Some said they liked the emphasis they put on their young family and family values, but they were careful not to interpret it as a contrast with Trump. “Well, you can tell Trump loved his family. He counted on them a lot,” Morris Denson of Marengo said as he waited for DeSantis to speak in Cedar Rapids. “Family meant a lot to Trump and means a lot to DeSantis. Everybody has a different way to present it.” After having seen the DeSantises in Salix, Brenda Croker said effort to promote the family narrative is an “iffy” strategy. She was more impressed with how Casey DeSantis described her work connecting single mothers with faith-based organizations. “I believe in helping people but also in giving them the gospel — helping them get out of their situation without the government,” Croker said. But conservative Iowa-based radio show host Steve Deace saw the character differences as a compelling case for DeSantis, particularly with evangelicals. “If you’re worried about your kids and grandkids coming to you and saying, ‘How come it’s OK when Trump behaved like this as president and you look the other way, but you never looked the other way when I was behaving like this?’” Deace said. “Those are a lot of uncomfortable conversations that have been had in evangelical households the last few years. And if you have someone that can give you a lot of that same disruption but with some modicum of self-control, that’s not that hard of a sell.” "
U.S. to open northernmost diplomatic post in Norway; only mission above Arctic Circle,Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 8:33 AM UTC",World,"The United States will soon open a small diplomatic mission in Norway that will be its northernmost in the world and only such facility above the Arctic Circle, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Thursday. The move, which Blinken announced at a news conference in Oslo after attending a NATO foreign ministers meeting, comes as competition over the high north’s resources with Russia intensifies. Blinken said the U.S. would open what is known as an “American Presence Post” in Tromsoe, which sits 217 miles north of the Arctic Circle. The post will open later this year and be staffed by a single U.S. diplomat with the title of “consul.” “We’re here to work with like-minded allies to advance our vision of a peaceful, stable and cooperative Arctic,” Blinken said before meeting Norway’s foreign minister whose country is preparing to assume the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, which is headquartered in Tromsoe. Norway will take over the eight-nation grouping of countries that border the Arctic after two years of Russian leadership during which the bloc was largely ignored by other members due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The State Department had maintained an office in Tromsoe until 1994 but it was shuttered in a re-alignment of diplomatic facilities after the end of the Cold War. “The United States is a proud Arctic state and takes seriously our role as one of the region’s stewards,” U.S. Ambassador to Norway Marc Nathanson said in a statement. Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said Norway and the U.S. share a “long and proud history” of collaboration on Arctic issues. “I welcome U.S. plans to establish a Presence Post in Tromsoe this year, which I am sure will further strengthen our close cooperation,” she said.

"Senate passes debt ceiling bill, sending it to Biden to become law and avert disaster",Sahil Kapur,"June 2, 2023, 2:53 AM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 3:21 AM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Thursday night to pass a bill that would extend the debt ceiling for two years and establish a two-year budget agreement on a broad bipartisan vote. The vote was 63-36. Having already cleared the House on Wednesday, it now goes to President Joe Biden, who is expected to sign it and avert an economically catastrophic debt default with mere days to spare before Monday's deadline. The agreement was brokered by Biden, a Democrat, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, after a lengthy stalemate and a frenzied few weeks of negotiations as the U.S. neared the cliff. Biden will address the nation on the bill at 7 p.m. ET Friday. ""America can breathe a sigh of relief. Because in this process we are avoiding default,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""The consequences of default would be catastrophic."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., championed the bill as ""an urgent and important step in the right direction — for the health of our economy and the future of our country."" The final Senate vote came after 11 amendments were considered — a demand by various senators in exchange for agreeing to vote on the bill quickly; all of the amendments were shot down. That agreement allowed the Senate to skip a series of hurdles that could have, without unanimous consent, pushed the U.S. past the debt ceiling deadline Monday. Senators also wanted to leave town for a long weekend, hastening the procedural talks. Extending the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending; it enables the U.S. to pay existing debts that both parties have accumulated over many years through demands for higher spending on domestic and military programs, as well as lower taxes. Once it is signed into law, the bill will cap spending for the next two years with a modest cut to nonmilitary spending and a modest expansion in defense spending. It includes conservative measures to claw back about $28 billion in unspent Covid relief funds, eliminate $1.4 billion in IRS funding and overhaul the permitting process for energy projects. The bill will restart federal student loan payments after a lengthy ""pause"" that began early in the pandemic. And it would impose work requirements for people up to 55 years old to get benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF; currently, work requirements are in place for recipients up to 50 years old. The SNAP and TANF changes include carve-outs for veterans, homeless people and adults up to 24 aging out of foster care. The Biden-McCarthy agreement would not make any changes to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Schumer celebrated the bill as a Democratic win Thursday night, noting that more Democrats backed the bill than Republicans in both chambers. ""I thank my colleagues for the good work tonight,"" Schumer said. ""I commend President Biden and his team for producing a sensible compromise under the most difficult of circumstances. So many of the destructive provisions in the Republican bill are gone."" McConnell praised McCarthy in a statement for acting first and passing a bill that ""avoids the catastrophic consequences of default and begins to curb Washington Democrats’ addiction to reckless spending that grows our nation’s debt.""

Man who attacked U.S. Rep. Angie Craig in elevator pleads guilty,Phil Helsel,"June 2, 2023, 12:22 AM UTC",U.S. news,"A man who attacked Rep. Angie Craig in a Washington, D.C., elevator in February pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday, officials said. Kendrid Hamlin, 26, pleaded guilty to one count of assault on a member of Congress for the attack in the elevator of her apartment building, as well as two counts of assault on a law enforcement officer, prosecutors said. Craig, D-Minn., had bruising but escaped the Feb. 9 attack, her representative said at the time. Craig had said hello to Hamlin, who was in the lobby of an apartment building that morning, but when she went in an elevator he followed her, according to court documents. Hamlin allegedly said he wanted to go to Craig's’s apartment and use the restroom, and Craig refused, Capitol Police said in an affidavit. Hamlin then “became agitated,” and when Craig tried to move past him he punched her in the face and grabbed her around her collarbone area, keeping her from the elevator buttons, the affidavit said. Craig threw her hot coffee on him and escaped. Hamlin was arrested that evening by police who recognized him from a description, according to court documents. Hamlin's federal public defender, Katie D’Adamo Guevara, said Thursday that Hamlin accepted responsibility for his actions and wants and needs mental health treatment and rehabilitation. ""Unfortunately, we know that meaningful treatment and rehabilitation will not occur in prison,"" she said. Hamlin's public defenders have written in court documents that he was experiencing homelessness and untreated mental illness and that he was in the lobby of the apartment building that day because of the cold. Craig told NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis at the time of the attack that she was violently assaulted. “I don’t know if I had time to be scared. When he demanded to go to my apartment, all I knew at that moment was there’s no way in hell that’s going to happen,” she said. Hamlin did not know Craig was a member of Congress, his attorney said, and Capitol Police have said there was no evidence she was targeted because of her position. Assaulting a member of Congress carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, and assault on a law enforcement officer is a misdemeanor carrying up to six months, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said in a statement. CORRECTION (Friday, June 2, 8:11 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article contained some references that used the wrong last name of the representative who was attacked. She is Angie Craig, not Lee. "
The Senate will vote on the debt ceiling deal Thursday night,Frank Thorp V,"June 1, 2023, 4:49 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 11:57 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — The Senate will vote on the debt ceiling deal negotiated by President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Thursday night, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced. Senators have come to an agreement to pass the bill after having voted on a series of 11 amendments from members of both parties who oppose the deal or certain parts of it. The agreement is expected to pass when the series has ended. It needs 60 votes to pass and would then head to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature. Biden must sign the bill into law by Monday to avoid a default, according to the Treasury Department. Senate leaders worked throughout the day to get an agreement on amendment votes, which will allow senators to get their colleagues on the record on a variety of issues related to the bill. The series of amendment votes, which began at 7:30 p.m. ET, could take hours. All 100 senators had to agree to speed consideration of the measure, and the amendment votes were meant to get the whole chamber on board. If any senator objects, the final vote could have been pushed to as late as Wednesday, two days past the deadline. In addition to seeking amendment votes, Republicans had asked Schumer to commit to bring up all 12 government spending bills this year to avoid an across-the-board spending cut in the debt ceiling bill. They also wanted a commitment to bring up supplemental funding legislation to increase defense spending and assist Ukraine in its fight against Russia. The Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass an increase in defense spending on its own. The deal to pass the debt ceiling bill came after negotiations between both parties. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., was seen shuttling between a Republican lunch and the Senate floor, where Democrats were huddling earlier in the day. She at one point pulled Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., into a room just off the Senate floor to look over a piece of paper she had. By the end of the GOP lunch, Republican senators said they expected Schumer to make those assurances and announce a deal. Schumer opened the Senate floor Thursday morning urging quick passage of the bill. “Time is a luxury the Senate does not have if we want to prevent default. June 5th is less than four days away,” he said, adding that the Senate will stay in session until the bill has passed. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who called the bill a ""deal from hell,"" said that he would file multiple amendments but that he wouldn't hold up the deal ""for the sake of holding it up."" The Senate will vote on one amendment he offered. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., also succeeded in getting a vote on an amendment to remove a provision that would expedite the approval of a natural gas pipeline backed by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Kaine got into what he called a ""robust debate"" with Manchin over the provision at a Senate lunch Wednesday and expressed outrage that the White House didn't give him a head's up that it would be in the deal. “It’s slimy,” Kaine said. “It didn’t have to go on the debt ceiling bill. I mean, for God’s sake, does this company really feel like they’re as important as the creditworthiness of the United States?” The amendments aren't expected to pass, as that would send the whole bill back to the House with little time left to avoid a default. “At this point, any needless delay or any last-minute holdups would be an unnecessary and even dangerous risk,"" Schumer warned Thursday. ""And any change to this bill that forces us to send it back to the House would be entirely unacceptable. It would almost guarantee default.” "
DACA program is debated in court before judge who ruled it unlawful,Nicole Acevedo,"June 1, 2023, 11:10 PM UTC",Immigration,"Attorneys representing young immigrants protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA, defended the legality of the program before a court in Texas on Thursday in an attempt to keep it alive. The federal judge presiding over the hearing was the same one who declared DACA illegal in 2021, closing the program for new applicants. At the time, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen said the Obama administration failed to follow federal administrative rules in launching the program in 2012. DACA, which was implemented in 2012 as an executive order by  then-President Barack Obama, has allowed eligible undocumented young adults who came to the U.S. as children to work and study without fear of deportation. Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and an attorney representing DACA recipients in a legal challenge brought against the program by Texas and other Republican-led states, said the case went back to Hanen's court to consider a recent Biden administration rule that turned the program into a federal regulation to increase its chances of surviving legal challenges. The nine states that have sued to end DACA ""lack standing to sue,"" Perales said in a news conference outside the court after the hearing ended Thursday afternoon, adding that the states have not been able to prove that DACA has caused them any harm or injury. ""We should not be in court, at all, having to defend DACA,"" Perales said. The states that sued are Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, West Virginia, Kansas and Mississippi. In court filings, the states argued that the updated program is essentially the same as the 2012 memo that first created it and remains “unlawful and unconstitutional.” The states also argued that the White House overstepped its authority by granting immigration benefits that are for Congress to decide. Perales and her team argued DACA is legal because it's the byproduct of ""a lawful exercise of executive discretion over immigration,"" she said. DACA is also consistent with other policies the U.S. government has implemented in the past that provide deportation relief in exchange of permission to work, Perales said in a phone call with reporters Tuesday. More than 580,000 DACA recipients live in the U.S. An overwhelming majority were born in Mexico and other Latin American countries. The average DACA recipient is ages 26 to 28, according to Gaby Pacheco of The Dream.US, an organization helping DACA recipients and other immigrant youths known as Dreamers go to college. ""They have more to lose now because many of them are already 10 years in the workforce; they have careers, they have families,"" Pacheco told reporters Tuesday. Maritza Gutierrez, a DACA recipient who was among more than 50 people gathered at a park near the courthouse, urged Congress to pass a ""permanent solution, not something that needs to be renewed every two years."" ""Stop using our lives and that of our children as political pawns,"" Gutierrez, who's a mother to a 2-year-old child, said in Spanish outside the court. Hanen is not expected to immediately rule after Thursday’s court hearing. But whatever decision he makes could eventually end up before the U.S. Supreme Court for a third time. "
"Ron DeSantis fires back at NAACP over travel advisory, education and shootings",Jonathan Allen,"June 1, 2023, 10:29 PM UTC",2024 Election,"ROCHESTER, N.H. — Black students in Baltimore and Chicago ""have a better chance of getting shot than getting a first-class education,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday as he campaigned for the presidency here. DeSantis, who stands second to former President Donald Trump in the GOP primary field, has staked his political persona on fighting what he describes as the ""woke"" ideology of voters who support diversity initiatives in schools, government and the corporate world. The comparison of gun violence and education is one DeSantis raised, with little fanfare, in his campaign launch on Twitter Spaces last week. But Thursday's remarks appear to be the first time he has made the assertion since he began visiting early primary states as a candidate. He did so in criticizing the NAACP. Last month, the NAACP issued a national ""travel advisory"" warning Americans about visiting Florida in response to what it described as DeSantis' push to ""erase Black history and to restrict diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in Florida schools."" DeSantis defended himself Thursday, saying that Florida's crime rate is at ""a 50-year low"" and that Black students perform well in the state because of government support for private school vouchers. Ultimately, his framing amounts to a shorthand for the view that subsidies for ""school choice"" will improve educational outcomes for students of color and lead to lower gun violence. ""If you’re in Baltimore or Chicago, these kids have a better chance of getting shot than getting a first-class education,"" he said. DeSantis, a Yale and Harvard law graduate who routinely denounces the Ivy League as an ivory tower of liberalism, didn’t say how he defines a first-class education. But his campaign cited a series of data points in support of his assertion in response to an inquiry from NBC News. For Baltimore, the sole statistic was a federal Education Department report showing that only 4% of Black fourth graders were rated ""proficient"" in math in the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress. Another 30% were rated as having a ""basic"" achievement level. For Chicago, the DeSantis camp cited a study showing that 7.5% of Black Chicagoans have been shot by age 40 and a report from a nonprofit pro-vouchers group that found that just 6% of Black Chicago students are proficient in math. The mixed statistics don't add up — or amount to a solution for gun violence — said Hilary Shelton, the NAACP's national adviser for governance and policy. ""His comparison seems so convoluted,"" Shelton said in a television interview with NBC News. ""We should talk about the real data and statistics. We know that, disproportionately in the state of Florida, African American children are more likely to get shot and killed. We know that in the state of Florida, African American children are more likely to be impacted by law enforcement and mistakes being made."" The population of New Hampshire, which will hold the first presidential primary — shortly after Republicans compete in the Iowa caucus next year — is about 93% white and about 2% African American, according to the latest census data. Shelton said DeSantis is ""obscuring the issue"" by meshing education and gun violence in cities he doesn't govern and ""not addressing"" the problem. ""He wants to talk about Baltimore, and he wants to talk about Chicago,"" Shelton said. ""There are issues that need to be addressed in those places, but he is by no means an expert on those places."" DeSantis is one of the nation's leading voices in favor of taxpayer subsidies for private schools, having signed a law that makes ""school choice"" universal in Florida. Critics said his move to expand eligibility to all students — the vouchers were previously available to low-income students and those with disabilities — would harm public schools, reduce accountability for performance and possibly lead to resegregation in Florida.

Republican Arizona official who faced harassment over elections won’t seek re-election,Zoë Richards,"June 1, 2023, 10:19 PM UTC",2024 Election,"Republican Bill Gates, a county official in Arizona whose role overseeing elections last year brought him a torrent of threats that required him to temporarily be moved to an undisclosed location, announced Thursday that he will not seek re-election next year. Gates announced his decision not to seek a third term on Maricopa County's Board of Supervisors in a statement Thursday that described his efforts to resist “external pressure” and to tell ""the truth about our elections in the face of false information"" in a county that has been at the center of election denialism in Arizona. Arizona has been the scene of aggressive efforts by Republican candidates to contest their defeats with false accusations of voter fraud. In 2020, former President Donald Trump argued that he had not lost the state's presidential contest. And Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake was defeated last year, a loss she continues to try to litigate through the courts. Gates is one of five members of the county’s governing board, which Lake, who had Trump's endorsement, targeted as she sought to sow doubt over election results after she lost the governor’s race to Democrat Katie Hobbs last year. In at least one lawsuit contesting the election, Lake named Gates specifically. “As this chapter comes to an end, I rest well knowing that I left with integrity, compassion, and dignity. Regardless of personal partisan preferences or external pressure, I remained focused on making our region the best place to live, work, and raise a family,"" Gates said. ""At Maricopa County, I kept government lean, taxes low, supported our most vulnerable residents, and told the truth about our elections in the face of false information. My will to fight for the truth remains unhindered, and I look forward to Maricopa County running the 2024 election."" Gates' plans were first reported by The Washington Post. While Gates said he is looking forward to his ""next chapter,"" he did not elaborate in the statement about his plans. In an interview before the midterm elections last year, Gates said he had been working with local law enforcement agencies as Maricopa County faced a barrage of “vile emails and social media posts.” Then, just weeks after the election, local law enforcement officials urged Gates and his family to relocate temporarily as they investigated mounting threats. Gates did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether past incidents with harassment played a role in his decision. Gates is among a wave of elections workers who described intensifying harassment and safety concerns after the 2020 election and Trump’s efforts to overturn it, some of whom opted to resign. A number of election officials in battleground states like Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania have resigned, retired or decided against seeking re-election since the 2020 election. Gates, who served on the Phoenix City Council from June 2009 through May 2016, was first elected to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in 2016. He served one year as Phoenix's vice mayor in 2013. "
Trump and DeSantis spar over how long they could serve as president,Allan Smith,"June 1, 2023, 10:12 PM UTC",2024 Election,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has zeroed in on a potential vulnerability for Donald Trump in his quest to defeat him for the GOP presidential nomination — the fact that the former president can serve just one term if he is elected. At campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire this week, DeSantis repeatedly highlighted that he, unlike Trump, could serve two consecutive terms and therefore would be better positioned to enact longer-lasting change. Trump, meanwhile, has hit back by suggesting he could accomplish a similar set of goals much more quickly. He has countered that if DeSantis is talking about needing eight full years, ""you don't want him as your president."" Trump's GOP detractors have seen the emerging battlefield as an opening to take him on for months now, as NBC News reported this year. Trump is limited to only one additional term if he wins, because the Constitution prohibits a person from being elected president more than twice. Speaking Thursday in New Hampshire about needing to upend the federal bureaucracy, DeSantis said, ""You really need to ensure that we have a two-term president to be able to see this to a conclusion. ""I mean, you do one term, and they reverse it when they come in,"" he added. ""You can’t have it be reversed. We can’t let the bureaucracy just wait us out."" The comments echoed his remarks Wednesday in Iowa in his pitch about dramatically changing the federal workforce. ""There have been many people that have talked about doing something about it,"" he said of the ""administrative state."" ""No one’s really been able to make much of a difference. And I think part of the reason is you really need a very disciplined, energetic president willing to spit nails and fight the needed battles every single day for eight years. ""Just to be clear, this is not something you can just flip a switch on,"" he added. ""If it was, it would be so easy, right? Some people could tell you, 'I’ll fix it all in the first day.' That’s not the way it works. This is really, really significant, day after day. And it really requires two terms to be able to finish the job. I think we could bring George Washington back, and I don’t think he could do it in just one four-year term."" Trump has taken notice of DeSantis' swipes. Speaking Thursday in Iowa, he promised he could get done ""within six months"" what would take DeSantis two terms. ""When he says eight years, every time I hear it I winced,"" Trump said, ""because they say if it takes eight years to turn this around — you don’t want him as your president."" And in a radio interview with the Iowa-based conservative radio host Simon Conway, Trump emphasized: ""I don't need eight years."" ""I can turn this around so fast, getting inflation down, getting interest rates down, getting the economy back. This is going to take six months,"" he said. ""When I hear him saying he needs eight years — if he needs eight years to turn it around, you don’t want him as your president. I can tell you that."" While few Republicans think Trump's term-limited candidacy will be the primary case rivals can use to bolster their bids, some think it will be helpful. Ahead of his launch last month, DeSantis’ team signaled it would highlight Trump’s inability to serve two terms as part of its messaging. “It may give folks who are inclined to sort of move away from Trump anyway cover with their pro-Trump friends — you know, ‘I’d vote for Trump in a second if I thought he could serve eight years, but four is just not enough,’” Mick Mulvaney, who was Trump’s acting White House chief of staff, said this year. Trump allies, meanwhile, have echoed his recent comments about the matter by saying he could do more in four years than someone else could do in eight. “I think people are into one-terming. I think we’re just an impatient country,” an adviser close to Trump said this year. “I think that Trump won’t say ‘only one term.’ I think what he’ll say is ‘I want to complete the unfinished business.’” DeSantis clearly doesn't see it that way. Pressed Thursday by NBC News' Gabe Gutierrez about Trump's claims he can — within six months — deliver on similar promises DeSantis says will take longer to fully achieve, DeSantis fired back: ""Then why didn't he do it his first four years?""

Four GOP governors send National Guard to the southern border,Summer Concepcion,"May 31, 2023, 4:27 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 9:52 PM UTC",Immigration,"Three Republican governors ordered National Guard troops to the southern border this week to help interdict drug and human trafficking at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s request. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster announced their decisions to send troops to the Texas-Mexico border on Wednesday, while South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem announced her move on Thursday. They join Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in doing so, who issued his own order last month. In his statement Wednesday, Youngkin announced that he had signed an executive directive to send 100 National Guard troops to support Abbott’s Operation Lone Star. In March, Abbott asked other Republican governors to send troops to the southern border through an Emergency Management Assistance Compact, which allows states to send resources in times of disaster or crisis. Youngkin cited the increase in the flow of illegal drugs and human trafficking on the border, which he said is “devastating Virginia families and communities.” “The ongoing border crisis facing our nation has turned every state into a border state,” Youngkin said. “As leadership solutions at the federal level fall short, states are answering the call to secure our southern border, reduce the flow of fentanyl, combat human trafficking and address the humanitarian crisis.” Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, slammed Youngkin's decision. ""In his obsessive quest to tee himself up for a presidential campaign, Youngkin is continuing to ignore the basic needs of Virginians to bolster his standing with the MAGA base,” Swecker wrote in a statement. McMaster said the move is necessary for the ""safety and security of South Carolinians."" “At the request of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, I have directed the deployment of South Carolina National Guard troops to Texas to help hold the line on the Southern border,"" McMaster said in a statement. “The safety and security of South Carolinians require that we stop the drug cartels, criminals, and terrorists from entering our country to peddle their poison.” Details about how many troops South Carolina will deploy will be finalized in the coming weeks, with the goal of deployment by July 1, McMaster's office said. By Thursday afternoon, Noem had joined in, announcing she was deploying ""at least 50"" South Dakota National Guard troops to the southern border later this summer. “The border crisis is growing worse under President Biden’s willful inaction. Across the country, crime rates, drug overdoses, and human trafficking have all skyrocketed because our border remains a warzone,” she said in a statement. Youngkin and McMaster said Abbott briefed them last week. “Given the intensive resource demands on Texas, the dangers posed by the fentanyl crisis, and impact of the border crisis on criminal activity to the Commonwealth, Virginia will do its part to assist the State of Texas’ efforts with the coordinated deployment of Virginia National Guard soldiers to assist in key aspects of their mission,” Youngkin said. Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DeSantis announced in mid-May that he is sending more than 1,100 state law enforcement agents and National Guard members to Texas’ border with Mexico. The number is a tenfold increase compared to a similar move in 2021. DeSantis’ office said at the time that personnel would be at the border for 30 days, with possible extensions. Abbott and DeSantis have blamed President Joe Biden for the influx of migrants at the southern border. DeSantis signed a sweeping immigration overhaul bill a day before the Biden administration ended Title 42, a Covid restriction that expedited the expulsion of migrants. Meanwhile, Abbott has bused migrants to Democratic cities, and he told Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a letter last month that the move is necessary “until Biden secures the border to stop the inflow of mass migration.” "
"Work stoppages, rallies support ‘A Day Without Immigrants’ in protest of DeSantis law",Edwin Flores,"June 1, 2023, 9:40 PM UTC",Immigration,"HOMESTEAD, Fla. — Farmworkers didn't show up to work, plant nursery owners closed for the day and many businesses didn't open to the public in a show of solidarity. A national boycott dubbed “Un Día Sin Inmigrantes,” or “A day without immigrants,” took place Thursday as a protest against a Florida immigration law scheduled to take effect in July. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who recently announced he's running as a Republican presidential candidate, last month signed into law SB-1718, which includes penalties for certain employers if they don't verify a worker's immigration status and for those who transport people who are undocumented, among other provisions. It also requires Florida hospitals that accept Medicaid include a citizenship question on forms, thus discouraging many immigrants from getting medical care. “Who’s to blame? Only the governor, because he stirred a hornet’s nest he shouldn’t have gotten involved with,” said William De La Cruz, whose Eagle Nursery in Homestead closed its doors Thursday. “[DeSantis] also eats from the produce that immigrants pick,” the owner told Noticias Telemundo in an interview. Protests were scheduled in Florida and at least eight other states, including California, Georgia, Minnesota, Illinois, Oregon, Texas, South Carolina and Colorado. In downtown Los Angeles, near the historic Placita Olvera, a group of protesters gathered to denounce SB-1718 and “demand dignity, respect, and a path to citizenship for ALL!,” the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, or CHIRLA, tweeted. “We are not one, we are not 100, we are millions, count us right,” a video depicting a crowd chanting in unison and in Spanish showed. In Florida, some immigrant families, mostly Latinos, have left the state and others are debating whether or not to do the same before the law takes effect. “We’re feeling the impact because there are families who have been moving to different states, fleeing from this nefarious and arbitrary law that really destroys a lot of families,” Jesús Rojas, who closed his two Peruvian restaurants in Orlando on Thursday, told Noticias Telemundo. A nursery worker of Mexican heritage who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions told WTVJ, an NBC affiliate in Miami, “We basically have to flee, flee like if we were criminals and we’re not — on the contrary, we’re here to work.” Following the passage of SB-1718, unconfirmed viral videos surfaced online depicting empty construction sites, businesses and agricultural fields. Latino truckers nationwide took to TikTok advocating other truckers boycott Florida. The Florida Trucking Association told NBC News in a statement Thursday that they knew about the videos that had gone viral but were not aware of any issues impacting the state, according to CEO and President Alix Miller. “A day without immigrants” came almost a week after a protest organized by WeCount!, a local organization advocating for immigrant workers, in the agricultural town of Homestead. The event saw a turnout of more than 2,000 people outside Homestead City Hall expressing their opposition to the new law. "
Biden 'fine' after fall onstage at Air Force Academy graduation,Rebecca Shabad,"June 1, 2023, 7:34 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 7:56 PM UTC",White House,"President Joe Biden fell onstage Thursday at the Air Force Academy's graduation ceremony and is ""fine,"" a White House aide said. After Biden shook the hands of more than 900 graduates, he turned to head back to his seat and started to motion as if he were going to jog. He then appeared to trip and fell down on the stage. Biden, 80, was helped up by two Secret Service agents and an Air Force official, and he then turned and pointed to something onstage that he might have tripped over. Ben LaBolt, the White House communications director, retweeted a reporter who posted about the incident and said Biden was OK. After Biden returned to his seat, he continued to talk with graduates, taking photos and selfies. As he was leaving the event, he started to jog several times. He later boarded Air Force One to fly back to Washington. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters ""he's totally fine"" and noted that Biden boarded the plane smiling. Last year, Biden fell off his bike on a weekend trip to his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Biden's re-election bid has faced questions about whether he is fit to seek another four-year term. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 33% of adults in the U.S. think Biden is in good enough physical shape to serve effectively as president, while 64% said that about former President Donald Trump, who is 76 and also running for a second term in the White House. Biden's physician said in February that he remains ""fit"" to conduct his duties as president. “President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” the White House physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in a five-page memo. O’Connor said his assessment was based on a “comprehensive review” of Biden’s medical history and a detailed physical examination that included specialty consultations at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

"In blow to unions, Supreme Court rules company can pursue strike damage claim",Lawrence Hurley,"June 1, 2023, 2:12 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 7:05 PM UTC",Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — In a loss for organized labor, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled in favor of a concrete company in Washington state seeking to revive a lawsuit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters alleging that a strike damaged its product. The 8-1 decision, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, means the company, Glacier Northwest Inc., can pursue a lawsuit against the union in state court over an August 2017 strike in which drivers walked off the job, leaving wet concrete in their trucks. The company claims the union is liable for what it says was intentional damage to its product. Barrett, one of the court's six conservatives, wrote that a state court was wrong to dismiss the claims at such an early stage in proceedings based on its concern that the claims conflicted with the National Labor Relations Act, a federal law that protects union activity. ""Because the union took affirmative steps to endanger Glacier's property rather than reasonable precautions to mitigate that risk, the NLRA does not arguably protect its conduct,"" Barrett wrote. Organized labor advocates had raised concern that a ruling in favor of the company could stifle strike actions by opening up unions to damages claims for a wide variety of potential losses employers can face as a result of such activities. Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, saying the ruling ""risks erosion of the right to strike."" Jackson's two liberal colleagues, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, joined the court's conservative justices in the majority. Jackson pointed out that the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint after the state court ruling, charging the company with unfair labor practices and saying the drivers’ actions were “arguably protected.” By ruling in favor of the company, the court ""inserts itself into this conflict, proceeding to opine on the propriety of the union's strike activity,"" despite not being the best place to weigh the facts, she wrote. ""This case is Exhibit A as to why the board — and not the courts — should ordinarily take the first crack at resolving contentious, fact-bound labor disputes of this nature,"" she added. The dispute centers on an incident in which members of Teamsters Local 174 went on strike after negotiations broke down over a new collective bargaining agreement. When truck drivers walked off the job, the company says, some of the concrete already being delivered was rendered useless. Drivers returned trucks to the company’s facility, some of which had partial or full loads on board. As a result of the strike, concrete was left in the trucks and had to be removed to harden and then be broken up before it could be disposed of, the company says. The union says that when the workers returned the trucks, the cement was wet, and that they left the drums on the trucks rotating, meaning it would not immediately congeal. It was the company’s decision to remove the concrete and then break it up once it hardened, the union says. Glacier says it lost $100,000 as a result of failing to fulfill a contract on the day of the strike, and it also claims additional damages. The company says it was able to do the previously scheduled work the following week. The Washington Supreme Court ruled for the union in December 2021, saying any loss of concrete was “incidental to a strike arguably protected by federal law.” Noel Francisco, the company’s lawyer, said Thursday's ruling “vindicates the long-standing principle that federal law does not shield labor unions from tort liability when they intentionally destroy an employer’s property.” Sean O'Brien, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, criticized the decision, referring to the justices as ""political hacks"" and saying the court had ""again voted in favor of corporations over working people"" by throwing out longstanding precedent. “Make no mistake — this ruling has everything to do with giving companies more power to hobble workers if any attempt is made to fight back against a growing system of corruption,” he said. Notwithstanding the harsh rhetoric, Charlotte Garden, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who specializes in labor law, said the ruling “isn’t as bad as it could have been” for organized labor because it does not directly threaten the right to strike. But, she added, it leaves open the possibility that “unions can be on the hook for product loss that is attributable to things that the employer did after the union knew it was going to strike.” For example, a union could be liable for a restaurant’s losing perishable food as a result of a strike if the employer did not know about the impending action at the time of the purchase but the workers did, Garden said. Business interests that are often in conflict with organized labor have heavily criticized the labor board in the past. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has ruled against unions several times in recent years, including in a 2018 case in which the court said public-sector workers who choose not to join unions cannot be compelled to pay a share of union dues for covering the cost of negotiating contracts. The number of strikes has increased amid a renewed interest in some sectors in the protections that union jobs can offer. The company was backed by business and anti-union groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which said in a brief that the state court’s finding that intentional destruction of property could be deemed a protected activity conflicted with U.S. Supreme Court precedent. Various labor groups and unions backed the Teamsters. "
"Justice Dept. defends Trump family separations in court, citing 'perceived humanitarian considerations'",Nicole Acevedo,"June 1, 2023, 6:45 PM UTC",Immigration,"Attorneys from President Joe Biden's Justice Department are still defending actions from the Trump administration that led to the forced separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border — including the argument that the families were separated out of ""perceived humanitarian considerations,"" a recent court filing shows. The argument shows a stark contrast with Biden's past criticisms of the separations as “criminal.” In fighting five asylum-seeking mothers who are suing the federal government for the trauma they say they and their children suffered because of the separation policy, the Justice Department has also questioned the families' ability to seek monetary damages through the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows people to sue for injuries resulting from federal officers’ unlawful conduct. Attorneys from the Justice Department argued in a court document filed May 24 that the mothers' claims were ""not cognizable"" under the Federal Tort Claims Act, also known as FTCA. They also justified immigration enforcement actions from some Trump administration officials, saying the U.S. government has ample discretion when it decides how to regulate immigration. The separations were part of Trump’s broader “zero-tolerance” policy, which focused on prosecuting anyone illegally crossing the southwest border, as well as a pilot program that preceded it, officials said at the time. It separated more than 5,600 children from their parents in 2017 and 2018. The agencies implementing the policy did not adequately plan how the children would be reunited with their parents, leaving hundreds of them still separated years later. The Justice Department said in its filing that when Trump administration Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claimed to have signed a memo in May 2018 directing immigration agents to refer migrant parents for prosecution, and thereby separating families, her intention was not ""to use separations of parents and children to inflict harm,” but instead it was “in furtherance of policy objectives relating to immigration enforcement.” That made the department immune to legal challenges under the law, according to the filing. The immigration enforcement objectives cited were “border security, allocation of personnel and resources, and perceived humanitarian considerations,” the Justice Department wrote. The argument seems to gloss over statements made by officials in the Trump administration who discussed using family separations to “deter” migrant families from seeking asylum in the U.S. The Justice Department also said the families that are suing are trying to circumvent the government's legal immunity by basing their claims ""upon their separations, not law enforcement actions."" The five asylum-seeking mothers and their children are among multiple migrant families who have filed nearly 30 lawsuits against the federal government seeking monetary damages through FTCA for how they were treated under the family separation policy. A task force of the Department of Homeland Security, which is in charge of immigration enforcement, is working to reunite the remaining children with their parents. It has reunited around 700 families in the U.S., but hundreds more remain separated. The Justice Department has used similar arguments in other FTCA lawsuits. It also highlighted Biden’s opposition to the policy in an initial court filing, but that hasn't stopped his administration from fighting the families in court, leaving advocates outraged. The lead lawyer in the case that ended the Trump administration’s policy, Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Immigrant Civil Rights Project, had harsh words after the recent Justice Department filing. “I think the Biden administration will come to regret not only defending these lawsuits but seeking to minimize the unthinkable damage done to these little children,"" Gelernt said. The nonprofit Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights tweeted Tuesday, ""It is appalling to see the Biden administration defend one of the most egregious human rights violations in recent memory.” Attorneys representing the migrant families in FTCA cases declined to comment. In late April, the Justice Department said it had reached a settlement with a separated parent in a different lawsuit; specifics have not been released. The arguments from Biden’s Justice Department seem to contradict statements from Biden and high-ranking officials at the departments of Justice and Homeland Security. As a candidate, Biden described the deliberate separations by the Trump administration as “criminal” and “abhorrent.” At his confirmation hearings, Attorney General Merrick Garland said that the policy was “shameful” and that he “couldn’t imagine anything worse.” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called the policy “cruel and inhumane.” The White House and the Department of Homeland Security declined to answer questions about last week's filing, referring NBC News to the Justice Department, which declined to comment on the recent filings, citing the pending litigation. Asked why the Justice Department is still fighting the families in court considering senior administration officials' statements, it declined to comment but referred NBC News to a 2021 statement from the agency that said, “While the parties have been unable to reach a global settlement agreement at this time, we remain committed to engaging with the plaintiffs and to bringing justice to the victims of this abhorrent policy.” Given the multitude of lawsuits separated families have filed against the federal government, court efforts to reach a global settlement to compensate families emerged in 2021. Each affected family initially stood to received hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. But later that year, the Biden administration walked away from the negotiations. They ended after Biden publicly criticized the size of the reported settlements in response to a question from a Fox News reporter. Lawyers from the Justice Department first pushed to lower the amount paid to the families before they walked away entirely, even though Biden ultimately voiced his support for a settlement. “You deserve some kind of compensation, no matter what the circumstance,” Biden said at a news conference then. “What that will be I have no idea.” CORRECTION (June 1, 2023, 8:30 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the first name of former President Donald Trump’s homeland security secretary. She is Kirstjen Nielsen, not Kristjen. It also misspelled the last name of President Joe Biden’s homeland security secretary. He is Alejandro Mayorkas, not Majorkas. And it misstated when the Justice Department filed a court document. It filed the document May 24, not Wednesday. "
Trump attorneys seek recusal of judge in New York criminal case,Adam Reiss,"June 1, 2023, 12:10 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 6:44 PM UTC",Trump investigations,"Attorneys for former President Donald Trump have filed a motion seeking to have the judge recuse himself from the Manhattan criminal case against him. Trump’s lawyers accused Judge Juan Merchan in a statement Wednesday evening of having conflicts, which the statement says are detailed in the motion. The motion seeks to have Merchan, who presided over Trump’s arraignment on 34 counts of falsifying business records in Manhattan, step aside, Trump's lawyers said. “President Trump, like all Americans, is entitled under the Constitution to an impartial judge and fair legal process,"" his lawyers said in the statement, adding that the motion alleges Merchan has ""significant conflicts."" The motion is not yet public, and the Manhattan district attorney’s office was making redactions, lawyers involved in the process said. A spokesperson said the district attorney's office would review the motion and respond in court papers. Trump has complained on social media that Merchan, a New York Supreme Court judge, “hates me.” Prominent lawyers NBC News interviewed about Merchan’s reputation say he is fair. (Supreme Court is the name for the state's highest trial court.) In Wednesday night's statement, Trump's lawyers in part raised the fact that Merchan presided over the criminal case against the Trump Organization. Their statement also refers to Merchan’s daughter's employment with a political firm that worked for President Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Merchan fined the Trump Organization $1.6 million for a long-running tax fraud scheme. The prosecution's star witness was the Trump Organization's former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, who testified against the company as part of a plea agreement. Weisselberg pleaded guilty to tax fraud charges in August and was sentenced to five months in prison. He was sent to Rikers Island in January and released in April. A Manhattan grand jury indicted Trump in March on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in paying hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about an alleged affair with him a decade earlier. He has pleaded not guilty and has repeatedly denied an affair. The district attorney's office, which brought the case before the grand jury, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night. The criminal trial has been set for March. "
Kamala Harris announces rule to tackle racial bias in home valuations,Katherine Doyle,"June 1, 2023, 6:33 PM UTC",White House,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is developing a rule to tackle racial bias in home valuations, Vice President Kamala Harris said Thursday. “Today, I’m proud to announce we are developing a rule that will require that financial institutions ensure that their appraisal algorithms are not biased, for example, that they do not produce lower valuations for homes owned by people of color,” Harris said on a call with reporters. “We are also releasing the guidance to make it easier for consumers to appeal what they suspect to be unbiased valuation.” The move is part of an effort to ensure fair algorithms and increased transparency for home valuations, according to the White House. Harris described homeownership as among the most powerful ways for American families to build wealth and said Black and Latino families’ homes are more likely to be undervalued than those of other homeowners, raising the cost of a mortgage. “Millions rely on the equity in their homes to put their children through college, to fund a startup, to retire with dignity, to create intergenerational prosperity and wealth,” Harris said. “We also know for generations many people of color have been prevented from taking full advantage of the benefits of homeownership.” Harris said only about 5% of home appraisers are people of color, a share the administration hopes to grow through training opportunities for groups underrepresented in the industry. She said the goal is “to make sure that people who conduct home appraisals better reflect the communities they serve.” Studies have found that white-owned homes are more likely than homes owned by Black people to be appraised at values that exceed algorithmic predictions, President Joe Biden’s domestic policy adviser, Neera Tanden, said on the call. The administration will also make home valuation data for more than 600,000 properties public, growing a pool of data that includes 48 million homes, Harris said. The announcement marks two years since Biden, on the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, launched a sweeping effort to identify and eliminate bias in home appraisals and valuations, known as the Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity Task Force. An action plan Harris released last year sought to uncover and end racial or ethnic bias in the home valuation process with new tools for consumers and data assessments to identify and stop biased assessors, as well as boost diversity in the appraiser profession.

Senate votes to overturn Biden’s student loan relief program,Summer Concepcion,"June 1, 2023, 2:27 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 6:16 PM UTC",Congress,"The Senate voted largely along party lines Thursday on legislation to block President Joe Biden’s student debt relief program after the measure cleared a key procedural hurdle in the chamber. The 52-46 vote to pass the legislation comes a day after senators took a similarly close vote to proceed to the measure, which would repeal Biden’s debt relief program and end the administration’s pause on federal student loan payments. A few moderate senators — Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana and independent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — voted with Republicans on the final passage vote as well as the motion to take up the measure. Just a simple majority of senators were needed to pass the legislation and send it to Biden's desk. But the White House warned in a Statement of Administration Policy last month that Biden would veto the resolution. “This resolution is an unprecedented attempt to undercut our historic economic recovery and would deprive more than 40 million hard-working Americans of much-needed student debt relief,” the statement said. The House passed the measure last week in a 218-203 vote, largely along party lines, with two Democrats — Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington — joining Republicans in supporting the measure. The resolution would repeal the administration’s program to cancel up to $10,000 in loans for borrowers whose income falls below certain levels and up to $20,000 for those who received Pell Grants. The resolution would also end a pandemic-era pause on loan payments and interest accrual. The biggest test for Biden's student loan relief plan, however, could still be ahead. The Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, is expected to rule on two cases on Biden’s debt relief plan this month. The debt ceiling legislation negotiated by Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., which passed the House on Wednesday and heads to the Senate, would resume payments on federal student loans that were paused at the start of the pandemic. Payments would resume at the end of August if the debt bill is signed into law. But the debt legislation would not block Biden’s debt forgiveness plan, despite GOP-led attempts to include a provision to do so. Republicans have argued that the Biden administration’s student debt forgiveness program burdens taxpayers and is unfair to those who paid off loans they borrowed or those who did not attend college. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the program would decrease the federal deficit by $315 billion in the next decade. The Biden administration, on the other hand, has argued in a statement that the cost of higher education has become a “lifelong burden” on low- and middle-income Americans, and therefore debt relief would provide borrowers with “breathing room” after the pandemic and accompanying economic crisis have passed.

Ron DeSantis loses his temper with a reporter: 'Are you blind?',Jonathan Allen,"June 1, 2023, 3:09 PM UTC",2024 Election,"LACONIA, N.H. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lashed out at a reporter — twice barking “Are you blind?” — at the end of his first campaign event in New Hampshire on Thursday. DeSantis, who delivered his stock stump speech to an audience of more than 100 people at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Laconia, became noticeably agitated when Steve Peoples of The Associated Press asked why he wasn’t taking questions from the audience like most presidential candidates do in this state. “People are coming up to me, talking to me,” DeSantis said. “What are you talking about? Are you blind? Are you blind? People are coming up to me, talking to me whatever they want to talk to me about.” At the time, DeSantis was shaking hands and taking pictures with individual members of the crowd on his way out of the VFW hall. But he did not answer questions from his lectern so that voters could all hear his answers at once. That decision was surprising and frustrating to some Republicans who came to hear DeSantis speak. “There weren’t questions or any interactivity with the audience,” said Vikram Mansharamani, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for the GOP Senate nomination in New Hampshire last year. “We like to hear from candidates and we have questions of our own [as] citizens here in the state.” Mansharamani praised DeSantis for tackling topics of interest to voters, but — shown the video of the Florida governor after the speech — he said it’s not what he wanted to see. “I find that very disappointing,” he said.

McCarthy proves his naysayers wrong,Scott Wong,"June 1, 2023, 8:30 AM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 2:35 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — Critics doubted Kevin McCarthy could win the speaker’s gavel, but he did after a historic 15 rounds of voting. They predicted McCarthy, R-Calif., wouldn’t be able to cobble together enough votes to pass his GOP plan to lift the debt ceiling, but he pushed it through without a single vote to spare. And some believed the speaker’s demands for spending cuts in his negotiations with President Joe Biden would throw the nation and the U.S. economy into a catastrophic default. Instead, the two men struck a deal. The bill still needs to pass through the Democratic-controlled Senate to become law, but McCarthy shepherded it through what was widely viewed as its toughest hurdle Wednesday night: passing the House. ""I’ve been thinking about this day before my vote for speaker, because I knew the debt ceiling was coming,"" McCarthy said Wednesday night. ""I wanted to make history. I wanted to do something no other Congress has done — that we would literally turn the ship, that for the first time, in quite some time, we’d spend less than we spent the year before."" In his first five months in power, McCarthy has defied the naysayers time and again. Asked whether his critics had underestimated him, McCarthy appeared to relish the question and poked fun at the media who have speculated he could fail to stave off a debt default or be forced out of the speaker’s office by his foes. “Every time I walk out [of my office], you tell me … ‘Are you going to get the bill? Are you going to be thrown out?’” McCarthy said Wednesday. “I kind of like it — you guys are worried every day.” Allies who have served with him in the House for years said McCarthy has a knack for knowing where his 222-member GOP Conference stands on any given issue — a skill he has developed while holding the roles of chief deputy whip, GOP whip, majority and minority leader and, finally, speaker. “He listens to everyone in the conference. He brings people together. He figures out where the sweet spot is, where we can all be as a team,” Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, the GOP campaign chairman, said in an interview. “He’s held a lot of different leadership positions, and he’s gotten wiser and smarter as he’s gone along, and he’s watched other leaders.” Another ally, Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, said McCarthy has “demonstrated resolve” — during both the prolonged floor fight for speaker and his monthslong standoff with Biden over the debt ceiling. “The president said, ‘I will not negotiate on the debt level.’ He did. The president said, ‘You will not get this.’ We got it. There’s many examples: work requirements, energy permitting reform, spending cuts,” Pfluger said. “I think he’s demonstrated resolve. I think he’s negotiated well. This is a win. It’s a solid, solid first down. The work is just beginning.” Across the Capitol, some GOP senators also cheered. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who served six years in the House alongside McCarthy, said he appreciated McCarthy’s negotiating team securing a pay-as-you-go, or “paygo,” rule that would require new federal agencies to offset new policies that boost spending (though it could be waived) and a provision to cap spending through stopgap measures if the annual dozen government spending bills aren’t passed by the end of the year. “For anybody that’s critical of Kevin … I think they’re wrong,” Cramer said. “I think he got everything he could get. It was a remarkable accomplishment.” Even with a huge legislative win in hand, McCarthy’s not entirely in the clear. Seventy-one Republicans voted against the debt ceiling deal, a little less than a third of McCarthy's caucus, with many saying its spending cuts were too modest and the most conservative members calling it a victory for Biden. And while one political enemy, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has said a push to oust McCarthy is “not” very likely, some members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus openly support forcing a vote of no confidence on the floor, known as a motion to vacate, which would remove him as speaker with a simple majority vote. ""The discussion about the motion to vacate is going to happen in the next week or two. ... Stay tuned,"" Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told reporters after the vote. If Democrats throw their support behind McCarthy in a vote of no confidence, Buck said it would be like ""a date with a eunuch."" Asked to elaborate, he said, ""He does not have much power when he relies on Democrats to keep him speaker."" Other Freedom Caucus leaders offered more veiled attacks on McCarthy without revealing their next move. “His new coalition is with the Democrats,” former Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., one of the so-called Never Kevins, said Wednesday. But a critical ally and a key GOP debt negotiator, Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., argued that McCarthy is in a stronger position than before and that critics continue to doubt him at their own risk. “Underestimated for damn sure. Kevin McCarthy has always been underestimated. Always been underestimated. The week of the speaker’s vote. The whole negotiation, the lack of negotiation. There’s been multiple times this calendar year alone that he’s been underestimated,” McHenry told reporters. The successful vote on the debt deal proves “why that is the wrong proposition here in Washington,” McHenry said at a news briefing with the other GOP negotiator, Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana. Graves said: “The White House miscalculated on this one. They misjudged the speaker. He is hands down the best strategist I’ve ever worked with.” "
Special counsel has obtained a tape of Trump discussing a classified document he kept after leaving office,Ken Dilanian,"June 1, 2023, 2:09 PM UTC",Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON — Special counsel Jack Smith's office has obtained a recording of former President Donald Trump discussing a classified planning document that he had taken from his time at the White House, a source directly familiar with the matter told NBC News. The planning document Trump kept was related to Iran, the source said, and the former president acknowledged on the tape that it was classified. The recording was made in July 2021 during a meeting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that included people who were helping former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows write his memoir, the source said. The tape was played during testimony provided to the grand jury that has been investigating Trump's handling of classified documents, the source added. The evidence appears to undercut Trump’s claim that he declassified all the government documents that came into his possession after he left the White House, and it would be important in any effort by prosecutors to prove that Trump knew he possessed classified information. News that federal officials had obtained the audio recording was first reported by CNN. NBC News has not heard the recording. The special counsel's investigation into Trump, which focuses on his alleged mishandling of more than 100 classified documents that were discovered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last year, appears to be approaching an end. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, rebuffing allegations that he mishandled classified documents. He claimed last year that he can declassify documents “by thinking about it.” FBI agents said in a redacted affidavit last year that they found 184 unique documents that had classification markings in the 15 boxes that Trump returned to the National Archives in January. The affidavit stated that 25 documents were marked as “TOP SECRET,” 67 documents marked as “confidential” and 92 marked “secret.” That then led to the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago by FBI agents who recovered a trove of top secret and other highly classified documents, court documents unsealed by a federal judge said. During that search, which Trump characterized as a “raid,” federal agents removed 11 additional sets of classified documents, including some that were labeled secret and top secret. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith as the special counsel in November, saying that the move was in the public’s interest “based on recent developments, including Trump’s announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election, and the current president’s intention to be a candidate in the next election.” "
New Mexico grand jury charges ex-GOP candidate with election interference in shootings at lawmakers’ homes,Associated Press,"June 1, 2023, 1:05 PM UTC",Politics News,"SANTA FE, N.M. — A failed political candidate has been indicted on federal charges, including election interference, in connection with a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of state and local lawmakers in Albuquerque, according to a grand jury indictment that was unsealed Wednesday. The indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Albuquerque takes aim at former Republican candidate Solomon Peña and two alleged accomplices with additional conspiracy and weapons-related charges in connection with the shootings in December 2022 and January of this year on the homes of four Democratic officials, including the current state House speaker. The attacks came amid a surge of threats and acts of intimidation against election workers and public officials across the country after former President Donald Trump and his allies spread false claims about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. U.S. Attorney Alexander Uballez highlighted that the shootings targeted the homes of two county commissioners shortly after their certification of the 2022 election. “Peña targeted several of these public officials because, in their official capacity, they certified the election, which he lost,” Uballez said at a news conference. “In America, voters pick their leaders and would-be leaders don’t get to pick which voters they heed, which rules apply to them, or which laws to follow.” No one was injured in the shootings. But in one case bullets passed through the bedroom of a state senator’s 10-year-old daughter. The new indictment outlines smart-phone communications including text messages by Peña in the days following the Nov. 8, 2022, election that pinpoint the locations of officials’ homes, allege election-rigging and confide to a politically ally about plans to “press the attack.” Text messages in the indictment show the 40-year-old candidate bristling with outrage as Bernalillo County commissions certified the results of the midterm election and his own overwhelming defeat as candidate for a seat in the state House of Representatives. Federal authorities say Peña hired others to conduct the shootings and carried out at least one shooting himself. Hours before the first shooting on Dec. 4, 2022, Peña texted a Republican political ally, who also lost a bid for state representative, to say that “we have to act. I’m continuing my study of election rigging. The enemy will eventually break.” Amid the shootings, Peña later texted one of several unnamed conspirators in the indictment to say, “It is our duty as Statesmen and Patriots, to stop the oligarchs from taking over our country.” Elizabeth Honce, a defense attorney for Peña, said her client maintains his innocence. Peña has been held without bail since his January arrest on charges in state district court related to the shootings. Those charges will be dismissed in deference to the federal indictment as Peña is transferred to federal custody, authorities said. Federal charges were also filed against 22-year-old Jose Louise Trujillo and 41-year-old Demetrio Trujillo on allegations that they assisted Peña in obtaining vehicles and firearms — and that they “pulled the trigger themselves to fire bullets into the homes of the victims.” Jose Trujillo was arrested in January on an outstanding warrant in a car with a stash of more than 800 fentanyl pills and two firearms, leading to a break in the investigation as officers traced at least one gun to bullet casings found the same day at one of the shootings. Authorities say Demetrio Trujillo was arrested Wednesday, while they declined to comment directly on whether several unnamed accomplices in the indictment would be charged. John Anderson, an attorney for Jose Trujillo, declined to comment on the indictment when contacted Wednesday. Police have described Peña as the instigator of a politically motivated conspiracy leading to shootings at the homes of two county commissioners and two state legislators. Charges against the three defendants include the use of an automatic weapon. The shootings began Dec. 4, when eight rounds were fired at the home of Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa. Days later, state Rep. Javier Martínez’s home was targeted. On Dec. 11, more than a dozen rounds were fired at the home of Bernalillo County Commissioner Debbie O’Malley, police said. Martínez became the Democratic state House speaker in January. The final related shooting, targeting state Sen. Linda Lopez’s home, unfolded in the midnight hour of Jan. 3. Police said more than a dozen shots were fired, including three that Lopez said passed through the bedroom of her sleeping daughter. Maggie Toulouse Oliver, New Mexico secretary of state, said she was “pleased to see the federal government pursuing this case with the seriousness it deserves.” Following the shootings, New Mexico state lawmakers this year enacted legislation that provides felony sanctions for intimidation of election regulators and allows some public officials and political candidates to keep their home address off government websites. Recent assaults on politicians or their households include the hammer-wielding attack on the husband of them-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in October 2022 at the couple’s San Francisco home. In July 2022, a man clutching a pointed weapon assaulted Republican candidate for New York Gov. Lee Zeldin — a congressman at the time — on stage at a speaking event. "
Ron DeSantis' security becomes a flashpoint for Florida’s top police agency,Matt Dixon,"June 1, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",2024 Election,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida's top law enforcement agency is diverting waves of additional resources toward Gov. Ron DeSantis — for both his protection and his priorities — including adding more agents and spending more money as the governor begins frequent national travel for his presidential campaign. Top officials insist the increase is not entirely to do with the governor's national political ambitions. Instead, they say, they are simply realigning resources after mismanagement by past leaders. But that's hitting fierce pushback from some of those same past leaders, including from a former department commissioner and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who previously served as governor for two terms. It’s exceedingly rare for the former Florida Department of Law Enforcement commissioner and the former governor to speak publicly in a way that contradicts the current agency leadership, underscoring the growing nature of the political clash in Florida. The finger-pointing comes at a time when the FDLE's resources are being spread thinner because of the increased focus on protecting DeSantis as his presidential campaign begins and its increased focus on undocumented immigration — a top political priority for DeSantis that he regularly uses to criticize President Joe Biden, which is fueling the perception that the agency is becoming politicized. The efforts include stationing agents in the Florida Keys to watch for mostly Cuban migrants approaching Florida’s shores and sending teams of 40 to the southern border in Texas as part of a broader mission DeSantis said is aimed at preventing illegal border crossings. FDLE officials told NBC News that changes to the agency were a long time coming, a result of recommendations that Commissioner Mark Glass put together shortly after being tapped for the job by DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet in August 2022. It was not, they insisted, in response to DeSantis' national political ambitions. “Unfortunately, the team Commissioner Glass put together during his transition found that after nearly a decade FDLE had failed to request necessary additional resources in Protective Operations while the threats nationwide have increased, leaving the section critically underfunded, and in many cases, understaffed,” Gretl Plessinger, the department’s communications director, said. The idea that the department’s so-called protective services — the term for operations focused on protecting the governor, the governor's family and any out-of-state visiting dignitaries — was strained for resources during the past decade came as news to Scott, who preceded DeSantis as governor. Scott, who at times has had tension with DeSantis, told NBC News that during his eight years as governor, he never had issues with the details that protected him. “I had a great working relationship with FDLE and the agents of the protective detail,” Scott said when asked to respond to FDLE’s statement. “Their protective and investigative work was an important part of Florida hitting record low crime rates over my eight years as governor.” “The agents of FDLE are dedicated, hard working and committed to their mission to protect all Floridians and I appreciate every employee and agent at FDLE who is focused on making Florida the safest state in the nation,” he added. Plessinger did not respond to requests for comment on Scott’s statement. She also did not respond to follow-up questions about whether DeSantis' increased out-of-state travel leading up to his May 24 presidential launch put a strain on resources, what the expected current year protective services costs are, or whether changes in policy came after protesters got onstage with DeSantis in April — an exceptionally rare occurrence for any governor. During that event at a fundraising dinner in New Hampshire, two protesters climbed onstage chanting, ""Jews against DeSantis."" “Regardless of the number of resources allocated to [protective services], under my tenure, protesters were never allowed to make it onstage with the governor,” said Rick Swearingen, who served as FDLE commissioner from 2014 until his retirement in mid-2022. “Perhaps leadership and management of resources is just as important as the number of resources.” Speaking publicly for the first time since his retirement, Swearingen said the idea that FDLE failed to request resources for protective operations over the past decade, as FDLE’s current leadership contends, is “simply not supported by facts.” He pointed to spending cuts the department needed to make on his watch due to the annual state budget process. Even when lawmakers made cuts, he said, the protective services budget was always spared. “Having dealt with legislative sessions for years, their appetite for spending fluctuated greatly from session to session,” Swearingen said. “In recent years, FDLE was forced to make significant spending cuts including general revenue dollars that impacted investigative services.” Swearingen announced his retirement just weeks after DeSantis signed legislation allowing the governor and a majority of the Florida Cabinet to appoint a new FDLE commissioner. At the time, it meant that DeSantis and the three-person Florida Cabinet could appoint a new FDLE head without the vote of the then-only Democrat, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried. State records show that spending on protecting the governor and his family has fluctuated over the years but has steadily increased. It went from $2.1 million in the fiscal year ending in June 2012 to just over $6 million during the last fiscal year, which ended in June 2022. The $6 million figure is an increase of $1.1 million over DeSantis’ first full year as governor, and $1.3 million more than his second full year in office, which was affected by the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Though Plessinger did not respond to follow-up questions, members who served on Glass’ transition team said their concern was less about protective services being “critically underfunded,” as Plessinger put it, and more about the idea that protective services needed to be more centralized, rather than the more patchwork regional approach that relied on leadership from regions across the state. One of the recommendations they put forward to Glass was to hire a protective services director to help streamline the operation, according to the transition report. “One of the common themes was that everyone in the regions were completely exhausted from years of protective services, so I asked, ‘When did this start?’” said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey, who chaired Glass’ transition team. “Some said it went back to the Jeb Bush days, others said the amount of travel with Rick Scott. The unit had not grown in a long time, and there was frustration.” Coral Gables Police Chief Ed Hudak, another member of Glass’ transition team, said it was not that they found protective services “drastically underfunded,” but that it needed to adjust to “dramatically different types of threats.” “Our response to certain things on the protective ops side was that you need to centralize your protective services,” he said. “I’m not comfortable saying it was just underfunded. FDLE was being asked to do more and more.” He also said that as Glass’ transition team completed its work in mid-to-late 2022, a potential DeSantis presidential bid had already gotten significant buzz and was something that was part of the thought process. “We anticipated him announcing, and he did,” Hudak said of the transition team. “That will put more of a burden on FDLE. A lot of that was already in the mix, but it was something that needed to be considered.” Swearingen, the former FDLE commissioner, is not the only former FDLE official to criticize the department’s current leadership. “There has been a push of trying to get FDLE to focus on topics the governor has highlighted, specifically immigration as the primary one,” said Jim Madden, a retired FDLE assistant commissioner. “It is sad. We have fought those battles over the years about agency priorities and where it should focus, but right now in my mind, leadership there is just wholly inadequate. There is no solid independence with the agency."" He said the agency is becoming more and more politicized, and when the focus turns to those types of initiatives, it hurts resources for the department’s broader law enforcement mission. “That always happens when you have these focuses on single-issue initiatives” like immigration, Madden added. In January, DeSantis signed an executive order that, in part, directed state law enforcement “to provide resources in support of local governments responding to the alarming influx of migrants landing in the Florida Keys.” The order sent both Florida National Guard and FDLE resources to the Florida Keys after roughly 300 migrants mostly from Cuba landed at a national park there. At the time, DeSantis was starting to really gear up the early stages of planning for his run for president and blamed “Biden’s lawless immigration policies.” Gretl Plessinger, FDLE’s communications director, said the agency sent resources to the Keys as a result of the executive order, and “we expect this deployment to continue.” Teams of 40 FDLE agents are also doing two-week deployments along the U.S.-Mexico border as part of DeSantis’ response to Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requesting help for border security efforts.The beefed-up FDLE security presence was on full display Wednesday during DeSantis’ swing through Iowa, when more than half a dozen agents were often with him at his events — a security presence unusual for a governor.

"A break-glass option, gumbo and a bike ride: How the debt ceiling deal got done",Peter Nicholas,"June 1, 2023, 2:00 AM UTC",Congress,"Right up until the end, the White House was exploring contingency plans in case the high-stakes talks with Republicans to raise the debt ceiling and avert economic disaster collapsed. The White House was considering the unprecedented step of bypassing Congress altogether and invoking the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which states that “the validity of the public debt … shall not be questioned.” President Joe Biden worried that there wasn’t enough time for the inevitable court challenge to play out if he went down that road. But he took the idea seriously — so seriously that the White House counsel’s office consulted at least two outside legal experts about the 14th Amendment just days before the deal was announced, people familiar with the matter said. A lead House negotiator in the showdown with Biden, Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., told reporters Wednesday that had Republicans spurned negotiations and let the nation default on its debt, it would have resulted “in the president trying to invoke the 14th Amendment,” as well as a missed opportunity for Republicans to press for spending cuts. But that break-glass option wouldn’t be needed. Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced a deal Saturday night, and the House passed it Wednesday, capping a 36-day scramble at the White House and on Capitol Hill to avert economic catastrophe ahead of the Treasury Department’s deadline of Monday. Senate leaders are working to pass the measure quickly. The House passage was a big hurdle, though it’s possible there could be turbulence in the Senate. Breaching the debt ceiling would roil the global financial markets. It would wipe out jobs and plunge the U.S. into a recession. Default would shatter the common presumption after World War II that America would always make good on its obligations. There had been two close calls in the Obama presidency, but default had never happened before. This time, there was good reason to worry that the U.S. would tumble over the cliff. After all, months went by before the high-wire talks even took place. Biden refused to meet with McCarthy until House Republicans put forward a budget that would be the basis for negotiations. And then, in April, McCarthy did just that. Democratic leaders were stunned. For months they’d been taunting McCarthy, challenging him to unify the fractious Republican caucus and pass a bill. McCarthy had been demanding spending cuts in return for raising the debt ceiling, a necessary step to avoid a catastrophic default. But if he couldn’t so much as produce a bill laying out what he wanted, there was nothing to discuss, Democrats argued. “What are they going to talk about, the weather?” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., quipped repeatedly in March. Both sides were dug in. Biden’s stance was simple if ultimately untenable: He wouldn’t negotiate over the debt ceiling. Dusting off a metaphor from the Obama era, he said he wouldn’t let Republicans hold the U.S. economy hostage in exchange for concessions. Republicans had to raise the debt ceiling; case closed. Then McCarthy, who’d gotten the speaker’s job three months earlier after a tense 15 rounds of voting, muscled through a debt ceiling bill with just one vote to spare on April 26. The White House reaction, according to three Democratic sources on Capitol Hill, was “flat-footed” and “surprised.” Biden had “underestimated” McCarthy’s influence in his conference, one said. (A White House aide said Wednesday that Biden and his senior advisers had been conferring with congressional Democrats all along, part of a strategy meant to force Republicans to release a plan of their own. “We weren’t going to negotiate with ourselves,” an official said.) Each side looked at the other with suspicion, if not outright contempt. Biden worried that the House’s far-right lawmakers were perfectly happy to see the economy collapse if only to damage his re-election chances. Back when he was vice president, Biden would reach out to an old colleague from his Senate days, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, to cut budget deals. They were the closers. This time, McConnell was sitting it out. It was up to Biden and McCarthy to break the impasse, McConnell maintained. It was time to start negotiating, and Biden knew it. But it wouldn’t be easy. “You’ve got two Irish guys that don’t drink,” Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., another key negotiator, said of Biden and McCarthy on Wednesday. This account of the fevered negotiations that followed as the nation careened toward default stems from interviews with more than two dozen lawmakers, outside advisers and congressional and White House aides. Many spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal strategy surrounding the talks. “Everyone in Washington is going to look terrible if we were actually to go over the brink and default,” former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said in the days before the deal was reached. To win the speaker’s job, McCarthy had to placate both moderates and a right-wing faction closely aligned with former President Donald Trump, who called on Republicans to let the country default unless all their demands — including the “kitchen sink” — were met. Any one member can force a vote to oust him under the strict terms in which McCarthy was chosen. That gave McCarthy little room for error as he plunged into the most delicate and far-reaching negotiations of his career. He and other congressional leaders met with Biden in the Oval Office on May 9, when anxieties were rising. By that point, the deadline for default was only four weeks away. Biden was dropping his refusal to negotiate, and employed a bit of verbal gymnastics to mask his retreat. He insisted he was bargaining over spending levels — not a ransom for avoiding default. But Biden was negotiating in deadly earnest to stave off economic calamity. The key points of the emerging Biden-McCarthy deal were laid out just two days later, on May 11, at a low-key news briefing in the Capitol. Graves told reporters that he saw four main areas where a deal could be reached: reforming how permits are issued, clawing back unspent Covid funds, capping spending and imposing new work requirements on people getting federal aid. Soon afterward, McCarthy tapped Graves to lead negotiations with the White House. Biden, meanwhile, deputized several trusted aides to lead the talks on his behalf: senior adviser Steve Ricchetti, legislative affairs chief Louisa Terrell and budget director Shalanda Young, a former congressional aide who hails from the Baton Rouge district Graves represents. The two Louisianans developed a rapport and began cooking up a deal. “He said he makes better gumbo than me, so we were really trying to hash that out,” Young said as she left a meeting with Graves in the Capitol. “She conceded,” Graves said later after the deal was struck. “It’s all about the roux.” As both sides inched toward a deal, they faced mounting resentment from inside their ranks. After he left a meeting with Biden on May 16, McCarthy sounded upbeat, predicting that a deal could come together by the end of the week. That worried conservatives who feared that McCarthy would negotiate on the margins rather than insist on sweeping budget cuts — or that Republican leaders would use budget “gimmicks” to forge a deal they could sell to their caucus as the deadline loomed. They agreed they would need to ensure that McCarthy held the line, according to sources familiar with the conversations. A behind-the-scenes player in the bubbling conservative revolt was Russell Vought, who was a budget director in Trump’s White House. He had the ear of lawmakers who were skeptical of McCarthy’s willingness to deliver real cuts, said a person familiar with the talks. Vought was instrumental in leading the fight for speaker that forced McCarthy through so many rounds of votes. Working with budget hawks based in conservative think tanks — who view the fight as part of a larger battle within the party over whether cuts to federal spending matter — GOP hard-liners ramped up pressure on McCarthy to hold fast. They preferred a deal that would lift the debt ceiling for only one year rather than two, giving themselves more leverage with Biden when he was up for re-election in 2024. Heeding the warnings from conservatives, House negotiators pressed “pause” on May 19 after, they said, the White House stood firm against budget cuts. They briefly left the negotiating table and returned with a tougher public line. “Washington has to spend less. It’s as simple as that,” McCarthy tweeted. Budget hawks were pleased by the pause. A source familiar with the talks described it as a negotiation tactic and said Republican leaders needed to make sure they shored up members on spending cuts, with 50 to 60 members holding a hard-line position on the issue, the source said. The source said they were still with McCarthy, however, and members maintained that public unity. Graves later said the moment was worrying. “We effectively threw them out,” he said, referring to the White House negotiators. “That was probably a low point. Meetings got pretty tense at that point, language got pretty intense.” The pause came roughly overnight in Japan — where Biden was taking part in a meeting with the leaders of other advanced democracies. Biden’s team, briefing him at odd hours back home because of the 13-hour time difference, viewed the GOP’s position as a troubling step backward, according to White House officials. McCarthy was in a tough spot; he needed to appease the far right. The debt ceiling deal would have to pass both the House and the Senate. A Senate conservative, Mike Lee of Utah, warned that he would use “every procedural tool” to delay a deal that lacked “substantial reform.” Meanwhile, Democrats fretted that Biden was losing the messaging war. McCarthy was everywhere. He would hold lengthy news conferences at the White House after his meetings with Biden, then moments later do the same thing with reporters in the Capitol. As he walked the halls of the Capitol, he’d stop and chat informally with reporters. Biden wasn’t nearly as accessible. And unlike President Barack Obama during the 2011 debt ceiling fight, Biden never gave a prime-time address devoted to the crisis. “Where the White House failed miserably is in filling the messaging void,” a Democratic lawmaker said in the days before the agreement was reached. “Kevin [McCarthy] is out there every day. There’s no response. There’s no frame. There’s nothing. Is he [Biden] absent? Is it ‘Weekend at Bernie’s’? Where is the guy?” There was a reason for Biden’s silence, White House officials countered. His focus was on getting a deal, and he worried that too many speeches lambasting Republicans might jeopardize the talks, aides said. White House advisers characterized his approach this way: “Prioritize the win.” Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders scrambled. On the evening of May 22, as Biden and McCarthy met at the White House, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., huddled with his top lieutenants in his Capitol office to discuss strategy: They would parry McCarthy with daily news conferences accusing “extreme MAGA Republicans” of risking a default that would tank the economy. Three days later, nearly 90 Democrats gathered on the floor to excoriate their GOP counterparts for having left town for the Memorial Day weekend without a deal. Still, most Americans didn’t appear to grasp the dire stakes. Many seemed to believe a default would be akin to a government shutdown, which the U.S. has been through numerous times in recent years. Default, by contrast, would reverberate worldwide. While people scoured the web more frequently as the talks lurched forward, their searches focused more on government shutdowns than on the consequences of default, according to data gathered by FiscalNote’s Predata. On the Friday morning before the long Memorial Day weekend, McCarthy and Graves bicycled 10 miles together in Washington, circling the National Mall and points south. It was Graves’ second workout of the day. Earlier, he told colleagues in the House gym that negotiators were “close” but still had differences over permitting reform and spending caps. Around midnight, Graves emerged from the speaker’s suite in the Capitol with a cup of coffee and gummy worms in hand, fortifying himself for the long night ahead. (Asked Wednesday what he did to keep his sanity over weeks of tense talks, he joked: “Let’s be clear, I wasn’t sane.” He also confessed that the bike had been stolen, or borrowed, from the police. “I did return it, so I feel like it’s more of a borrow,” he said.) The next day, Saturday, McCarthy and his fellow negotiators left the Capitol together to get lunch from Chipotle, bringing back chips and queso for the reporters camped outside the speaker’s office. Biden was at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, where he consulted with aides and signed off on various offers and counterproposals, a White House official said. The two sides announced the breakthrough Saturday night — a deal that neither set of negotiators loved but both could accept. Biden prevailed on one important point: The debt ceiling would be suspended a full two years, meaning he wouldn’t need to negotiate all over again as he ran for re-election in 2024. The backlash was immediate. Liberals deemed the cuts and the work requirements to get federal aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, too severe; conservatives, too modest. When McCarthy appeared on Fox News on Sunday to say a  majority of his conference supported the deal, a House Republican texted a reporter to rebut him in real time. The lawmaker wrote: “That’s a lie. Text [of the bill] hasn’t even come out yet and I already know of more than that.” McCarthy’s goal was to show confidence and limit Republican defections. They knew the bill would require Democratic votes — the aim was to minimize the need for them. McCarthy and his allies sought to arm members with a talking point by leaking a Congressional Budget Office finding — conveyed privately to GOP leadership, according to two sources — that the legislation would lead to $2.1 trillion in cuts if the six-year targets were met. That was a sleight of hand: Only two years of caps would be binding; the rest were aspirational. GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York hosted a call Monday afternoon in which she repeatedly emphasized the broad ideological mix of lawmakers who were on it to support the bill. In the end, it won 149 Republican votes. Democrats largely played coy, refusing to say how many votes they’d help provide. Progressives vented their concerns in a private call Monday about “fossil fuel permitting, work requirements and spending cuts,” a source on the call said. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., opposed the bill but proclaimed before the vote that “many House progressives have said if they need our vote, we’ll be there.” It was emblematic of the party mood. Democrats weren’t happy, but there was no way they would tank Biden’s deal and force a default. (The final tally: 165 Democratic lawmakers voted “yes.”) After two years in which the White House largely had to negotiate differences between progressives and conservative Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, corralling votes for the debt deal required a new approach, focused on a key center-left block. One of the first calls Biden made after the deal was announced was to Rep. Ann McLane Kuster, D-N.H., the chair of the 98-member New Democratic Coalition. As they two discussed selling the deal to fellow Democrats, Kuster said she focused not on what the White House got from the negotiations but rather how “we got everything out of the agreement” that Republicans had been pushing to enact. On Memorial Day, two days before the big vote, Kuster and her group issued a statement championing the bill. Wednesday morning, White House officials made one final pitch to Democrats for support at a caucus meeting on Capitol Hill. Before Young, the Biden negotiator, made a presentation, she got a standing ovation from the caucus that “brought her to tears,” a source in the room said. The group also heard from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who still enjoys great influence in the caucus but has been reluctant to wield it publicly, for fear of undermining the new leadership. Pelosi “gave an impassioned plea” to the caucus to support the deal, the source said — words that resonated all the more because of the relatively low profile she has kept since she relinquished a leadership role. Still, there were clear differences in the room. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., criticized the changes to anti-poverty programs like SNAP and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. She said that Black women are always being disrespected and that “you have your foot on our neck” with the bill. Pelosi “explained that it wasn’t the bill we would draft on our own, but that it was the best we could do,” another source said. Painful as the standoff was, the House passed the 99-page Fiscal Responsibility Act on Wednesday night in a whopping 314-117 vote. There would be no economic meltdown — at least not yet. No other democratic nation except Denmark has a similar debt ceiling. Congress could do away with it if it chose. But lawmakers have preserved it: Republicans like to wield it as leverage when they don’t control the White House, and Democrats never found the support to abolish it while in charge. ""There will be a Republican president in the future who’s going to need to raise the debt ceiling,” said Jim Kessler, a co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way. “I don’t think Democrats are going to say, ‘We’re just going to allow you to do it.’ They’ll draw concessions, too. Democrats will start playing that card when it’s their turn."" “If it gets bad enough,” he added, “we’ll do the smart thing and repeal this silly law.” "
Biden-McCarthy debt ceiling bill passes the House and will head to the Senate,Sahil Kapur,"May 31, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 1:57 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — With overwhelming bipartisan support, the House voted Wednesday to pass the debt ceiling legislation negotiated by Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden, sending it to the Senate with days to spare before a potentially disastrous default. The vote was 314 to 117, with 149 Republicans joining 165 Democrats. The bill would extend the debt limit for two years alongside a two-year budget agreement if it is signed into law. It is the culmination of months of political warfare and weeks of frenzied negotiations between the two parties that finally broke a lengthy stalemate. The deal overcame heavy criticism from GOP hard-liners, who argued that its spending cuts and conservative provisions are too weak. It also faced opposition from Democrats, who criticized the added work requirements and nondefense spending cuts negotiated by the two men. “You are getting so many wins for the American people in this bill,” said McCarthy, R-Calif., who hailed it as a measure that “moves us in the right direction” fiscally. He said his message to fellow Republicans on Wednesday was: “You’re not spending more money. There’s no new government programs. There’s no tax increases. There’s nothing in the bill that you really should be negative about.” Follow along for live updates Biden praised its passage. ""This budget agreement is a bipartisan compromise,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Neither side got everything it wanted. That’s the responsibility of governing."" The bill now goes to the Democratic-led Senate, where it needs 60 votes before it can get to Biden’s desk. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have both endorsed it and called for speedy passage. The White House has urged passage of the bill as the U.S. nears Monday's deadline to act or risk an economically catastrophic default on the nation's debt. The deal includes modest spending cuts, and it would suspend the borrowing limit to Jan. 1, 2025 — with the Treasury then able to use extraordinary measures to pay the bills. House Republican leaders always expected to lose some votes, mostly from hard-right members who say the deal isn't aggressive enough at delivering spending cuts. That meant some Democrats were needed to get it over the finish line. “House Democrats are going to make sure that the country does not default — period, full stop,” said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. “We will continue to be responsible stewards of our economy. And we will not let middle-class Americans, working families, those who aspire to be part of the middle class, seniors, veterans, the poor, the sick and the afflicted be hurt by a dangerous GOP-manufactured default.” The legislation would cap spending for the next two years. It includes conservative measures that would claw back about $28 billion in unspent Covid relief funds, eliminate $1.4 billion in IRS funding and shift roughly $20 billion of the $80 billion the IRS got through the Inflation Reduction Act to nondefense funding. The bill would also restart federal student loan payments after a lengthy pause that began at the start of the pandemic. And it would add work requirements for people up to 55 years old to get benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (the current threshold is 50 years old), with carve-outs for veterans and homeless people. The Biden-McCarthy agreement wouldn't make changes to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that if the bill's spending caps and targets are followed, it would reduce federal discretionary spending by $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years. Only the first two years of spending levels would be binding under the legislation, however. The SNAP reforms would actually net a spending increase of $2.1 billion, the CBO found. The new work rules would save $6.5 billion, but the new exclusions for homeless people and veterans would add 78,000 people to SNAP benefit rolls and cost $8.6 billion. Hard-right members tore into the measure. Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., said the conservative policy provisions were ""fictionalized suggestions of change"" that are insignificant. ""In effect what they’ve done"" is a ""clean"" debt limit extension with no substantive policy additions, he argued, portraying it as a surrender to Biden's demands. ""And so there's nothing there,"" Bishop said. ""If you're going to do tacitly a clean debt ceiling, make it short."" Senators who oppose it, like Mike Lee, R-Utah, have procedural tools they could use to try to slow it down past Monday's deadline. Schumer has encouraged members to act quickly to avoid default. ""Senators should be prepared to move on this bill quickly once it is the Senate's turn to act. I cannot stress enough that we have no margin — no margin — for error,"" Schumer said Wednesday, warning that ""any needless delay, any last-minute brinkmanship"" could mean that ""the federal government will default for the first time ever."" McConnell quickly praised House passage of the bill on Twitter and added: “Now, it’s the Senate’s turn to pass this agreement without delay.” "
Pentagon is blocking U.S. cooperation with international investigations of war crimes in Ukraine,Dan De Luce,"June 1, 2023, 12:13 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"The Defense Department is blocking efforts by the U.S. government to share evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine with the International Criminal Court, a senior U.S. diplomat told lawmakers Wednesday. Beth Van Schaack, the State Department’s ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, said at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Pentagon continues to hold up U.S. cooperation with the Hague court in its investigations of suspected atrocities in Ukraine. When Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., asked Van Schaack whether it was the Pentagon that “is not cooperating in that way,” she replied: “Yes.” The Pentagon has harbored concerns that cooperation with the International Criminal Court could lead to the prosecution of U.S. troops deployed abroad. The New York Times first reported in March the Pentagon’s reluctance to share information about Ukraine with the ICC. The ICC opened an investigation into possible U.S. crimes in Afghanistan in 2017. The Trump administration immediately expressed outrage and imposed sanctions on the court’s prosecutor. Court officials later announced that the case against U.S forces in Afghanistan would receive lower priority. Van Schaack argued at Wednesday’s hearing that sharing relevant information about suspected war crimes in Ukraine with the Hague court would not raise potential legal risks for U.S. troops. She also pledged to fight any such effort by the court. “I’ll say at the outset that in my role as the lead diplomat in the international justice space, I would work tirelessly to ensure that no U.S. personnel will be brought before the ICC,” she said. ""I do not think that that is an acute risk at this time.” The ICC has also assured U.S. officials that if the U.S. legal system addresses possible war crimes committed by American troops, the Hague court would not see a need to intervene, she added. “I do not think,” she said, “that we are at all undermining our ability to robustly protect against any charges that might be brought.” "
Pentagon leaders cancel drag show at a Nevada Air Force base,Courtney Kube,"May 31, 2023, 10:16 PM UTC",National Security,"Defense Department leaders have stepped in to stop a drag show scheduled for Thursday at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, according to two defense officials and a U.S. official. The show, which was in celebration of Pride Month, was approved by Air Force leaders, but Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, told the Air Force it is not Pentagon policy to fund drag shows on bases and the show should be canceled or moved off base. Drag shows and events on military bases have become a politically contentious issue in recent months, with conservative politicians and pundits arguing the military should not be spending taxpayer money on them. At a House Armed Services Committee hearing on March 29, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., angrily questioned Austin and Milley about drag queen story hours on bases around the world, including in Montana, Nevada, Virginia and Germany. “Drag queen story hours is not something that the department funds,” Austin told the committee. Milley chimed in, asking to see the flyers for the events Gaetz was referring to and saying he was not aware of such events and does not support their being held on military bases. “I’d like to take a look at those, because I don’t agree with those,” Milley said. When Milley was informed about the event this week, he was visibly angry about the decision to host the event on base, a U.S. official and a defense official said. “Consistent with Secretary Austin’s congressional testimony, the Air Force will not host drag events at its installations or facilities. Commanders have been directed to either cancel or relocate these events to an off-base location,” an Air Force official said when asked about the Nellis event. “Per DoD Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), certain criteria must be met for persons or organizations acting in non-Federal capacity to use DoD facilities and equipment. As Secretary Austin has said, the DOD will not host drag events at U.S. military installations or facilities. Hosting these types of events in federally funded facilities is not a suitable use of DOD resources,” deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said in a statement. The Nellis drag show was scheduled for Thursday, but the base commander was informed in the past few days that it must either be canceled or moved off base, the officials said. “I can confirm the Nellis commander informed the private organization that the drag event would have to be canceled or relocated to an off-base location,” a source familiar with the matter said. Nellis AFB hosted a Pride Month drag show in June 2021, named “Drag-u-Nellis.” A spokesperson for the base said in a statement that it was intended to promote inclusivity and diversity. On May 23, Gaetz sent a letter about the issue to Austin and Milley, detailing six other cases of drag shows or events on bases or approved by the U.S. military. Gaetz asked the Pentagon leaders to provide information about the events and to say whether any punitive action has or will be taken against anyone who used taxpayer money on them. "
Abbott appoints interim attorney general in Texas following Paxton’s impeachment,Zoë Richards,"May 31, 2023, 10:15 PM UTC",Politics News,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday appointed former Secretary of State John Scott to temporarily serve as attorney general after the state House impeached Ken Paxton. “John Scott has the background and experience needed to step in as a short-term interim Attorney General during the time the Attorney General has been suspended from duty,” Abbott said in a statement Wednesday. “His decades of experience and expertise in litigation will help guide him while serving as the state’s top law enforcement officer.” Abbott, a Republican, made the interim appointment days after the state's GOP-controlled House voted 121-23 to impeach Paxton — with 60 of its 85 Republican members, including Speaker Dade Phelan, supporting his suspension on charges that include bribery and misuse of office. Paxton has been under FBI investigation for years in connection with allegations that he abused his office to help a donor. He is also awaiting trial on an indictment alleging state securities fraud from 2015. Paxton, who has denied any wrongdoing, called the impeachment proceedings a “politically motivated sham"" in a statement Saturday. The House has delivered articles of impeachment to the state Senate, which will hold a trial to decide whether Paxton should be permanently removed from office. The trial is expected to begin no later than Aug. 28, with a jury that could include his wife, Sen. Angela Paxton. Abbott — who did not refer to Paxton by name or comment on the impeachment in his statement appointing Scott — touted Scott's record as an attorney, saying he has ""handled cases at all levels of the justice system."" Scott, whom Abbott appointed secretary of state in late 2021, resigned last year after he oversaw the 2022 midterm elections as the top elections official and presided over an audit of the state's 2020 election results. Scott previously served as deputy attorney general for civil litigation when Abbott was attorney general. Scott was also once appointed as the state Health and Human Services Commission's chief operating officer. Paxton, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump who was first elected ’ attorney general in 2014, led a failed legal effort to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in four battleground states in 2020. He also backed Trump when Trump launched his White House re-election bid last year. Trump defended Paxton on his social media website, Truth Social, over the weekend, suggesting the proceedings were a form of election interference and a ""very unfair process."" "
NASA panel studying UFO sightings says stigma and poor data pose challenges,Denise Chow,"May 31, 2023, 6:19 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 9:33 PM UTC",UFOs and aerial phenomena,"A NASA panel tasked with studying reports of ""unidentified aerial phenomena"" said at a hearing that the stigma associated with reporting UFO sightings — as well as the harassment of people who work to investigate them — may be hindering efforts to determine their origins. The panel, which was formed last year, presented early findings Wednesday in the group’s first public meeting and is expected to publish a final report this summer. The team highlighted the need for more high-quality data to properly investigate unusual sightings. Daniel Evans, the assistant deputy associate administrator for research in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said there has been no convincing evidence that reports of UFOs have anything to do with aliens. While extraterrestrial origins are not being ruled out, the independent group was convened to address broader national security concerns, he said. ""There could potentially be very serious risks to U.S. airspace as a result of us not necessarily knowing what is in our skies at a given time,"" Evans said Wednesday in a news briefing. Evans also noted that the definition of UAPs, as they are referred to in government parlance, was recently expanded: Rather than only covering ""unidentified aerial phenomena,"" the designation now refers to ""unidentified anomalous phenomena"" in order to include mysterious undersea encounters and strange sightings in the outermost parts of the planet's atmosphere — a region known as ""near space."" Debates over potential UFO sightings have garnered increased attention in recent years, particularly as Congress and U.S. intelligence agencies have sought to make public more information about unidentified flying objects and data from reported incidents. Interest in these encounters has also increased due to the recent mysterious flying objects spotted in American airspace, including a Chinese spy balloon that was detected over Montana in February. Members of the public will be able to submit comments to NASA on the information presented at Wednesday's meeting beginning Friday morning. Sean Kirkpatrick, director of the Defense Department’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, said during the hearing that most reports of unidentified aerial phenomena have ""mundane"" explanations. Since 1996, he said, his office has received more than 800 reports of unidentified flying objects, but just an estimated 2% to 5% demonstrate ""anomalous characteristics"" that require further analysis, such as modeling, simulation or physical testing. The vast majority of the reports, Kirkpatrick said, are sightings of unusual orbs or round spheres, and most have been spotted at altitudes where aircraft typically fly. But he added that ""without sufficient data, we are unable to reach defendable conclusions that meet the highest scientific standards we set for resolution."" David Spergel, the panel's chair, said one of the biggest challenges in conducting research on UAPs is navigating public opinion on the topic. ""We have a community of people who are completely convinced of the existence of UFOs, and we have a community of people who think addressing this question is ridiculous,"" Spergel said. ""And I think as scientists, the way to approach questions is you start by saying, 'We don't know,' and then you collect data and you try to calibrate your data well."" The stigma that surrounds the practices of reporting and investigating unidentified aerial phenomena — whether for members of the public, commercial pilots or members of the military — isn't helping, according to NASA’s science chief, Nicola Fox. In her opening remarks at the hearing, Fox said members of the 16-person panel have faced harassment online for their participation in the work. ""Harassment only leads to further stigmatization of the UAP field, significantly hindering the scientific progress and discouraging others to study this important subject matter,"" she said, adding that such harassment also ""obstructs the public’s right to knowledge."" Fox explained that the NASA panel was created to help lay out a road map for using the tools of science to evaluate and categorize the nature of unidentified flying objects. The experts used unclassified data from civilian and government entities to inform the findings presented in the public meeting, she said. Fox added, however, that existing eyewitness reports are often murky and do not provide conclusive evidence for analysis. ""At NASA, we lead the world in exploration and are committed to rigorous scientific inquiry,"" she said. ""The nature of science is to better understand the unknown. And to do that, our scientists need data."" Kirkpatrick said future investigations would benefit from more instruments that could both detect unusual phenomena and trace their origins. The report set to be released this summer will likely outline more specific recommendations for such tools. Spergel, meanwhile, said he hopes the NASA panel's work will help reduce negative associations linked to the study of UFOs. Such attitudes likely mean that many sightings have gone unreported, particularly from commercial pilots, he said. ""One of our goals in having NASA play a role,"" he said, ""is to remove stigma and get high-quality data."" "
A verified AOC parody account got a boost from Elon Musk’s Twitter,Kat Tenbarge,"May 31, 2023, 9:26 PM UTC",Tech News,"A verified Twitter account mocking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has skyrocketed in followers and engagement over the last two days, with some help from Elon Musk. Twitter appeared to reinstate the once-banned account in May, with Musk soon interacting with it and boosting its following. Twitter has promoted the parody account in other ways, too, including ranking it first in search results for “AOC,” above Ocasio-Cortez’s official account. On Tuesday, the account garnered wide attention on the platform after the real Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, “FYI there’s a fake account on here impersonating me and going viral. The Twitter CEO has engaged it, boosting visibility. It is releasing false policy statements and gaining spread. I am assessing with my team how to move forward. In the meantime, be careful of what you see.” Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared to be referencing @AOCPress, which is marked as a parody account but looks close to identical to the congresswoman’s real account when users scroll through their feeds. Parody accounts are required to mark themselves as impersonators on their profiles, but that marking gets cut off when viewing the @AOCPress account’s tweets in the feeds of the mobile application. The account is fooling some of the people who read its tweets — bringing to life some of the fears about Musk’s paid verification system that stripped legacy verified users of their blue check marks. In the replies, there is a mix of responses from people taking the tweets at face value and attributing them to the real Ocasio-Cortez, while others point out that it’s a parody account. The account’s most viral tweet plays into a sexist trope that Musk and other conservatives have embraced since his Twitter takeover — that Ocasio-Cortez is secretly attracted to him. “This might be the wine talking, but I’ve got a crush on @elonmusk,” the parody account tweeted on May 28. The next day, Musk replied with a fire emoji. The tweet has been viewed more than 26 million times, according to Twitter’s metrics, and has more than 60,000 likes. Among other viral tweets Ocasio-Cortez may have been referencing is one that pledged $3 trillion in reparations to the transgender community and another that suggested sending 10 million Americans to Ukraine. The parody account actually has existed since November 2018 but the following year, under Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s leadership, it was permanently suspended for its “misleading” parody content. When Musk took over the company in 2022, the account was reinstated and some of the new policies have appeared to amplify it. According to Social Blade, a social media analytics tracker, the Ocasio-Cortez parody account had 85,000 followers in May 2019, the month it was suspended for impersonating the congresswoman. After the account’s restoration in May 2023, it immediately lost over 16,000 followers. Then, the account shot back up to over 80,000 followers on May 29, after Musk replied to it. On May 30, the day Ocasio-Cortez responded to the account, it gained over 100,000 followers. It has continued to climb, reaching over 292,000 followers as of publication. The @AOCPress account was first started by Michael Morrison, whose Twitter profile identifies him as a member of the New York Young Republicans Club. In May 2019, Morrison’s personal account and the parody account were both permanently suspended. Morrison posted about the suspensions on his account on the conservative social media platform Gab, where he also posted from a parody of Ocasio-Cortez’s official account between April 2019 and July 2019. The posts shared on Gab were more sexually explicit and the account reshared posts from other users that contained racist slurs. In November 2022, Morrison tweeted about his personal account being restored under Musk’s new leadership. The @AOCPress account wasn’t restored until May 2023. When reached for comment over Twitter direct messages, Morrison told NBC News he no longer runs the @AOCPress account and that it’s run by what he believes to be “a team of people.” The parody account didn’t respond to a request for comment. Another popular conservative tweeter, “@catturd2,” has played into rumors that he is behind the account, tweeting “I can’t confirm or deny that, but hey, you might want to follow” on May 22, the day the account was restored.

Oklahoma high court strikes down 2 abortion bans; procedure remains illegal in most cases,The Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 8:54 PM UTC",Politics News,"OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that two state laws banning abortion are unconstitutional, but the procedure remains illegal in the state in nearly all cases except life-threatening situations. In a 6-3 ruling, the high court said the two bans are unconstitutional because they require a “medical emergency” before a doctor can perform an abortion. The court said this language conflicts with a previous ruling it issued in March that determined the Oklahoma Constitution provides an “inherent right of a pregnant woman to terminate a pregnancy when necessary to preserve her life.” The court’s decision was welcomed by doctors who said uncertainty about the state’s abortion laws often forced them to make women facing severe medical complications and nonviable pregnancies to wait for their condition to worsen before they could perform an abortion. “In our practice we had cases where we would just have to tell women who we would normally offer a (pregnancy) termination to protect her health ... ‘We have to let you go home and monitor your condition and if you start showing signs of infection or worsening blood pressure, then come back and we have the ability to legally treat you,’” said Dana Stone, an Oklahoma City obstetrician and gynecologist. “Otherwise, we’re at risk with these laws of going to jail for 10 years, having hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and losing our medical licenses.” Despite the court’s March decision that the requirement to wait until an active medical emergency violated the state constitution, there remained uncertainty because of the two laws that remained in effect. “With their decision today, the court has ensured that the March decision will be fully realized,” said Rabia Muqaddam, a senior staff attorney at the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which challenged the laws on behalf of a Tulsa abortion provider. “Hopefully patients will be receiving the medically necessary care they need without waiting until they are on death’s door.” The laws struck down Wednesday both included a civil-enforcement mechanism that allowed citizens to sue someone who either performed or helped someone perform an abortion. “Despite the court’s decisions today on SB 1603 and HB 4327, Oklahoma’s 1910 law prohibiting abortion remains in place,” Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement. “Except for certain circumstances outlined in that statute, abortion is still unlawful in the state of Oklahoma.” Oklahoma’s 1910 law makes it a felony crime punishable by up to five years in prison for anyone to perform an abortion or help a woman obtain an abortion unless it is “necessary to preserve her life.” The court’s decision was decried by Republican leaders and Gov. Kevin Stitt, who have worked for years to tightly restrict abortion access in Oklahoma. “This court has once more over-involved itself in the state’s democratic process, and has interceded to undo legislation created by the will of the people,” Stitt said in a statement. “I agree with Justice (Dustin) Rowe’s dissent, ‘The issues presented in this matter are political questions, which are better resolved by the people via our democratic process.’” "
Connecticut lawmakers who tried to ban ‘Latinx’ now promote ‘Latine’,Edwin Flores,"May 25, 2023, 9:50 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 8:43 PM UTC",Latino,"Several Latino legislators in Connecticut who had proposed banning the term ""Latinx"" in state documents, calling it ""offensive"" and a ""woke term,"" are proposing the use of another gender-neutral word already being used in Spanish-speaking Latin America. The bill H.B.-6909 aims to approve the use of the terms “Latine” as well as “Latino” and “Latina” in state documents and official communications. The legislation wouldn't prohibit the use of “Latinx.” For a coalition of LGBTQ groups in the state, the recent proposal is a win. The lead co-sponsor of the new bill is state Rep. Geraldo Reyes, a Democrat, who previously led the legislation of the Latinx ban. That move came weeks after Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders banned the term in state documents on her first day in office. Reyes had said his motivations to ban Latinx differed from Sanders. He said Spanish language “defaults to Latino” for everyone regardless of gender, and argued that Latinx is not a Spanish word and was offensive to Connecticut’s Puerto Rican population. “In a perfect world, I think that we wouldn’t be using the word Latinx...Banning was not the right word but we just don’t want to use [Latinx] randomly to associate it with everybody,” Reyes said in an interview with NBC News. “There’s no punitive action. There’s nobody out there policing it. We’re just making this an awareness situation and we’ll see how it plays out for a year and then we’ll see if we have to do something else next year.” In legislative hearings, LGBTQ groups testified about the growing use of the gender-neutral ""Latine"" — spelled primarily in Latin American countries as Latiné — within the Latino and Spanish-speaking LGBTQ+ community. That was a selling point in the hearings, according to Nelson Rafael Feliciano Roman, founder and CEO of the Afro-Caribbean Cultural Center and coalition president of the Greater Waterbury PRIDE, a coalition of 15 LGTBQ+ community organizations. Roman said the revised bill, which is expected to receive support in the Senate, is a fair compromise. “The fact that we’ve gotten those six legislators that are just from a different generation to see the light and to acknowledge that the term Latine does come from our community, it is acceptable, it is inclusionary, I think is a victory for the LGBT community,” Roman, who testified in the bill's hearings, told NBC News. Roman self-identifies as Latine. He said he was once a major proponent of the term Latinx to describe his identity due to a lack of options within the binary Spanish language. Roman said Reyes and the other legislators shifted their stance after learning about Latine as a gender-neutral alternative. The term has been “picking up steam. It organically is coming from Central, South and the Caribbean of the Americas. And now it’s here in the U.S.,” he said. If the bill is passed in the state Senate, it would go into effect in October.

House Oversight chair prepares to hold FBI director in contempt over document in Biden probe,Ryan Nobles,"May 31, 2023, 3:35 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 8:16 PM UTC",Congress,"House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., said Tuesday the committee is moving forward with a vote to hold FBI Director Christopher Wray in criminal contempt of Congress for failing to hand over a document in the panel's investigation of the Biden family’s business dealings. Comer subpoenaed the FBI this month for an FD-1023 form that he and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, claim ""describes an alleged criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Biden and a foreign national relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions,” without providing further details. The FBI declined to provide the document, saying it is bound by Justice Department policy, which “strictly limits when and how confidential human source information can be provided outside of the FBI.” Wray spoke with Comer and Grassley by phone Wednesday, and after the call, the FBI said in a statement that Wray had offered to provide Comer ""an opportunity to review information responsive to the subpoena in a secure manner to accommodate the committee, while protecting the confidentiality and safety of sources."" ""The FBI remains committed to cooperating with the Committee in good faith,” the agency said. In a joint statement, Comer and Grassley said Wray confirmed the existence of the FD-1023 form during the call. But he “did not commit to producing the documents,” Comer said. “While Director Wray — after a month of refusing to even acknowledge that the form existed — has offered to allow us to see the documents in person at FBI headquarters, we have been clear that anything short of producing these documents to the House Oversight Committee is not in compliance with the subpoena,” Comer said. “If the FBI fails to hand over the FD-1023 form as required by the subpoena, the House Oversight Committee will begin contempt of Congress proceedings.” Comer last week threatened to hold Wray in contempt if the FBI didn't provide the information by Tuesday. In a statement Tuesday, he said the FBI informed the committee that “it will not provide the unclassified documents subpoenaed” by the panel. “The FBI’s decision to stiff-arm Congress and hide this information from the American people is obstructionist and unacceptable,” he said. The acting assistant director of the FBI, Christopher Dunham, sent a letter to Comer on Tuesday before his contempt threat. In the letter, which was obtained by NBC News, Dunham explains why the bureau can’t comply with the committee’s subpoena because of the need to protect human sources. “As we also have said previously, information provided by confidential human sources also implicates other longstanding Department confidentiality interest,” Dunham wrote. “The Department’s law enforcement and intelligence authorities enable us to collect significant amounts of information, but only subject to strict constitutional, statutory, and policy limits essential to the rule of law.” The letter also outlines how the FBI explained to Comer and his staff how FD-1023 forms were used and how agents vet them to ensure their accuracy. “Investigative reports, such as an FD-1023, include leads and suspicions, not the conclusions of investigators based on fuller context, including information that may not be available to the confidential source,” Dunham wrote. “As we have explained, an FD-1023 form documents information as told to a line FBI agent. Recording the information does not validate the information, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI. “Further, the public’s perception of the impartiality of the law enforcement process could be damaged if sensitive material is distributed beyond those necessary in the investigative process,” he added. An FBI spokesperson said in a statement that the bureau “remains committed to cooperating with the committee in good faith.” “In a letter to Chairman Comer earlier today, the FBI committed to providing access to information responsive to the Committee’s subpoena in a format and setting that maintains confidentiality and protects important security interests and the integrity of FBI investigations,” the FBI spokesperson said. “Last week, Director Wray scheduled a telephone call for tomorrow to provide additional details of the FBI’s extraordinary accommodation to satisfy the subpoena request. Any discussion of escalation under these circumstances is unnecessary.” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member on the Oversight Committee, asked to be a part of Comer’s call with Wray on Wednesday afternoon, but Comer denied his request. In a statement to NBC News, an Oversight Committee spokesperson argued Raskin’s inclusion on the call would not be productive. “This call is not another opportunity for Ranking Member Raskin to minimize whistleblower revelations and undermine the authorities of the very institution he represents,” the spokesperson said. Raskin then asked for his own call with Wray, and he said they spoke later Wednesday. “Director Wray informed me that the FBI has agreed to accommodate the Committee’s request by making the document sought by Chairman Comer available for in person review,"" Raskin said in a statement after the call. “It is increasingly clear that Committee Republicans have always planned to hold Director Wray in contempt of Congress to distract from the obvious fact that they do not have evidence to support their unfounded accusations against President Biden,"" Raskin said. ""This latest political maneuver underscores Chairman Comer’s determination to use the Committee to help former President Trump’s reelection efforts and pander to extreme MAGA Republicans."" Given that the Justice Department enforces any contempt citation, it’s unlikely that the department would pursue the committee’s plans to hold Wray in contempt. In an interview with “Fox and Friends” on Wednesday morning, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Comer was ready to move forward with a vote to hold Wray in contempt. McCarthy said he personally called Wray and told him he needs to comply with the subpoena. “If he misses the deadline today, I am prepared to move contempt charges in Congress against him,” McCarthy said. “We have jurisdiction over this. He can send us that document. “We have the right to look at that, Republicans and Democrats alike in that committee,” he added. “And if he does not follow through with the law, we will move contempt charges against Christopher Wray and the FBI.” "
"DeSantis plays up his personal side, hits back at Trump in campaign blitz across Iowa",The Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 6:57 PM UTC",2024 Election,"SALIX, Iowa — Ron DeSantis was making a four-stop blitz through Iowa during his first full day of presidential campaigning on Wednesday, aiming for a personal connection with voters while intensifying his criticism of former President Donald Trump. The Florida governor’s first stop was the floor of Port Neal Welding in Salix, a rural town near Sioux City, in the heart of the most Republican-heavy part of the state. Lining the highway outside the welding shop were metal structures including a towering Jesus, a version of the Statue of Liberty and the Minions. DeSantis talked up his efforts to push his state farther to the right. But he often barreled through his 30-minute speech in workmanlike fashion, left few pauses for applause from the audience of a bit more than 100 people, some wearing caps bearing seed company logos. Trying to position himself as the most formidable alternative to Trump in the crowded Republican White House primary field, DeSantis didn’t mention the former president by name in Salix. But he said the Bible emphasized the importance of being humble, adding that the country needed leaders who knew how to show humility. “The tired dogmas of the past are inadequate for a vibrant future. We have to look forward,” DeSantis said. “We can’t look backwards. We must have the courage to lead and we must have the strength to win.” He later sat with his wife, Casey, among hydraulic lifts and long welding tables arrayed with assorted metal engine parts. The pair took no questions but offered stories of their favorite drive-thru chicken restaurant and their kids — including an incident involving permanent marker drawings on the bathroom walls of the governor’s mansion. “They just seem very down to earth,” said Bev Lessman, a 70-year-old retired teacher from Sioux City. After speaking, DeSantis walked through the audience and Lessman wrapped her arms around DeSantis’ neck and told the governor she could feel what seemed to her to be the governor’s Christian devotion. “I told him we can’t make others live it, but I appreciated how he expressed his faith,” she said later. He replied, “But we can model it,” she said. “There was a connection,” Lessman added. Displaying a personal touch that resonates with voters is vital to succeeding in states like Iowa. That’s a departure from Florida and its large, expensive media markets where television advertising is often more important than on-the-ground campaigning given just how much ground there is to cover. DeSantis has subsequent Wednesday appearances in Council Bluffs, Pella and Cedar Rapids as he holds a string of early events in the state where caucuses kick off the Republican presidential primary voting. From there, he will head to New Hampshire on Thursday and South Carolina on Friday — two other states that vote early on the GOP primary calendar and where face-to-face interactions with voters are important. After months of speculation, DeSantis launched his campaign with a glitch-filled online kickoff last week and held his first official Iowa event Tuesday night before an energetic crowd of roughly 500 gathered inside a suburban Des Moines church. He didn’t mention Trump during his remarks, but speaking to reporters afterward, he pushed back against the former president in a way he had not before on the national stage. DeSantis accused Trump of essentially abandoning “America First” principles on immigration, supporting coronavirus pandemic-related lockdowns and generally having “moved left” on key issues. And DeSantis laughed off any criticism the former president had lobbed his way over his leadership in Florida, particularly on the state’s response to Covid-19. “Hell, his whole family moved to Florida under my governorship,” DeSantis said. “Are you kidding me?” The governor is opening his campaign looking up at Trump in the polls. He’s also for months been dogged by criticism that, while he’s comfortable on stage and in official settings, he can seem halting and awkward when interacting with regular Americans. Kate Romano, 60, of Indianola, Iowa, said she was more impressed by DeSantis than she expected during his Tuesday night appearance, calling him energetic and fun to hear. She voted reluctantly for Trump in 2016 and 2020, and she’s interested in hearing from other candidates. “I liked to hear that he’ll stand up to Trump,” Romano said. Kim Riesberg, 59, said she, too, voted twice for Trump but is not necessarily committed to him this time. DeSantis is a “little softer,” Riesberg, of Dallas Center, Iowa, said Tuesday night. And “more appealing to the masses.” Trump and his allies have unleashed a fresh round of anti-DeSantis attacks, sharing new polls finding the former president is the heavy favorite in the GOP race and taking aim at DeSantis’ leadership during the pandemic. A pro-Trump super PAC is also running ads on Iowa television accusing DeSantis of wanting to raise taxes, which the governor denies. The feud will have an opportunity to play in public as the week progresses. Trump, who was already scheduled to be in Iowa on Thursday, added stops in the state to his schedule for Wednesday, ensuring he would overlap with DeSantis for a time. Trump will tape a radio appearance in Des Moines before attending a GOP legislative dinner. DeSantis, meanwhile, will be back in Iowa on Saturday for an event for 2024 GOP hopefuls hosted by Sen. Joni Ernst. They will be joined by declared candidates including Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, along with former Vice President Mike Pence, who is expected to launch a campaign soon. All the travel will give DeSantis a lot of unscripted moments with voters — and he got a taste of that as he moved through the audience at the end of the Salix event. Some people approached the governor with specific points, as did Mark Choquette, who questioned DeSantis about his argument that it would take two terms for a president to reform the federal bureaucracy. “If he don’t bust ass and tear up D.C. in the first term, he may not get a second term and then where he be?” asked Choquette, a 76-year-old retired U.S. Marine and Vietnam War veteran. “That’s one reason I like Trump. He doesn’t have to worry about getting reelected.” "
Mike Pence is set to launch his presidential campaign next week,Jonathan Allen,"May 31, 2023, 6:30 PM UTC",2024 Election,"Mike Pence plans to enter the GOP presidential nomination fray June 7 with a campaign video and a kickoff speech in Des Moines, Iowa, according to a person familiar with his launch schedule. The former vice president, a longtime advocate of the priorities of traditional conservatives on social and economic issues, will join the race at a time when his onetime boss, former President Donald Trump, claims a majority in most national polls and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is in a clear second place. Redefining himself to Republican voters, most of whom know him primarily as Trump's vice president, will be a challenge. But the Indiana-bred Pence views his fellow Midwesterners in the Iowa GOP, and their first-in-the-nation caucuses, as a hospitable home for his brand of politics. Typically, the Iowa caucuses play a winnowing role in the nomination fight, providing rocket fuel to a handful of candidates while burying the hopes of the rest. ""We view this race as absolutely wide open, and Iowa is really going to solidify itself as the pivotal player,"" the person familiar with Pence's plans said. ""It's a place that values Mike Pence's principles — traditional conservative principles — deep-rooted faith and uncommon character."" The former vice president will campaign in all 99 Iowa counties before the caucuses, the person said, adding that the campaign ""will do the things that put Mike Pence in an advantageous position."" That includes a lot of retail politicking, from town hall-style meetings with Iowans to drop-by sessions at restaurants. In those sessions, he will have to explain to Republican voters why he split from Trump and certified their 2020 election loss on Jan. 6, 2021. A pro-Trump mob sacked the U.S. Capitol that day in an effort to stop the certification, and some of the rioters chanted ""hang Mike Pence.” As he weighed a campaign in recent months, Pence showed a willingness to separate himself from Trump on policy for the first time since becoming his running mate in 2016. In particular, Pence has unequivocally backed U.S. support for Ukraine and said that Congress and the White House should consider cuts to Medicare and Social Security — positions at odds with those articulated by Trump. Pence, who served a dozen years in the House and four years as Indiana's governor, has long been one of the Republican Party's most vocal leaders pushing the priorities of social conservatives on everything from abortion to LGBTQ rights. His record also shows a Reagan-era affinity for lower taxes, less regulation and robust defense spending. Despite their falling out, Pence's criticism of Trump has generally been indirect. The same goes for his approach to DeSantis, with whom he also disagrees on U.S. engagement in Ukraine. Still, the former vice president's entrance into the race injects someone who has been defined for many Americans — for better and worse — by his decision to stand up to Trump when the presidency and the rule of law were on the line. The field of contenders is growing more crowded by the week, with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum set to jump into the race in the coming days. That's a testament to Trump's failure to convince Republican rivals that he is invincible and DeSantis' inability to establish himself as Trump's  sole rival. For Pence, winning the nomination would represent a long and improbable path back to prominence. He'll take the first step in Des Moines next Wednesday, June 7, which is also his 64th birthday. ""What better place to do your announcement than a place that's going to be so pivotal in the future of the nation,"" the person familiar with his plans said. ""It certainly conveys the importance that we're placing on the state."" "
Nevada governor signs new abortion protections into law,Adam Edelman,"May 31, 2023, 4:52 PM UTC",Politics News,"Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo signed legislation late Tuesday that protects abortion rights for out-of-state patients seeking care in the state, as well as for providers within the state. In doing so, Lombardo became one of a handful of Republican governors to move to codify abortion rights — and the only swing-state GOP governor to do so in recent years. It could signal a degree of willingness within the party to moderate on an issue that has become a political liability following the Supreme Court’s decision last year striking down Roe v. Wade. That decision gave states wide latitude to set abortion policy. Abortion is already legal in Nevada under a voter referendum passed decades ago. The new bill signed by Lombardo effectively put into law an executive order signed last year by then-Gov. Steve Sisolak — the Democrat whom Lombardo narrowly defeated in November. That order banned Nevada officials and agencies from helping with investigations conducted by other states into their own residents who’d sought abortion care in Nevada. The bill also barred state medical boards, commissions and licensing committees from disciplining or disqualifying physicians in the state who provide abortion care. During the campaign, Lombardo often made contradictory statements about his stance on specific issues related to abortion. The Republican said that his “personal belief is pro-life” and that he would support a voter referendum changing state law to ban abortion after the 13th week of pregnancy. However, he also repeatedly acknowledged that abortion was legal under Nevada law until the 24th week of pregnancy. In addition, Lombardo said at one point during the campaign that he would repeal Sisolak’s executive order on abortion, only to reverse that position as well. Lombardo joins a small group of Republican governors — including Phil Scott of Vermont and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, who left office in January — who in recent years have enacted laws enshrining abortion protections in their states. His decision to sign the bill also highlights the challenges the Republican Party broadly faces regarding reproductive rights. Following the Supreme Court’s decision last summer to strike down federal abortion rights, Republicans have struggled on the issue. Polling shows that voters broadly favor abortion protections — which Democrats put at the center of their successful bid to keep the U.S. Senate and key governorships last year. While the party lost control of the House, it was by a significantly smaller margin than had been expected. The trend persisted into this year, when a liberal Wisconsin judge made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign for the state Supreme Court and won the seat by 11 percentage points in the crucial swing state. Meanwhile, many Republicans — including several running for president in 2024 — have pushed stricter abortion bans, or proposed bans. Back in Nevada, the state Republican Party tweeted last month, when the bill advanced through the Democratic-controlled state Senate with the support of two Republican legislators, that it was “horrified” that the bill passed with any GOP backing at all. A spokesperson for the Nevada Republican Party did not immediately respond to questions from NBC News regarding Lombardo’s decision to sign the bill. Lombardo’s decision drew plaudits from Democrats in the state, as well as state and national abortion rights groups — though many did not mention him by name. Others aimed their praise more directly at Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, a Democrat who sponsored the bill in the chamber. ""The vast majority of Nevadans and all Americans support abortion access and reproductive freedom. GOP politicians like Gov. Lombardo know this is true. Signing this legislation into law wasn’t just the right thing to do, it was the only thing to do to align with the will of Nevada voters,"" NARAL Pro-Choice America Southwest Regional Director Caroline Mello Roberson said in a statement to NBC News. “It’s official! Gov. Lombardo signed SB131 into law!” tweeted Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, the political arm in Nevada of the national reproductive rights group. The group added that it was “grateful” to Cannizzaro “and her fellow legislators” for “leading the effort to protect Nevada’s abortion providers and out-of-state patients.” Cannizzaro, for her part, praised Lombardo in a tweet, writing, “I want thank him for following through on his commitment to ensure that Nevada won’t participate in prosecutions of women who come here to exercise their reproductive rights.” "
Republican Rep. Chris Stewart plans to leave Congress,Rebecca Shabad,"May 31, 2023, 4:33 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, announced Wednesday that he plans to step down from Congress before his term ends because of his wife's health. Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the House, and a brief vacancy could make passing legislation more difficult for GOP leadership. Republicans have 222 members in the House; Democrats have 213. Stewart said in a statement that he would resign after ""an orderly transition can be ensured."" “It has been one of the great honors of my life to serve the good people of Utah in Congress,” he said. ""My wife and I have made so many dear friends and memories throughout our journey. I can say with pride that I have been an effective leader for my beloved home state, and I’m honored to have played an important role in guiding our nation through some troubled times. But my wife’s health concerns have made it necessary that I retire from Congress after an orderly transition can be ensured."" He added: ""My family and I have been very blessed by this experience. Thank you to all those who have supported and sacrificed to help us. The fight goes on. God bless all of you, and God bless our nation."" Stewart did not specify what is wrong with his wife's health. Stewart, 62, has been in the House since 2013, representing Utah's 2nd Congressional District. He is on the Intelligence and Appropriations committees. Utah law requires Gov. Spencer Cox to call a special election for the seat, which represents the western part of the state, including Salt Lake City. Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson posted a thread on Twitter on Tuesday explaining the process. The seat will almost certainly stay in Republican hands. Utah is a deeply conservative state, and the congressional delegation is entirely Republican. Stewart beat his Democratic challenger last year by nearly 26 percentage points. "
Former N.J. Gov. Chris Christie to announce his 2024 presidential bid Tuesday,Vaughn Hillyard,"May 31, 2023, 12:50 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 2:22 PM UTC",2024 Election,"Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is set to announce his 2024 presidential campaign Tuesday at a town hall in Manchester, New Hampshire, two sources confirmed. It is the second shot at the Republican presidential nomination for Christie, who stumbled to a sixth-place finish in the 2016 New Hampshire primary. Axios was the first to report the timing of Christie's announcement. After he dropped out of the race eight years ago, Christie, in a then-stunning move, endorsed Donald Trump just days before Super Tuesday, lending a credible name to Trump’s momentum. Christie and Trump became allies, with Christie heading up Trump's presidential transition team and later preparing him for debates against Joe Biden in 2020. But Christie has emerged as a vocal critic of Trump, who remains the Republican front-runner in the polls, after Trump refused to concede his loss to Biden in 2020 and pushed baseless claims of widespread election fraud. Christie has continued to criticize Trump, especially in his role as a political contributor on ABC News. In a segment on “This Week” this month, Christie argued GOP candidates can't beat Trump by ""cozying up to him."" Christie has held several town hall meetings in New Hampshire, a swing state, in the past few months. In a town hall in Manchester in March, Christie took a voter’s question about why he failed to take on Trump in 2016. In response, Christie said he and the rest of the field made a “strategic error” in underestimating Trump, whose lack of policy knowledge was apparent, and believed each of them had a chance to winnow the field into a potential one-on-one match up with him, but ""none of us ever got there."" Christie also defended his endorsement of Trump in 2016, saying he made the calculation at the time that Trump would be better than Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida were still in the GOP presidential primary when Christie endorsed Trump). Christie said he believed he’d be able to effectively shape Trump as a better candidate and president but was proved wrong. In another town hall meeting in New Hampshire in April, Christie devoted his entire opening remarks to slamming Trump. “Tonight is the beginning of the case against Donald Trump,” Christie said. “You’re not going to beat someone by closing your eyes, clicking your heels together three times and saying, ‘There’s no place like home.’ That’s not going to work. “Donald Trump is a TV star, nothing more, nothing less,” he added. “Let me suggest to you that in putting him back in the White House, the reruns will be worse than the original show.” Christie served two terms as New Jersey governor from 2010 to 2018. His tenure came under scrutiny during the so-called Bridgegate case, a political scandal in 2013 involving lane closures at the George Washington Bridge, allegedly in retaliation against a Democratic mayor who refused to endorse his re-election. Before he was elected governor, Christie was the U.S. attorney for New Jersey from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush. Christie is set to challenge Trump, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, conservative talk radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson for the 2024 GOP nomination. Former Vice President Mike Pence is also expected to announce a potential bid in the coming weeks. A poll by Monmouth University this week found that Christie’s favorability rating among Republicans is quite poor. Just 21% of registered voters who identify with or lean toward the GOP have a favorable view of him, while 47% view him unfavorably, 24% say they have no opinion of him, and 8% say they haven’t heard enough about him. Christie’s results in the poll, the worst among the potential Republican presidential candidates tested, pale in comparison to the ratings of Trump and DeSantis, whose favorability numbers were both above 70%.

Nevada becomes latest to enhance penalties for election worker intimidation after statewide exodus,Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 11:59 AM UTC",Elections,"CARSON CITY, Nev. — Those who harass, intimidate or use force on election workers performing their duties in Nevada could soon face up to four years in prison under a new law signed by the Western swing state’s Republican governor on Tuesday. The law is meant to deter attacks against those in state and local election offices who have faced increased scrutiny for doing their jobs, Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said Tuesday. Threats and intimidation of election workers had ramped up significantly in Nevada and across the country amid falsehoods and conspiracy theories about foul play denying former President Donald Trump victory in the 2020 presidential race. Other states have taken similar steps to better protect election officials in recent years, including Maine, Vermont, Washington, New Mexico and Oklahoma. The bill, passed unanimously through both chambers of Nevada’s Democratic-controlled Legislature, was a core campaign promise from Aguilar, who cited an exodus of election workers across the state due in part to increased threats. The law also makes it a felony to disseminate personal information about an election worker without their consent. “I want election workers to know that the secretary of state’s office has their back,” Aguilar said at the ceremony. Aguilar stood alongside Republican Gov. Lombardo at the bill signing ceremony — a pair that have recently sparred over Lombardo’s proposal to require voter ID, to which Aguilar has opposed and legislative Democrats have described as a non-starter since the beginning of session. Over half of the top election officials across Nevada’s 17 counties stepped down between the 2020 election and 2022 midterms, with several citing election threats. Many of their staff members had resigned too, along with an exodus of workers in the secretary of state’s election department leading up to the 2022 midterms. That was due both to election burnout and better opportunities elsewhere, the office said at the time. Aguilar’s campaign vow to protect election workers and restore trust in elections became a foil to his opponent, Republican Jim Marchant, who led a nationwide coalition of secretary of state candidates seeking to discredit the electoral process. Several election deniers were defeated in Nevada statewide elections despite the split-ticket outcome. Lombardo was endorsed by former President Donald Trump but pushed back against his false claims of a stolen 2020 election, saying there was a “modicum” of fraud but not enough to sway an election. Another bill that recently made it to Lombardo’s desk would criminalize so-called “fake electors,” or anybody who signed certificates falsely stating when a candidate wins a certain state to the National Archives — as six Nevada GOP members did in 2020. Spokeswoman Elizabeth Ray said the governor’s office declined to take a specific stance on that legislation, which includes a higher-level felony for the fake electors than the bill signed Tuesday. Aguilar’s bill became particularly timely after a federal court acquitted a Las Vegas man of charges from threatening calls he made to the Nevada Secretary of State’s office the morning after the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capital. The indictment alleged that Gjergi Luke Juncaj accused a woman who answered his calls of “stealing the election” and treason; said he hoped her children were molested; and said those working in her office were “all going to die.” “I can tell you, it has put a chilling effect in our office as of today,” Aguilar said at a bill hearing the day after the court ruling. “Because people are afraid … They are struggling just knowing that something like this can continue to happen. And that is why this law is so needed.” Had the state law been in place at the time of the threats, “(Juncaj) would not be a free man today,” Aguilar said on Tuesday, The penalty would be one to four years in state prison with the possibility of probation — the same as it is to harass, intimidate or use force on voters. The bill was amended before a state Senate vote to prohibit all state officers — including the governor, secretary of state and legislators — from campaign fundraising during the legislative session, which runs every other year from February to early June.

NASA panel to hold first public meeting on UFO study ahead of report,Reuters,"May 31, 2023, 11:53 AM UTC",Politics News,"WASHINGTON — A NASA panel formed last year to study what the government calls “unidentified aerial phenomena,” commonly termed UFOs, was due to hold its first public meeting on Wednesday, ahead of a report expected in coming weeks. The 16-member body, assembling experts from fields ranging from physics to astrobiology, was formed last June to examine unclassified UFO sightings and other data collected from civilian government and commercial sectors. The focus of Wednesday’s four-hour public session “is to hold final deliberations before the agency’s independent study team publishes a report this summer,” NASA said in announcing the meeting. The panel represents the first such inquiry ever conducted under the auspices of the U.S. space agency for a subject the government once consigned to the exclusive and secretive purview of military and national security officials. The NASA study is separate from a newly formalized Pentagon-based investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, documented in recent years by military aviators and analyzed by U.S. defense and intelligence officials. The parallel NASA and Pentagon efforts — both undertaken with some semblance of public scrutiny — highlight a turning point for the government after decades spent deflecting, debunking and discrediting sightings of unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, dating back to the 1940s. The term UFOs, long associated with notions of flying saucers and aliens, has been replaced in government parlance by “UAP.” While NASA’s science mission was seen by some as promising a more open-minded approach to a topic long treated as taboo by the defense establishment, the U.S. space agency made it known from the start that it was hardly leaping to any conclusions. “There is no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin,” NASA said in announcing the panel’s formation last June. In its more recent statements, the agency presented a new potential wrinkle to the UAP acronym itself, referring to it as an abbreviation for “unidentified anomalous phenomena.” This suggested that sightings other than those that appeared airborne may be included. Still, NASA in announcing Wednesday’s meeting, said the space agency defines UAPs “as observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena from a scientific perspective.” U.S. defense officials have said the Pentagon’s recent push to investigate such sightings has led to hundreds of new reports that are under examination, though most remain categorized as unexplained. The head of the Pentagon’s newly formed All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has said the existence of intelligent alien life has not been ruled out but that no sighting had produced evidence of extraterrestrial origins.

Jan. 6 rioter who wanted Pelosi brought out to mob is sentenced to 2 years,Phil Helsel,"May 31, 2023, 1:46 AM UTC",U.S. news,"A Pennsylvania woman who went into the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot and demanded that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi be brought out to the mob was sentenced to more than two years in prison Tuesday, officials said. Pauline Bauer, 55, was recorded shouting “bring her out here” and “we’re coming in if you don’t bring her out here” near the House speaker’s office during the 2021 attack, according to court documents. Bauer was sentenced to 27 months in prison, or two years and three months, the U.S. attorney’s office for Washington, D.C., said in a statement. She was convicted at a bench trial — meaning before a judge rather than a jury — in January on charges of obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building and other counts. An attorney listed as representing her did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors said Bauer was part of a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress was formally counting the electoral votes affirming Trump’s loss. Trump and his supporters had spread lies about the 2020 election, and Trump falsely said that then-Vice President Mike Pence could halt the proceedings. Pence refused, saying he had no authority to do so. Bauer had also pushed a Washington police officer during a confrontation and was physically removed from the area by officers in riot gear, the U.S. attorney's office said. Bauer’s attorney argued for a period of supervision without additional imprisonment, writing in a sentencing memorandum that she regrets and takes responsibility for her actions and poses no threat to society. Prosecutors sought 78 months in prison, or 6½ years, according to the government’s sentencing memo. They argued that Bauer threatened to kill Pelosi of California, the Democratic House speaker at the time, yelling “They’re criminals. They need to hang,” and threatening to hang Pelosi by name. In addition to the prison time, Bauer was sentenced to 24 months' supervised release and a $2,000 fine, the U.S. attorney's office said. "
Biden-McCarthy debt ceiling deal approved by key committee ahead of House vote,Sahil Kapur,"May 30, 2023, 12:55 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 12:54 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — A major debt ceiling bill negotiated by President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy passed its first test Tuesday, gaining approval from the Republican-led House Rules Committee and setting up a vote Wednesday in the full chamber. The vote was 7 to 6, with two Republicans — Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas — and all four Democrats voting no. It sends the bill to the House floor. The 99-page Fiscal Responsibility Act, which faces heavy criticism from some GOP hard-liners, will need a majority of the House to pass. It is sure to rely on some Democratic votes in the narrowly divided chamber. If the bill is passed by the House, it would then need to be approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate before the Treasury Department’s deadline of Monday to avert a calamitous default. Follow along for live updates Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., one of three ultraconservatives on the Rules Committee, announced earlier that he planned to vote yes, which all but assured passage through the panel. “There are things to dislike and things to like about this bill,” Massie said. “When people want to express their ideology, the floor of the House on the actual final passage of the bill is the place to do that.” Norman described the bill as ""smoke and mirrors,"" arguing that Republicans “should have walked away” from the table after they passed their party-line debt limit legislation and forced Democrats to either swallow it or accept default.

Alabama expands ban on trans athletes to include college teams,Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 10:17 PM UTC",OUT Politics and Policy,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Tuesday signed legislation that will ban transgender women from playing on female sports teams in college, becoming the latest state to place restrictions on transgender athletes. The legislation expands the state’s existing 2021 ban on transgender athletes on K-12 sports teams to include college teams. Students assigned one sex at birth would be prohibited from playing under a different gender identity, even after undergoing hormone treatment. “Look, if you are a biological male, you are not going to be competing in women’s and girls’ sports in Alabama. It’s about fairness, plain and simple,” Ivey said in a statement. The bill is part of a wave of restrictions on transgender people being pushed in conservative states. At least 20 states have now imposed restrictions on transgender athletes at the K-12 or collegiate level, or both. While supporters say transgender women have an unfair advantage in competition, opponents say the bills are about shaming transgender people and are rooted in discrimination and politics. Carmarion D. Anderson-Harvey, Alabama state director of the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for LGBTQ people, said the legislation is part of a “systematic attack against LGBTQ+ people” in Alabama and elsewhere. “In just two years, she and extremist lawmakers in Alabama have passed four anti-LGBTQ+ bills. From dictating what bathrooms we can use to blatantly ignoring the actual problems in women’s sports, these politicians are making Alabama an increasingly hostile place for transgender people and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole,” Anderson-Harvey said. Alabama lawmakers approved bills restricting bathroom and locker room usage and a ban on the use of gender-affirming hormones and puberty blockers to treat transgender minors. A judge has temporarily blocked the medication ban from taking effect while a court challenge goes forward. The latest sports bill was approved with lopsided support in both chambers, passing 26-4 in the Alabama Senate and 83-5 in the House of Representatives. More than a dozen House members abstained from the vote. "
"Far-right members, unhappy with debt deal, float threatening McCarthy's speakership",Katherine Doyle,"May 30, 2023, 2:52 PM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 9:27 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — As criticism builds in Republican ranks over the debt ceiling deal struck by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and President Joe Biden, some hard-line conservatives have begun floating the idea of toppling the speaker. On a House Freedom Caucus call Monday night, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., floated using the motion to vacate, a rule that would allow any House member to force a vote to remove the speaker, two sources familiar with the call said. Buck, speaking toward the end of the call, referred to it as the “elephant in the room,” a source said. After House Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, R-Pa., suggested it might be too early for such a drastic threat, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., proposed using the threat to force McCarthy to allow members to amend the bill on the House floor, under an ""open rule"" that could stall the bill's passage. Perry responded that the issue would be discussed more when members return to Washington after the long weekend. A lawmaker on the call who confirmed that Buck brought up using the motion to vacate said of the Biden-McCarthy deal, “Some people feel this is a complete miss,” adding, “I’d say there are five or more who would be sympathetic to Buck’s position.” Follow along for live updates Another lawmaker who was on the call but didn’t hear Buck's suggestion said bluntly, “The unity we had is gone.” In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press NOW"" after he returned to Washington on Tuesday afternoon, Buck said that ""yes,"" he had raised the question of whether Freedom Caucus members were considering a motion to vacate, but he said he wasn’t calling for McCarthy’s ouster. “I was asking my colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus whether they were considering a motion to vacate as a result of a broken promise,” Buck said. “Scott Perry, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told me it’s premature: ‘Let’s get through this battle and decide if we want another battle.’” Nearly a dozen Freedom Caucus members slammed the debt ceiling bill at a news conference Tuesday and vowed to vote no, but when they were asked how many of their members would support a motion to vacate, only Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., raised his hand. Asked Tuesday afternoon whether he was worried about Bishop’s threatening a motion to oust him, McCarthy replied: “No. That’s his choice.” While right-wing members have blasted the deal publicly — calling it ""insanity"" and a ""turd-sandwich"" and criticizing the scale of the cuts — lawmakers had held back from threatening to oust McCarthy over the agreement. Over the weekend, many lawmakers dismissed using a motion to vacate when they were asked whether they would threaten McCarthy’s speakership over the debt bill, even as growing numbers say they intend to vote against it. But as a former Republican White House official said over the weekend after the deal was announced: “McCarthy is now on a clock.” A spokesperson for Buck declined to comment on the remarks but said he is looking to yield a solution to the debt ceiling “that doesn’t give Democrats a blank check.” “We don’t comment on internal HFC discussions,” Buck spokesperson Joe Jackson said. “Congressman Buck is focused on finding a debt ceiling solution that doesn’t give Democrats a blank check to add trillions of dollars to the debt in the next two years.” Spokespeople for Perry and Gosar didn’t respond to requests for comment. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, warned at Tuesday’s news conference of a “reckoning” for Republican leaders “unless we stop this bill by tomorrow.” “The Republican conference right now has been torn asunder,” Roy said, urging that ""not one Republican"" vote for the bill. Asked how many members would support the motion to vacate, Perry said he was “focused on defeating this bill,” declining repeatedly to discuss the issue. “What happens post that and the agreements that we have we will decide once we’ve determined the disposition of this bill and its finality,” Perry said. After the news conference, Bishop, who called the vote “career-defining” for House Republicans, wouldn’t say whether he himself would file the motion to oust McCarthy but said: ""It has to be done. ""I'm ready to go figure out how to fix this s--- sandwich. This can still be fixed, but the road gets narrower to fixing it every time,"" Bishop said. ""And Kevin McCarthy's been sitting there in leadership."" "
What the debt ceiling deal would mean for student loan payments and forgiveness,Erik Ortiz,"May 30, 2023, 9:08 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"Federal student loan borrowers are facing a reckoning as a result of the tentative debt ceiling deal struck in Washington. If the agreement between the Biden administration and top congressional Republicans is signed into law, payments on federal student loans that were paused at the start of the pandemic will be reinstated at the end of August, with those bills coming due the following month. That means some 43 million borrowers like Daniel Galván, a 34-year-old from Southern California, must start tightening their household budgets amid higher food costs and other unforeseen expenses. Galván, a university administrator who still owes about $10,500 on his student loans, said payments may have stopped over the last three years, but his financial obligations only grew. Follow along for live updates ""The pause was helpful,"" he said Tuesday. ""My wife and I could buy a house in 2020. The money that would have gone to a loan payment helped me save up for that house and our initial expenses. Now, we have 1-year-old twins, and they are not cheap."" In March 2020, then-President Donald Trump signed the CARES Act, which allowed federal student loan holders to forgo payments without being penalized. President Joe Biden extended the pause as concerns about inflation and rising gas prices continued to sap consumers. Interest on federal student loans was also suspended to the benefit of borrowers. The moratorium, however, did not apply to borrowers with privately held loans. Natalia Abrams, a founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Los Angeles, criticized the White House for allowing student loan relief to be clawed back, particularly while the Biden administration's larger plan to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt remains in limbo in the Supreme Court. ""Borrowers got sold out,"" Abrams said. ""They feel thrown under the bus with these negotiations."" Her concern, she said, is the potential for millions of people getting socked with bills that they didn't realize are due and can't afford. That would be true for borrowers who graduated in 2020 and have not had to factor in loan payments these past three years, she said. ""It really seems that could punish young folks,"" added Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a member of the House progressive caucus. ""And it would be in my view politically disastrous to force millions of young folks to start paying their student loans when Trump had forgiven them, more or less.” Republicans have been staunchly against continuing the student loan pause, which House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said has cost taxpayers about $5 billion each month. ""What the president did, he went unconstitutionally and said he was going to waive certain people part of their debt for student loan(s), but then he paused everybody's student loan,"" McCarthy said of Biden on ""Fox News Sunday."" He added: ""So everybody who borrowed a student loan within 60 days of the signing is going to have to pay that back."" Cody Hounanian, the executive director of the Student Debt Crisis Center, said he's worried that the Education Department is not positioned to take on the ""monumental task"" of informing student borrowers that they must pay back their loans. He added that student loan servicers, some of which have been accused of predatory lending and deceptive practices, can't be trusted to have borrowers' best interests in mind. ""The lives of 40 million people are going to be disrupted, while at the end of the day, the cost is a drop in the bucket for the federal government,"" Hounanian said. ""On the other side, it's going to be incredibly harmful to a lot of people's lives."" But Education Secretary Miguel Cardona has said his agency is ready to deal with the fallout after warning this spring that student loans could eventually come due as the Supreme Court weighed litigation related to student debt relief. In a tweet Sunday, Cardona pledged a ""smooth return to the repayment process,"" while assuring that the debt ceiling deal ""protects our ability to pause student loan payments"" during future emergencies. Biden's overall plan to forgive federal student debt is estimated to cost over $400 billion. The administration has proposed discharging up to $10,000 in debt for those earning less than $125,000 a year or couples who file taxes jointly and earn less than $250,000 annually. Pell Grant recipients, who are the majority of borrowers, would be eligible for an additional $10,000 in debt relief. Some 20 million people could have all of their remaining student loan debt erased under the plan. But six Republican-led states — Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina — have started litigation accusing the federal government of exceeding its authority in trying to forgive student debt. Legal experts say the states may feel emboldened, given the high court's 6-3 conservative-leaning majority. During oral arguments in February, the conservative justices appeared skeptical of the administration's plan, fueling concern among student advocacy groups and Democrats that Biden's goal to provide student debt relief — which could haunt him as he looks to re-election in 2024 — may be thwarted. A decision by the Supreme Court is expected before the end of June. "
Debt ceiling deal details: What does the Biden-McCarthy bill include?,Sahil Kapur,"May 29, 2023, 5:34 PM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 6:09 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — The bipartisan deal struck by Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy would extend the debt limit for two years alongside modest federal spending cuts and a series of policy provisions. The 99-page Fiscal Responsibility Act, which McCarthy, R-Calif., says will get a vote in the Republican-led House on Wednesday, will need to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate before the June 5 deadline set by the Treasury Department to act or risk default. Here's what is in the legislation: Follow along for live updates The core of the deal is a suspension of the debt ceiling — currently at $31.4 trillion — until Jan. 1, 2025. The Treasury Department could then use ""extraordinary measures"" to pay the bills, which typically last for months. That effectively resolves the issue through the 2024 election, leaving it to the next president and the new Congress to deal with. The agreement includes spending caps for the next two years to set up the appropriations process. In fiscal year 2024, it would limit military spending to $886 billion and nonmilitary discretionary spending to $704 billion. In fiscal year 2025, those numbers would rise to about $895 billion and $711 billion. McCarthy said the deal was ""historic,"" as it would amount to ""cutting spending year-over-year for the first time in over a decade."" Factoring in adjustments, the White House projects that when veterans funding is set aside, nondefense spending would barely change — with a slight reduction overall from 2023 to 2024. ""It's flat. It's a difference of about $1 billion,"" a White House official said. ""In a divided government, we're not going to get the kinds of [nondefense discretionary] increases that we would hope to get."" What do House Republicans get? The bill would rescind about $28 billion in unspent Covid relief funds. It would eliminate $1.4 billion in IRS funding and shift about $20 billion of the $80 billion provided to the agency through the Inflation Reduction Act to non-defense funds. It would restart federal student loan payments after a lengthy ""pause"" that began at the start of the pandemic. It would also slap work requirements for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits on people up to 55 years old (the current threshold is 50), with carve-outs for veterans and homeless people. The bill would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act to streamline permitting for projects; House Republicans tout it as ""the first significant reforms to NEPA since 1982."" The White House is touting it as a budget deal — not a ransom payment for a debt ceiling extension — and emphasizing the modesty of the spending cuts even though it faces a GOP-led House. It also notes that the bill would make ""no changes to Medicaid"" and leave Social Security and Medicare untouched. The White House says the bill would fully preserve the climate and clean energy provisions of last year's Inflation Reduction Act and leave Biden's executive action on student debt forgiveness untouched. And it would avert a catastrophic default for the rest of Biden's first term. ""We think that taking the threat of default off the table into 2025 is a significant upside for the economy, a significant accomplishment,"" the White House official said. "
Former first lady Rosalynn Carter is diagnosed with dementia,Dareh Gregorian,"May 30, 2023, 5:21 PM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 5:45 PM UTC",Politics News,"Former first lady Rosalynn Carter has dementia, the Carter family said Tuesday. The announcement, which was released by the Carter Center, comes as Carter's husband, former President Jimmy Carter, is receiving hospice care at their home in Plains, Georgia. The center said in a statement that Rosalynn Carter, 95, ""continues to live happily at home with her husband, enjoying spring in Plains and visits with loved ones."" ""Mrs. Carter has been the nation’s leading mental health advocate for much of her life"" and has ""improved access to care and decreased stigma about issues surrounding mental health."" The statement noted that, ""One in 10 older Americans have dementia, a condition that affects overall mental health. We recognize, as she did more than half a century ago, that stigma is often a barrier that keeps individuals and their families from seeking and getting much-needed support. We hope sharing our family’s news will increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor’s offices around the country."" The statement did not say when she was diagnosed or give any more details on her condition. It noted her work supporting caregivers through her nonprofit organization. ""As the founder of the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers, Mrs. Carter often noted that there are only four kinds of people in this world: those who have been caregivers; those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers,"" the statement said. ""The universality of caregiving is clear in our family, and we are experiencing the joy and the challenges of this journey."" ""We do not expect to comment further and ask for understanding for our family and for everyone across the country serving in a caregiver role."" In February, the Carter Center announced that Jimmy Carter, 98, had begun receiving hospice care at home. “After a series of short hospital stays, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter today decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention,” the center had said. The couple's grandson Jason Carter said last week that his grandparents have “been together 70-plus years. They also know that they’re not in charge.” “Their faith is really grounding in this moment. In that way, it’s as good as it can be,” he said. Jimmy Carter is the oldest living former president and was the first president born in a hospital. "
Russia issues arrest warrant for Lindsey Graham after Ukraine comments,The Associated Press,"May 29, 2023, 2:20 PM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 12:34 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"MOSCOW — Russia’s Interior Ministry on Monday issued an arrest warrant for Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., following his comments related to the fighting in Ukraine. In an edited video of his meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that was released by Zelenskyy’s office, Graham said “the Russians are dying” and described the U.S. military assistance to the country as “the best money we’ve ever spent.” While Graham appeared to have made the remarks in different parts of the conversation, the short video by Ukraine’s presidential office put them next to each other, causing outrage in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented Sunday by saying that “it’s hard to imagine a greater shame for the country than having such senators.”” The Investigative Committee, the country’s top criminal investigation agency, has moved to open a criminal inquiry against Graham, and the Interior Ministry followed up by issuing a warrant for his arrest as indicated Monday by its official record of wanted criminal suspects. Graham is among more than 200 U.S. members of Congress whom Moscow banned last year from entering Russia. Graham commented on Twitter, saying that “to know that my commitment to Ukraine has drawn the ire of Putin’s regime brings me immense joy.” “I will continue to stand with and for Ukraine’s freedom until every Russian soldier is expelled from Ukrainian territory,” he tweeted. “I will wear the arrest warrant issued by Putin’s corrupt and immoral government as a Badge of Honor.” "
China rejects U.S. request for a meeting of the defense chiefs,Jennifer Jett,"May 30, 2023, 9:59 AM UTC",World,"HONG KONG — China has declined a request from the U.S. for a meeting between the countries’ defense chiefs, the Defense Department said late Monday as the world’s two largest economies struggle to mend ties. The Pentagon had suggested a meeting between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security forum being held in Singapore from Friday to Sunday. Washington has been seeking to restore high-level communications with Beijing as both sides signal a willingness to ease tensions stoked by clashes over Taiwan, a Chinese spy balloon and Russia’s war in Ukraine. But China has outlined limits to that conciliation over its issues with U.S. sanctions and what it sees as a broader effort to contain its rise. “Overnight, the PRC informed the U.S. that they have declined our early May invitation,” the Pentagon said in a statement, using an abbreviation for China’s formal name, the People’s Republic of China. “The Department believes strongly in the importance of maintaining open lines of military-to-military communication between Washington and Beijing to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict.” Responding Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reiterated Beijing’s opposition to the U.S. sanctions Li has been under since 2018. “If the United States says it wants to communicate while suppressing and containing China by any means and imposing sanctions on Chinese officials, institutions and enterprises, what is the sincerity and meaning of such communication?” she said at a regular news briefing in Beijing. Li, an aerospace engineer and general in the People’s Liberation Army, the military wing of the ruling Communist Party, was named defense minister in March. He had been sanctioned by the Trump administration over his role in the acquisition of weapons from Russia as part of China’s military modernization drive. The Pentagon says the sanctions on Li do not prevent Austin from meeting with him. “It’s designed to be a snub, I think that’s pretty evident,” Alexander Neill, a Singapore-based strategic adviser on Asia-Pacific geopolitics, told NBC News. This is not the first time China has rejected the Pentagon’s overtures, according to a senior U.S. defense official, who said that since 2021, Beijing has declined or failed to respond to more than a dozen requests for meetings at multiple levels. “Frankly, it’s just the latest in a litany of excuses,” the official said. President Joe Biden indicated at a summit of major industrial nations in Japan this month that the sanctions on Li might be lifted, but a State Department spokesperson later said that was not under consideration. Though China’s armed forces are commanded by the Central Military Commission and not by Li, whose role is largely ceremonial, he serves as a key point of contact for foreign militaries. U.S.-China relations have been strained since Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a trip to Beijing in February after a Chinese surveillance balloon was shot down over U.S. territory by the military. That trip has yet to be rescheduled. China has also objected to U.S. accusations that it is considering providing Russia with lethal military assistance in its war against Ukraine, as well as two stopovers in the U.S. by the president of Taiwan, a self-ruling island that Beijing claims as its territory. Biden, who last spoke with President Xi Jinping at a meeting in Indonesia in November, said at the G7 summit that he expected a “thaw very soon” in the U.S.-China relationship. There have been encouraging signs since then, including the arrival last week of China’s new ambassador, Xie Feng, after months of delay. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo met with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Wentao, in Washington last week, the first Cabinet-level exchange between the two countries in months. That followed a meeting in Vienna between national security adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, and a meeting in Beijing between U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. But relations between the two militaries are “obviously the most fraught and sensitive within the bilateral relationship,” Neill said. U.S. officials say the breakdown in communication raises the risk of an unintended crisis or conflict between the two countries, whose militaries are both active in the Asia-Pacific region. The Shangri-La Dialogue is known as a forum for defense officials to network informally, and Austin met Li’s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, at the same event last year. Though China has rebuffed the idea of a side meeting this year, Austin and Li could still cross paths. “There’s a possibility that they will have a brush-past and a handshake and a photo opportunity,” Neill said. “I think it’ll look pretty grim if they don’t do that, in fact.” But he said military communications between the two countries are unlikely to improve unless Xi “is willing to sit down and talk with the U.S. president about his concerns.” “If that’s not going to happen,” Neill said, “then there won’t be a sort of cascade of similar engagements with the PLA.” Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong and Courtney Kube from Washington.

The stark numbers driving Democratic panic about a third-party 2024 bid,Mark Murray,"May 30, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",2024 Election,"Among all the reasons Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in 2020 but Hillary Clinton didn’t four years earlier, one looms especially large for the coming presidential election: the share of the third-party vote. In 2016, 6% of all voters cast ballots for third-party and write-in candidates, with Libertarian Gary Johnson getting more than 3% of the national vote and Green Party nominee Jill Stein capturing more than 1%. But in 2020, that proportion fell to 2%. The difference effectively changed the threshold the major candidates needed to reach to win key battleground states — from 47% and 48% in 2016 to 49% and 50% in 2020. That, Democrats say, made it easier for Trump to win in ’16 but not in ’20. And the numbers illustrate why Democratic groups — eyeing a possible, if not likely, rematch between Biden and Trump — want to keep the third-party vote share as small as possible, including moving to keep the well-financed third-party group No Labels off the ballot in battleground states. Comparing the results from 2016 and 2020, what stands out is that Trump’s vote share (nationally, in key battleground states and in key counties) stayed virtually the same — even as he won one election and lost another. What changed is that Biden grew the Democratic Party vote share by 2 to 3 points across the board, while the protest vote for other candidates dropped. Take battleground Pennsylvania, for example: Trump defeated Clinton in the state in 2016, 48.2% to 47.5%. But as the third-party vote declined in 2020, Biden won it, 49.9% to 48.7%. The same situation played out in Wisconsin. Trump captured the battleground state in 2016, 47.2% to 46.5%. But in 2020, it was Biden 49.5%, Trump 48.8%. Another way to look at the third-party effect: The 2020 NBC News Exit Poll found 5% of national voters saying they cast ballots for third-party candidates in 2016, and those voters broke for Biden over Trump by more than a 2-to-1 ratio. That was in an election in which Biden beat Trump by just 20,000 votes in Wisconsin and by about 10,000 votes in Arizona and Georgia. “There is no doubt at all that Stein and Johnson cost Clinton the election in 2016, and a credible third-party vote could do the same to Biden in 2024,” said Matt Bennett, the executive vice president of public affairs at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group opposing No Labels’ effort to enter next year’s presidential contest. But No Labels and other third-party groups say there should be more choices for voters, especially when polls show supermajorities don’t want either Biden or Trump to run. “Two-thirds of the public doesn’t want the election we’re probably going to get,” said Ryan Clancy, No Labels’ chief strategist. It all raises important questions for the 2024 presidential election: Will the size of the third-party vote be closer to 2016’s? Will it look more like 2020’s? And could that affect the outcome of another presidential election? The strategists behind No Labels believe there is a hunger for an alternative to Biden and Trump, and they’re spending $70 million to launch an independent unity ticket (featuring a Democrat and a Republican) that could have ballot access in all 50 states — and that could win, they say. Getting a non-major-party candidate on the ballot can be complicated, time-consuming and expensive. But the group already has ballot access in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado and Oregon. According to a poll No Labels commissioned and released in March, 59% of registered voters nationwide said they would consider voting for a moderate independent candidate if the choices were Biden and Trump, including more than half of Democrats and Republicans, as well as 7 in 10 independents. What’s more, the No Labels poll found that in a three-person race, an unnamed moderate independent candidate gets support from 20% of all voters, compared with 33% for Trump and 28% for Biden. No Labels’ leaders stress that if they don’t have a path to victory, they ultimately won’t put forward a 2024 ticket. They also dismiss complaints that their third-party bid would disproportionately take votes away from the Democratic ticket, saying their own polling showed an equal share of Democrats and Republicans supporting an unnamed moderate independent candidate over Biden and Trump. “To sit where we are and say we know exactly how an independent ticket would impact a race, it’s cherry-picking,” said Clancy of No Labels. Democrats disagree, pointing to No Labels’ own survey, which showed Trump’s lead over Biden increasing from 1 point in a two-person contest to 5 points when it included that moderate independent candidate. And No Labels’ strategists decry Democratic efforts to knock it off the ballot, such as in Arizona, where the state Democratic Party has sued to deny it ballot access. Clancy said Democrats portray themselves as “protectors of democracy,” but he argued that efforts to keep No Labels off the ballot — and limit the presidential choices to just two parties — runs contrary to democracy. “Either you’re for democracy or not,” Clancy said. Democrats opposed to No Labels argue that the third-party group has no chance of winning in 2024. “No third-party candidate has ever come remotely close to winning, including Theodore Roosevelt, running on a Progressive Party ticket just four years after leaving office as an enormously popular Republican president,” wrote leaders of Democratic groups from the centrist Third Way to the more left-leaning MoveOn. Instead, they believe a No Labels ticket poses a real danger to Democrats — given the razor-thin margins of today’s elections and the record of what happened in 2016. “I think this is absolutely one of the easiest ways for Donald Trump to become president,” said Navin Nayak, the president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, another Democratic-leaning group opposing No Labels. Nayak also worked on Clinton’s 2016 campaign. (That having been said, third-party candidates — especially from the Libertarian Party — have helped past Democratic campaigns. When Biden won all-important Wisconsin in 2020 by 20,000 votes, the Libertarian nominee got nearly 40,000 votes.) Despite polls showing dissatisfaction with Biden and Trump as the nation’s two choices in 2024, Nayak believes the third-party vote next year will look more like it did in 2020 (when it was at 2%) than in 2016 (when it was 6%). One reason is that Biden, even stuck with relatively poor approval ratings, doesn’t produce the same level of voter opposition Clinton did in 2016. Another is that fewer Americans, Nayak said, are willing to roll the dice with Trump now than they were before he became president. “I think a lot of people thought they were casting a non-consequential third-party vote in 2016,” he said. But No Labels isn’t the only third-party group that could be on the ballot next year. Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News and an expert on third-party politics in the U.S., expects the Libertarian Party to be on the ballot in most states, and he expects the Green Party to qualify in about half the country. But he said it’s impossible to estimate — at least at this early stage — how big the third-party vote will be in next year’s election. “It’s really impossible to predict,” Winger said. “There’s so much time, and so many things could happen.” "
Impeachment trial of Texas AG Ken Paxton to begin no later than Aug. 28,The Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 6:10 AM UTC",Politics News,"AUSTIN, Texas  — A historic impeachment trial in Texas to determine whether Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton should be permanently removed from office will begin no later than August in the state Senate, where the jury that would determine his future could include his wife, Sen. Angela Paxton. Setting a schedule was one of the last orders of business lawmakers took Monday during an acrimonious end to this year’s legislative session in Texas, where the impeachment laid bare fractures in America’s biggest red state beyond whether Republicans will oust one of the GOP’s conservative legal stars. It drags Republicans — who for years have pushed fast-changing Texas further to the right — into a summer of unfinished business and soured feelings that are likely to spill into 2024’s elections. The stakes are also raised for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who couldn’t get his full agenda through the GOP-controlled Legislature on time. He almost immediately called lawmakers back to work for the first of “several” special sessions in the coming months. His announcement made no mention of Paxton, whom Abbott has remained silent on since the impeachment proceedings began last week. At the center of the conflict in the Texas Capitol is Paxton, whom the GOP-controlled House overwhelmingly impeached over the weekend on charges that include bribery and misuse of office following nearly a decade of scandal and criminal accusations that have dogged the state’s top lawyer. He is suspended from office pending trial in the state Senate, which set a start date of no later than Aug. 28. Underlining the fallout of Paxton’s impeachment, the session ended with a dozen House lawmakers walking across the building and delivering the articles of impeachment to the Senate, where there are 31 senators who could act as jurors. In a complicating twist, one of them is Angela Paxton, who has not spoken publicly since her husband’s impeachment or said whether she will recuse herself from the proceedings. She declined to comment Monday when approached by The Associated Press outside the Senate chamber. The chairman of the House investigation, Republican state Rep. Andrew Murr, also declined to comment on whether it would be appropriate for Angela Paxton to participate. “We will manage this process with the weight and reverence it deserves and requires,” Murr said. The impeachment made for a dramatic finale to the 140-day legislative session in Texas, where Republicans started the year with large GOP majorities following a dominant midterm election, a historic $33 billion surplus and a governor seen as a possible 2024 presidential contender. But instead of a smooth victory lap this spring, Republicans spent months clashing with each other over promises to cut property taxes and provide vouchers to public school students, and in the end delivered neither before time was up. Both were priorities of Abbott, who was silent as the session ended. He could also appoint an interim attorney general but has made no public comment about Paxton since impeachment proceedings began last week. Among those who have rushed to Paxton’s defense are activists on the GOP’s hard right and former President Donald Trump, the leading contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, who over the weekend posted on his social media platform that the governor was “MISSING IN ACTION!” In a state where Republicans have controlled every lever of power for decades — and have used that dominance to put Texas out front nationally over contentious measures to restrict abortion and immigration — the failure of several promises in the state Capitol underscored how they do not always move in lockstep. “There are certainly battle lines that exist within the Republican Party,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of political science at the University of Houston. “I don’t think they’re ideological. I think you could read into this that the House is tired of being pressured by far-right Republicans, and this is their way of putting in some barriers.” The rifts are not new in Texas, and more broadly, Republicans succeeded in passing a slew of measures they held up as victories for conservatives, including bans on gender-affirming care and banning offices of diversity, equity and inclusion at the state’s universities. They also put Harris County, the third-largest county in the nation and the largest in Texas that is controlled by Democrats, under new laws that forced them to fire their elections administrator and opens a path for state officials to take greater control over their elections. Paxton is only the third sitting official in Texas’ nearly 200-year history to be impeached. He called the House investigation that led up to his impeachment “corrupt” and has broadly denied wrongdoing. The raft of accusations against him include an indictment on securities fraud charges and allegations that he misused his office to try to thwart an FBI investigation into one of his donors. “What happened this week is nothing I take pride in,” House Speaker Dade Phelan told the chamber. “It is not anything I was proud of. But it was necessary. It was just.” "
New debt limit bill trashed by GOP hard-liners as party leaders push for votes,Sahil Kapur,"May 29, 2023, 8:55 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — The race is on for congressional leaders to secure the votes to pass a bipartisan compromise struck by President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to avert a catastrophic debt default with just a week to go before the June 5 deadline. Facing skepticism or criticism within their ranks, both party's leaders mobilized Monday to shore up support for the bill. House Republicans leaders held a conference call with reporters Monday to promote the agreement. “This is a historic Republican victory,” said Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., the GOP conference chair. “It will cut spending year over year.” Republican hard-liners in both chambers sniped at the deal, setting the stage for a contentious showdown Tuesday in the House Rules Committee, which is scheduled to consider the bill before an expected vote in the full House on Wednesday. Follow along for live updates Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., called the deal ""insanity"" and said the bill has ""virtually no cuts."" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, issued a torrent of tweets blasting the deal as a ""turd-sandwich."" Norman and Roy are on the Rules Committee. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said the deal has ""fake spending cuts."" ""Conservatives have been sold out once again!"" he tweeted. Still, those right-wing members may be a minority among Capitol Hill Republicans. Some are confident the bill will succeed. “Oh, this thing will absolutely pass,” Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., the chair of the center-right Main Street Caucus, told reporters. “There’s no question about that. I’ve talked to dozens of members — and listen, not every single member is on board. But when was the last time that every single member of Congress agreed on anything?” Numerous McCarthy allies touted new Congressional Budget Office estimates provided to some in Republican leadership that haven't been made public, two GOP sources said. The estimates say the Biden-McCarthy debt ceiling bill would cut $2.1 trillion in spending if the targets are met over six years — although only two years are binding in the bill. The legislation would extend the debt limit for two years and pair it with a two-year budget accord that would modestly reduce nondefense spending and bump up military spending to $886 billion — the amount Biden requested for next year. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., blasted the bill as a ""catastrophe for defense"" on Twitter, saying Biden's Defense Department spending figure was inadequate and threatening to hold up the bill in the chamber. If the House passes the bill Wednesday, the Senate would have five days to pass it by the deadline next Monday. Rep. Stephanie Bice, R-Okla., said the bill will pass with support from both parties. “We’re going to get there,"" Bice said. ""There’s going to be bipartisan support on this legislation. The president is supporting it. I think that we’re in a really good place. Spending cuts are what we asked for; no new taxes are what we asked for; no clean debt ceiling is what we asked for. And that’s exactly what we’ve got.” House progressives were silent for most of Monday as they held an afternoon call to discuss the legislation and the way forward. Privately, some expressed disappointment with provisions like expanding work requirements from people age 50 to those age 55 for federal benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. They're also unhappy that the bill would expedite the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline under construction from northwestern West Virginia to southern Virginia, and overhaul permitting for energy and infrastructure projects. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the rules about work are ""bad policy"" that wouldn't help reduce unemployment. ""We have seen reams of data that show that when you put these work requirements in, they’re really just administrative red tape that prevent the people who need help from getting help,"" she said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders sent a memo encouraging lawmakers to sell the legislation as a defeat for ""extreme MAGA Republicans"" and arguing that it rejects ""Republicans’ extreme demands to cut critical lifelines for everyday Americans."" House Democrats face some internal conflict about how to proceed, according to sources in the caucus. Apart from the policy concerns, some are upset that they were largely excluded from the negotiations and don't feel a primary responsibility to carry the bill over the line. But they're also heavily invested in political success for Biden and in protecting the U.S. economy, which some believe will be enough to gain passage. Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., the chair of the center-left New Democrat Coalition, praised the deal, saying, ""We expect that we will be involved with the White House in our Democratic leadership team in urging support for the vote."" Kuster said she is ""pleased that the debt ceiling will be raised and that we will not have this fight again until at least 2025,"" adding that the bill would protect Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy provisions and the CHIPS and Science Act. ""There will be some tough pills to swallow,"" Kuster said, citing the Mountain Valley Pipeline as a ""significant concern"" that some New Democrat Coalition members have expressed. But overall, she said, the White House negotiators ""did an outstanding job."" ""I do not see it as a transformative change in government funding or the impact on the vast majority of the American people,"" Kuster said. ""For some people's lives, it will be very significant. But for most Americans, they will not notice."" Roy, the Freedom Caucus member who is on the Rules Committee, has argued that Democrats would get more out of the deal than Republicans. He tweeted Monday that McCarthy, R-Calif., had promised ""nothing would pass Rules Committee without AT LEAST 7 GOP votes."" That came as news to other Republicans. ""That’s not my understanding at all,"" Bice said Monday. Johnson said: ""I'm a rules guy. When somebody tells me something has to happen a certain way, the first thing I do is get out the rules. And when I checked, there wasn't a rule that something has to come out of Rules unanimously."" "
"Biden marks Memorial Day nearly 2 years after ending America’s longest war, lauds troops’ sacrifice",Associated Press,"May 29, 2023, 4:33 PM UTC / Updated May 29, 2023, 6:57 PM UTC",Joe Biden,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden lauded the sacrifice of generations of U.S. troops who died fighting for their country as he marked Memorial Day with the traditional wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. Biden was joined by first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, for the 155th National Memorial Day Observance. He had a moment of contemplation in front of the wreath, which was adorned with flowers and a red, white and blue bow, and then bowed his head in prayer. “We must never forget the price that was paid to protect our democracy,” Biden said later in an address at Memorial Amphitheater. “We must never forget the lives these flags, flowers and marble markers represent.” ""Every year we remember,” he said. “And every year it never gets easier.” Monday’s federal holiday honoring America’s fallen service members came a day after Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached final agreement on a deal that would raise America’s debt limit and that now awaits approval by Congress. As it stands, the agreement would keep nondefense spending roughly flat in the 2024 fiscal year and increase it by 1% the following year. The measure would allow for 3% defense growth in fiscal 2024, to $886 billion, and then another 1% in fiscal 2025, to $895 billion. Biden has taken pride that his Democratic administration has overseen a time of relative peace for the U.S. military after two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. It’s been nearly 21 months since Biden ended the United States’ longest war in Afghanistan, making good on a campaign promise to end a 20-year-old “forever war” that cost the lives of more than 2400 U.S. service members. The war in Afghanistan, however, ended in deadly and chaotic fashion on Biden’s watch in August 2021 with critics blasting the administration’s handling of the evacuation of some 120,000 American citizens, Afghans and others as poorly planned and badly executed. The Biden administration last month released a review of the last days of the war, largely blaming his Republican predecessor, President Donald Trump, and asserting that Biden was “severely constrained” by Trump’s decisions. The U.S. now finds itself leading a coalition of allies pouring tens of billions of dollars in military and economic aid into Ukraine as it tries to repel the Russian invasion, which appears to have no end in sight. While making clear that he has no desire for U.S. troops to enter the conflict, Biden has maintained that he sees the Russian effort to grab territory as an affront to international norms and has vowed to help Kyiv win, sending artillery, tanks and drones and recently agreeing to allow allies to train Ukrainian military on American F-16 jets. Before Monday’s ceremony at the Arlington, Virginia, cemetery, the Bidens hosted a breakfast at the White House for members of veterans organizations, military service and military family organizations, surviving families of fallen U.S. troops, senior Department of Defense officials and other administration officials. The president and the first lady were scheduled to return their home near Wilmington, Delaware, later Monday to spend the rest of the federal holiday. "
This lefty commentator goes calmly where others dare not. Has he bridged the internet’s toxic divide?,Jason Abbruzzese,"May 29, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",Internet,"David Pakman can’t remember the last time he lost his cool. That’s pretty rare for someone who makes a living talking about politics online, which Pakman has done for more than 13 years. Look across YouTube or TikTok and you’ll find videos of him forcefully but calmly making the case for progressive politics, sometimes in digital venues where those politics are not particularly popular. That’s given Pakman, 39, a peculiar profile. He’s one of the few liberal pundits who is more likely to get name-checked by Steve Bannon than Rachel Maddow. He’s a more familiar figure to fans of Joe Rogan than Ezra Klein. “I don’t get into the shouting matches or the screaming matches,” he said in a recent video interview from his home, part of which also doubles as the studio where he records “The David Pakman Show.” “I don’t really consider that I’m playing a character when I do what I do. It’s really just my genuine demeanor. But it’s also calculated in the sense that I don’t think the audience is well served if I get into those shouting matches.” Another surprise is where you won’t find Pakman. He’s a liberal — a progressive social democrat, as he puts it — but he rarely pops up in many of the places to which most lefty pundits aspire. He’s never been on MSNBC (NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News and MSNBC) or written for The New York Times. Yes, he’s on Twitter (where he has 254,000 followers), but he doesn’t engage in the kinds of fights that could raise his profile. Instead, he’s made his mark in places where liberal commentators have either struggled to gain traction or hesitate to go. Many are podcasts or web shows that aren’t household names but have dedicated fan bases that skew young and male. An incomplete list of his most notable appearances: Joe Rogan’s podcast (twice), the Lex Fridman Podcast, the Pomp Podcast, Modern Wisdom and PBD Podcast. Pakman said he is not on a crusade to reach people who might not otherwise encounter progressive politics, although he does hope to do just that. Rather, Pakman said he built an audience outside the mainstream, partly as a function of his style, which provides some relief to people who have grown tired of the toxicity of internet-based political discourse. He wrote a guide available for free called “Building Arguments Without Burning Bridges.” Which is not to say Pakman pulls his punches or is above a little snark. Many of his videos focus on Republicans and conservative media with a certain measured snark. In a recent video about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential announcement on Twitter, he called the event a “global humiliation” alongside a few wry chuckles. Pakman’s home base is YouTube, where he has 1.7 million subscribers, followed by TikTok, with more than 485,000 followers. “I’m sort of in a different space,” he said. “And so the folks that are going to pay me six bucks a month for my premium content, there’s some overlap, but it’s not necessarily the same people who just have MSNBC on from 7 to 10 p.m. every day.” Pakman is a small part of a large and thriving world of online media that is either focused on politics or dabbles in it. Much of this media takes the form of shows that resemble the political radio programs of years past, anchored by magnetic personalities who have gained significant followings usually through some combination of YouTube, podcasting and, increasingly, TikTok. And like the radio world, there’s a political imbalance, with conservative and right-wing commentators finding much more success than their liberal counterparts. The subscriber numbers of Pakman and most other lefty online commentators are dwarfed by those of Ben Shapiro (2.3 million YouTube subscribers), Steven Crowder (5.9 million YouTube subscribers), Candace Owens (3.7 million Twitter followers), Matt Walsh (2.5 million YouTube subscribers) and others. It’s a digital media world so lucrative Shapiro and Crowder recently engaged in a public feud over a contract offered to Crowder worth $50 million. The conservative part of that world is also far more interconnected than its liberal equivalent, both in terms of behind-the-scenes support from conservative donors and with more mainstream media like Fox News, according to Reece Peck, an associate professor in the department of media culture at the City University of New York. That’s something creators like Pakman can’t bank on. “It’s just very difficult for progressives to get funding,” Peck said. “They just don’t have that advantage, and so they have to live and die by the algorithm and by their audiences.” Pakman, who was born in Argentina and moved to the U.S. when he was 5, started his show when he was an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst on WXOJ, an independent nonprofit radio station based outside Springfield. Meeting Cenk Uygur, host of “The Young Turks,” at a media conference convinced him to give YouTube a shot, launching his channel in September 2009. Uygur and his show went on to become one of the most successful news shows on YouTube, now counting more than 5.4 million subscribers. Since then, it’s been a relatively slow grind to where he is now. Pakman’s YouTube channel stats show more than 30,000 videos uploaded, which have accrued more than 1.5 billion views. He hasn’t had any particularly viral moments that have propelled him suddenly into the spotlight. Pakman said even some of his most high-profile appearances offered only modest subscriber bumps, but he did see considerable growth during the pandemic. Pakman said he sees his primary audience in three groups: die-hard fans who may support him vocally online and possibly financially, then more casual consumers of politics and news content who sometimes encounter him in places where he receives vehement opposition, and, lastly, people who completely disagree with him. The audience for online news has continued to grow, particularly among young people, many of whom list YouTube and TikTok as parts of their media diet. That audience has become more lucrative as social media platforms became more commercialized, said Becca Lewis, an academic who has studied digital political subcultures. Lewis added that many of those creators have flown under the mainstream radar, but that this dynamic is shifting. “Some of these figures, I would say someone like Ben Shapiro or Joe Rogan, they’ve kind of become household names in a certain sense,” Lewis said. “But a lot of people who are really popular and do have massive viewership, that really devoted viewership, don’t always get that household name recognition. It’s a different variety of fame, in a way.” Like many internet-based content creators, Pakman has a few income streams that he said are relatively even: direct sales to advertisers, ads on platforms like YouTube and subscription memberships sold through his website, which are $5 per month. It’s lucrative enough that Pakman said he has no plans to try to use his current platforms to move into a more mainstream role. He said he values the freedom he has with his own operation and being able to set his own schedule, which includes taking time to be a father to his first child, who turns 1 in June. “To be totally honest, 10 years ago, using this show to become a regular guest on some network to maybe eventually become a guest host to maybe eventually get a show would have seemed like a reasonable path,” he said. “At my current level of success, it’s no longer appealing.” "
Biden’s student debt plan hangs in balance as major Supreme Court rulings loom,Lawrence Hurley,"May 29, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — For months, the Biden administration’s ambitious plan to discharge billions of dollars of student loan debt has been on ice, blocked by lower courts, its fate left in the hands of skeptical conservative justices on the Supreme Court. Decision day is fast approaching. The stakes are high, with 43 million people eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief. The total cost if the program ever goes into effect has been calculated at more than $400 billion, with the administration estimating that 20 million people would have all of their remaining student loan debt canceled. The proposal is also important politically to President Joe Biden, as tackling student loan debt was a key pledge he made on the campaign trail in 2020 to energize younger voters. But with a conservative-majority Supreme Court suspicious of broad assertions of executive power, Biden's plan faces a significant hurdle. “We fought hard to get to this place, where the president has promised historic debt relief. We are hopeful still the Supreme Court is going to rule on the side of people who have student debt, but we are also clear-eyed,” said Mike Pierce, the executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group that works to alleviate student loan debt. The two cases on Biden’s debt relief plan are among 30 the Supreme Court has left to rule on in its current term, which traditionally concludes in the last week of June. The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is also set to rule on a host of other big issues, the most notable being another education-related dispute that could end the consideration of race in college admissions. The next day the court is expected to issue rulings is Thursday, the first day of June, with decisions coming thick and fast for the rest of the month. The flurry of rulings will put the court in the spotlight again a year after the conservative majority flexed its muscles by overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision and expanding gun rights. In the ensuing months, some have questioned the court’s legitimacy, and ethics questions have been raised about some of its members, especially conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. During oral arguments in the student loan cases in February, the conservative justices expressed doubts about whether the Biden administration had the authority to forgive huge swaths of student debt. The court is weighing two cases, one brought by Missouri and five other states and the other brought by two people who hold student loan debt. The challengers say the administration’s proposal — announced by Biden in August and originally scheduled to take effect last fall — violated the Constitution and federal law, partly because it circumvented Congress, which they said has the sole power to create laws related to student loan forgiveness. The administration has proposed forgiving up to $10,000 in debt for borrowers earning less than $125,000 a year (or couples who file taxes jointly and earn less than $250,000 annually). Pell Grant recipients, who are the majority of borrowers, would be eligible for an additional $10,000 in debt relief. The relief would have a significant impact, according to Alan Aja, a professor at Brooklyn College in New York who studies racial wealth disparities and signed a brief in support of the administration. People like his students, often members of minority groups from low-income backgrounds, would be more likely to finish their educations or consider more ambitious job opportunities or would be able to pay off other debt if Biden's plan goes into effect, he said. ""In their minds, it would be transformative,"" Aja added. In defending the plan, the Biden administration cited a 2003 law called the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act, or HEROES Act, which says the government can provide relief to recipients of student loans when there is a “national emergency,” allowing it to act to ensure people are not in “a worse position financially” as a result of the emergency. The challengers say the language in the HEROES Act is not specific enough to authorize a proposal as broad as Biden’s plan, an argument that conservative justices appeared sympathetic to. It appears the only avenue for the Biden administration to prevail would be if the court were to conclude that the challengers do not have legal standing to bring their cases in the first place because they cannot show they would be harmed by the program. If the administration were to win the case, it would not remove all potential impediments to the plan’s moving forward, as other cases are pending in lower courts, but if the challengers do not have legal standing, it would suggest other people and entities bringing cases are unlikely to do so, either. Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, said a ruling for Biden on the standing issue ""is likely to doom"" all the other cases, although other people or entities who have yet to sue could fare better. In the affirmative action cases, the conservative justices indicated they were leaning toward ending the consideration of race in college admissions in legal challenges arising from the University of North Carolina and Harvard University. A ruling along those lines could lead to a significant drop in Black and Hispanic admissions at the country’s most selective colleges and accelerate changes in the criteria used to recruit students. Other cases the justices will rule on in the coming weeks include congressional redistricting disputes from Alabama and North Carolina that could further weaken the Voting Rights Act and limit state court oversight of elections, respectively. The court will also decide a case in which an evangelical conservative Christian web designer wants to avoid being punished under a Colorado anti-discrimination law for refusing to make websites for same-sex weddings. One theme absent from this year's end-of-term narrative is retirement, with no speculation that any of the justices plan to step down from their lifetime appointments. With the court facing tough scrutiny recently, Chief Justice John Roberts was defensive in public remarks last week, indicating the court as a separate branch of government should be left to handle its own affairs. But with the term entering a period when the justices are frantically trying to finish writing rulings while they are sometimes bitterly at odds with one another, he sought to portray an institution that is humming along as usual. “I’m happy that I can continue to say there’s never been a voice raised in anger in our conference room,” he said. Speaking at the same event, liberal Justice Elena Kagan, often on the losing side in the court's biggest cases, gave a more nuanced assessment. Although she praised Roberts' qualities as a judge, she was candid about the broad areas of disagreement on the ideologically divided bench. On some of those issues, she said, “I really could tear my hair out about the things he thinks.” "
"Bipartisan agreement reached to avoid debt-limit default, Biden announces",Summer Concepcion,"May 28, 2023, 2:51 PM UTC / Updated May 29, 2023, 12:30 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"President Joe Biden on Sunday announced a debt ceiling deal he said would avoid a ""catastrophic default"" by the federal government while keeping the economy fluid. ""It takes the threat of catastrophic default off the table,"" Biden said in a brief statement about the bipartisan agreement, which would still need approval from both chambers of Congress. Biden expressed relief that the debt ceiling would not be in play for budget negotiations between Democrats and Republicans for two years. ""I strongly urge both chambers to pass that agreement,"" he said. ""Let's keep moving forward."" Biden said he had just spoken to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who earlier Sunday had expressed confidence that their debt ceiling deal would pass Congress, despite early criticism from some lawmakers. McCarthy, R-Calif., said at a news conference that he expects that over 95% of House Republicans will support the 99-page bill, the language of which he released Sunday evening. He said in a statement the deal would stop ""out-of-control"" spending by Biden as it ""forces the Executive Branch to find dollar-for-dollar savings in the government for costly rules and regulations, so that executive overreach is reined in and held accountable."" The House plans to take up the bill Wednesday after markets close, Republican senators were told. “This is going to be transformational, where Congress is literally going to vote to spend less money this year than we spent last year,” McCarthy said earlier. Asked by reporters Sunday in Washington whether he’s confident the deal will get to his desk, Biden said: “Yes.” In a statement, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, urged colleagues to quickly pass the legislation underpinning the deal. ""The Senate must act swiftly and pass this agreement without unnecessary delay,"" he said, expressing gratitude to McCarthy for helping to rein in government spending via the agreement. Negotiators struck an agreement in principle Saturday night to extend the debt ceiling. The text of the bill will be prepared by Republicans and reviewed by the Biden administration before it is finalized, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wrote Sunday in a letter to Democrats. Jeffries told his caucus that shortly after Biden and McCarthy spoke to complete the agreement, Republicans would release the bill. The tentative agreement, which is expected to raise the country's borrowing authority in exchange for cuts in spending, was struck after weeks of negotiations led by Biden and McCarthy. A source familiar with the agreement said it includes a two-year appropriations deal and a two-year extension of the debt limit, effectively resolving the issue until after the 2024 election. It will include work requirements to receive federal aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for people up to 54 years old, with exceptions for homeless people and veterans. But there will be “no changes to Medicaid,” the source said. Some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle criticized the deal on Sunday programs. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Democratic leaders should be worried about progressive support for the deal on CNN’s “State of the Union."" Jayapal, who had been briefed on the agreement, criticized the provision that would tighten work requirements for the SNAP food assistance program, calling it a ""bad policy."" “It is really unfortunate that the president opened the door to this, and while at the end of the day, you know, perhaps this will — because of the exemptions — perhaps it will be OK, I can’t commit to that. I really don’t know,” Jayapal said. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said the deal lacks Democratic priorities. Still, he said it may get some support from Democrats because it’s a “very small bill.” “Had the bill looked anything like what the Republicans passed on the floor where they rescinded all the money designed to create an electric battery industry in this country, designed to further reduce drug prices, you would have had unanimity against it,” Himes said on “Fox News Sunday.” Some Republicans swiftly disputed McCarthy’s claim that a majority of the conference was “very excited” about the deal. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., took issue with the defense spending proposals, saying it would be a “joke” to adopt what he characterized as Biden’s defense budget. “I want to raise the debt ceiling. It would be irresponsible not to do it,” Graham said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I want to control spending.  I’d like to have a smaller IRS. I’d like to claw back the unused Covid money. And I know you can’t get to perfect, but what I will not do is adopt the Biden defense budget and call it as success.” And Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, called the bill a “turd-sandwich” in a tweet. Two GOP negotiators, Reps. Garret Graves of Louisiana and Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, defended the deal Sunday afternoon. “A lot of the things people have been saying or alleging, they’re just not accurate,” Graves said. “I’m confident once the text gets out people are going to recognize that, you know, we’re actually in a pretty good spot.” Graves and McHenry explained the discrepancies between White House and Republican spending estimates, saying the bill would roll back discretionary spending to levels from fiscal year 2022 — which was in the GOP bill the House passed weeks ago. They also said they aren’t counting $121 billion in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, as the White House is. Once the legislative language is finalized, it will have to pass both the GOP-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate. In a letter to Senate Democrats on Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said senators should prepare for potential votes Friday and next weekend. Meanwhile, McCarthy said that he has already spoken to McConnell and that he will soon brief Senate Republicans on a conference call. White House officials will hold separate briefings with House Democrats and Senate Democrats on Sunday evening, a source familiar with the plans said. Both briefings will be conducted by Shalanda Young, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget; John Podesta, Biden’s senior adviser on clean energy; and Aviva Aron-Dine, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, two Democratic sources said. House Republicans called the agreement ""The Fiscal Responsibility Act"" in a memo circulated to members Saturday night. “Republicans will restore fiscal sanity and hold Washington accountable,” the memo read. Last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen extended the deadline to act or risk breaching the debt ceiling to June 5. She had previously been less specific, saying the U.S. could run out of money “potentially as early as June 1.” The Treasury Department hit the statutory borrowing limit in January and has been using “extraordinary measures” to pay the country’s bills.

Senate veterans: Supreme Court fight has roots in years of partisan combat,Alexandra Marquez,"May 28, 2023, 3:00 PM UTC",Supreme Court,"Recent reports about luxury gifts, travel and tuition for a minor under his care that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas received but did not disclose have left some lawmakers to consider steps to increase ethics requirements to restore trust in the Supreme Court. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the chair of the Judiciary subcommittee on federal courts, said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"": ""The work that we're doing on ethics in the court ought to be easy. And yet it's not. It's partisan, also."" To address that, Whitehouse said, it is first and foremost up to the justices themselves to start the reform process. ""The first step is going to be for the Judicial Conference, the other judges, to put some constraints around the Supreme Court's behavior and treat the Supreme Court the way all other federal judges are treated. And that happens inside the judiciary,"" Whitehouse said. The Judicial Conference of the United States, made up of senior federal judges led by the chief justice of the U.S., is the primary policymaking body for the federal court system. Polling indicates that Americans are losing confidence in the court, with Democrats souring on it more than Republicans. A Marquette University Law School poll released this month found that 59% of Americans do not approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Among Republicans, 60% approved of the job the court is doing, and 40% disapproved. Among Democrats, just 24% approved of the court, and 76% disapproved. Other recent surveys, including AP-NORC’s poll series spanning decades, have found public confidence in the Supreme Court hitting all-time lows. Whitehouse said that, if necessary, Congress could step in to pass its own laws regulating the court. ""I'll be the first one to concede: If there's a case in the judicial branch of government, we in the Congress have nothing to say about it,"" Whitehouse said. ""But in terms of administering how the internal ethics of the judicial branch are done, heck, the Judicial Conference, which does that, is a creation of Congress,"" he added. Former Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., disagreed, saying on ""Meet the Press"" that the Supreme Court is different by its nature as a body established by the Constitution. ""Every one of the other courts was created by Congress,"" Blunt said. ""Only one court is created by the Constitution, and that's the Supreme Court of the United States. ""The relationship in those other courts is different than the relationship with the Supreme Court. And the chief justice and the justices have to make, in my view, this particular decision about conduct and rules,"" he added. Blunt and Whitehouse put the furor over the Supreme Court in the context of the increasingly bitter partisan fighting over the makeup of the judiciary in recent decades. ""It would be better for the country if the Supreme Court and the nominations process had not been so heavily politicized and we were operating under what more looks like a regular order,"" Whitehouse said about the Senate's role in confirming federal judges and Supreme Court justices. Still, he backed then-Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid's decision to end the use of the filibuster for federal district and appeals court nominees, which meant the minority party could not block judges from coming up for simple majority votes. ""We saw back then that there was no amount of persuasion that could convince Republicans to vote for D.C. Circuit Democratic nominees. And that’s why Harry had to do what he had to do,"" Whitehouse said. Blunt also lamented the lowering of confidence in the court, though he backed then-Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's decision not to allow hearings on Merrick Garland's nomination to the court in the final year of the Obama administration. Blunt blamed the Supreme Court's declining ratings on larger societal problems, rather than partisanship. ""There's another thing going on in the way we deal with each other as a society. It's easy to tear, friends, people down on social media and other places,"" he said. Blunt added: ""We've done that to the Congress. We've done that to the president. I hope we can figure out how to avoid taking this court that we all should have confidence in"" down that road. "
White House and Republicans reach tentative debt ceiling deal,Sahil Kapur,"May 28, 2023, 12:55 AM UTC / Updated May 28, 2023, 1:19 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — Key negotiators struck an agreement in principle Saturday night to extend the debt ceiling and avert a catastrophic default, just days before the Treasury Department said the U.S. could run out of money, Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Saturday. The deal — which is expected to raise the country's borrowing authority in exchange for cuts to spending — still has to be converted into legislative language and pass both the Republican-led House and Democratic-controlled Senate. It follows weeks of negotiations led by President Joe Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy, amid demands by the GOP to extract spending cuts in exchange for allowing the nation to continue to payits bills. ""We’ve come to an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people,"" McCarthy said Saturday on Twitter. ""We still have more work to do tonight to finish all the writing of it,"" McCarthy told reporters outside his Capitol office, adding that he expects to post the text on Sunday and hold a House vote on it Wednesday. He added that he'll speak to Biden again on Sunday. A source familiar with the agreement said it includes a two-year appropriations deal and a two-year debt limit extension, effectively resolving the issue until after the 2024 election. It'll include work requirements for receiving federal aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP,  for Americans up to age 54, with exceptions for homeless people and veterans. But there will be ""no changes to Medicaid,"" the source added. By averting the crisis, the White House would be sidestepping a first-ever default that threatens to wipe out millions of jobs and devastate the American economy, rocking faith in Biden's leadership  — and the divided Congress — as he embarks on a re-election bid. Biden and McCarthy spent an hour and a half on a call Saturday night, a rare one-on-one conversation between the two leaders that followed days of fraught talks over the final sticking points. Top Republicans had been in and out of the speaker's office on Saturday as negotiations continued, with some of the talks taking place virtually and by phone. Shalanda Young, a top negotiator for the White House, was in Louisiana to deliver graduation remarks at Xavier University where she quipped that the two-hour break was ""the most fun I’ve had in two weeks.” Republican leaders began preparing to sell a bill to the GOP conference late Friday with a deal still out of reach. Conservatives skeptical of Republican leadership had threatened to hold up the bill if the speaker struck a deal with Democrats that failed to slash spending, with one outside adviser warning of coming “trench warfare.” McCarthy has said in recent days he'll give members 72 hours to review the text before holding a floor vote. And Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has threatened to block a speedy vote in the Senate if he isn't satisfied with the terms of the deal, meaning it could take days for the chamber to jump through procedural hoops before a vote. Extending the debt ceiling doesn’t authorize new spending into the future; it enables the U.S. to pay existing debts that both parties have accumulated over many years through demands for higher spending on domestic and military programs, as well as lower taxes. Negotiating staff for McCarthy and the White House held back-to-back negotiating sessions, some stretching late into the night before resuming again. The Republican push to add work requirements to social safety net programs remained an obstacle until the final moment. By the time a deal was announced Saturday, Democratic angst was reduced to a low simmer. Biden's low profile in the talks had drawn consternation from some members of his party who feared the president was ceding the messaging war to Republicans. Calls for Biden to use the bully pulpit of his office took on a fevered pitch as some worried about the need to sell a bill with deep concessions to voters next year. Vice President Kamala Harris, who had entered the talks publicly one week earlier before helming a glitchy Zoom call, had also kept a low profile. As anxiety mounted, so did pressure on Biden not to turn away from options to tackle the debt unilaterally, such as invoking the 14th Amendment. “The only option right now is for Congress to do their jobs without conditions,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. On Friday, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo ruled it out with a firm “no.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen set a June 5 deadline for when the government was expected to blow through the debt limit, heightening pressure in the final days.

"Henry Kissinger, former U.S. diplomat, celebrates 100th birthday",The Associated Press,"May 27, 2023, 10:46 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Former diplomat and presidential adviser Henry Kissinger marks his 100th birthday on Saturday, outlasting many of his political contemporaries who guided the United States through one of its most tumultuous periods including the presidency of Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War. Born in Germany on May 27, 1923, Kissinger remains known for his key role in American foreign policy of the 1960s and 1970s including eventual attempts to pull the U.S. out of Vietnam, but not before he became inextricably linked to many of the conflict’s most disputed actions. David Kissinger, writing in The Washington Post on Thursday, said his father’s centenary “might have an air of inevitability for anyone familiar with his force of character and love of historical symbolism. Not only has he outlived most of his peers, eminent detractors and students, but he has also remained indefatigably active throughout his 90s.” The elder Kissinger will celebrate this week with visits to New York, London and his hometown of Fürth, Germany, David Kissinger wrote. In recent years Kissinger has continued to hold sway over Washington’s power brokers as an elder statesman. He has provided advice to Republican and Democratic presidents, including the White House during the Trump administration, while maintaining an international consulting business through which he delivers speeches in the German accent he has not lost since fleeing the Nazi regime with his family when he was a teenager. As recently as this month, Kissinger opined that the war in Ukraine is reaching a turning point with China entering negotiations. He told CBS News that he expects negotiations to come to a head “by the end of the year.” He has called for peace through negotiation to end the conflict. Kissinger also coauthored a book about artificial intelligence in 2021 called “The Age of AI: And Our Human Future.” He has warned that governments should prepare for the potential risks associated with the technology. During eight years as a national security adviser and secretary of state, Kissinger was involved in major foreign policy events including the first example of “shuttle diplomacy” seeking Middle East peace, secret negotiations with China to defrost relations between the burgeoning superpowers and the instigation of the Paris peace talks seeking an end to the Vietnam conflict and the U.S. military’s presence there. Kissinger, along with Nixon, also bore the brunt of criticism from American allies when North Vietnamese communist forces took Saigon in 1975 as the remaining U.S. personnel fled what is now known as Ho Chi Minh City. Kissinger additionally was accused of orchestrating the expansion of the conflict into Laos and Cambodia, enabling the rise of the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime that killed an estimated 2 million Cambodians. Among his endorsements, Kissinger was recognized as a central driver in the period of detente, a diplomatic effort between the U.S. and the Soviet Union beginning in 1967 through 1979 to reduce Cold War tensions with trade and arms negotiations including the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks treaties. Kissinger remained one of Nixon’s most trusted advisers through his administration from 1969 to 1974, his power only growing through the Watergate affair that brought down the 37th president. Gerald Ford, who as vice president ascended to the Oval Office following his predecessor’s resignation, awarded Kissinger the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977, saying Kissinger “wielded America’s great power with wisdom and compassion in the service of peace.” Others have accused Kissinger of more concern with power than harmony during his tenure in Washington, enacting realpolitik policies favoring American interests while assisting or emboldening repressive regimes in Pakistan, Chile and Indonesia.

"Harris, 1st woman to give commencement speech at West Point, welcomes cadets to ‘unsettled world’",The Associated Press,"May 27, 2023, 4:55 PM UTC",White House,"Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman to deliver a commencement speech at West Point, lauded graduating cadets Saturday for their noble sacrifice in serving their country, but noted they we're entering an “unsettled world” because of Russian aggression and the rising threats from China. “The world has drastically changed,” Harris told the roughly 950 graduating cadets. She referred to the global pandemic that took millions of lives and the fraught shifts in global politics in Europe and in Asia. “It is clear you graduate into an increasingly unsettled world where long-standing principles are at risk,” she said. As the U.S. ended two decades of war in Afghanistan, the longest in the country’s history, the vice president again condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the first major ground war in Europe since World War II. She also warned cadets to be wary of China, as it rapidly modernizes its military and muscles for control of parts of the high seas, ostensibly referring to the brewing disputes over the South China Sea. Harris made no mention in her address about the ongoing skirmishing in Washington, where the White House and congressional Republicans try to avert a debt crisis. In her speech, Harris touched on the importance of having institutions reflect the diversity of the broader United States, making the comment at an institution that has made slow progress diversifying its ranks in the four decades since the first class of female cadets graduated. Today, about one quarter of the student body are women. Only a few dozen graduates each year are Black women, like Harris, though the number has ticked up in recent years. The academy didn’t admit women until 1976 and had its first female graduates in 1980. "
The ugly proxy war over Feinstein's Senate seat,Alex Seitz-Wald,"May 27, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",2024 Election,"LOS ANGELES — California Gov. Gavin Newsom may soon earn the rare distinction of having selected both of his state’s senators — but he’s not happy about the prospect, according to those close to him. As Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 89, charts an uncertain path in Washington after having returned to work following a health issue, the fight over whether she should remain and the fate of the Senate seat she occupies have devolved into an ugly proxy war in California among the three high-profile Democrats vying to replace her, with Newsom stuck in the middle. Feinstein has already announced she intends to retire at the end of her term next year, setting up a crowded primary fight. But if she were to vacate the seat before then, Newsom would name someone to finish the term — a selection that would be seen as tipping the scales in the primary. Two years ago after he picked Sen. Alex Padilla to fill an empty seat, Newsom promised on MSNBC to select a Black woman for any future vacancies, which was widely understood to be a nod to Rep. Barbara Lee. That, however, was before Lee jumped into the Senate race; before powerful Democrats like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi went all in for one of her rivals, Rep. Adam Schiff; and before some of Newsom’s own allies went to work for the third candidate in the race, Rep. Katie Porter. “Newsom always says that he hates these” appointments, said a California Democratic strategist who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. “He talks about how you make one person temporarily happy and piss off a million others. I didn’t really believe him on the others — but I do believe him on this one. ""Any decision pisses off someone important,"" the strategist added. ""There's more of a downside than upside to just about anything you do."" Newsom, who gets lobbied about the Senate seat everywhere he goes, is sure to be inundated by opinions at the California Democratic Party's convention in Los Angeles this weekend, which will bring together thousands of delegates, activists and power brokers from across the massive state. “Emails, calls, texts, people stopping me. I’m not kidding,” Newsom said in an interview with KTTV of Los Angeles this month about the lobbying efforts over the Senate seat — which, to be clear, remains occupied. “This is one of the biggest topics here, and it was one of the biggest topics when I was in Alabama, even Jackson, Mississippi.” Three years after he appointed Padilla — when Kamala Harris vacated the seat to become vice president — he understands why people are wary of his possibly doing it again. “For those that say enough of Newsom making those picks — I get it, I’m with you!” Newsom said. The decision to select Padilla was far less controversial, but it nonetheless frustrated powerful Black Democrats — key allies the ambitious Newsom doesn’t want to alienate as he eyes a potential future presidential campaign. The California Democratic Party’s Black Caucus was “incredibly hurt and disappointed in the governor’s decision” to replace the only Black woman in the Senate with a Latino man, the group’s chairperson, Taisha Brown, said at the time. “Through a stroke of a pen, his actions have denied a Black female representation in the United States Senate.” This time, the stakes are even higher. Many Black Democrats are doing everything they can to push Newsom to stick by his pledge to appoint a Black woman, by which they typically mean Lee. But other California Democrats, especially those allied with Schiff or Porter, insist on the opposite just as vehemently. They argue that Newsom would unfairly be putting his thumb on the scale of the primary by elevating Lee, a less well-known lawmaker from Oakland, a critical boost in statewide name recognition and the power of incumbency. Meanwhile, Newsom’s kitchen cabinet of outside political advisers is divided among all three candidates, making it difficult for him to fully trust their advice. A former spokesperson works for Porter, another runs a super PAC supporting Lee, and the powerful firm run by Newsom’s consultants manages a pro-Schiff super PAC. Many party insiders wonder whether Newsom regrets having made his pledge before the race kicked off, but Rusty Hicks, the state Democratic Party chairman, said, “I have no doubt the governor will honor his commitments.” Some have floated other ideas to try to defuse the situation. What about a different Black woman? Or a caretaker, like former Sen. Barbara Boxer? “I saw Barbara recently, and I can’t imagine her agreeing to that. She loves her semi-retired life in Palm Springs! She and Stewart were happy and thriving,” said Boxer’s former campaign manager, Rose Kapolczynski. And Newsom has seen firsthand that caretakers can’t necessarily be counted on to stay in their assigned roles. When Newsom was elected lieutenant governor in 2010, he cleared the path for San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors to replace him as mayor with a caretaker, Ed Lee, who had promised not to run in the upcoming election. The next year, Lee changed his mind and ran for and won a full term as mayor. Of course, there are plenty of other qualified Black women in California, but Lee allies are trying to enforce solidarity on her behalf. “It will be very difficult to find a Black woman to take that seat as an appointment when they know that the only reason they’re being appointed is just to block another Black woman from holding that seat long-term,” said the chairman of the California Progressive Caucus, Amar Shergill, a vocal Lee supporter. “So the pressure is on to make sure that never happens.” Meanwhile, the behind-the-scenes sniping has turned nastier. Lee supporters accuse Schiff and his so-called establishment allies, like Pelosi, of manipulating the ailing Feinstein to stay in office to block Lee, which they have denied. Pelosi says she wants to let Feinstein make her own decision, seeing sexism in the push to force her to retire. Feinstein's allies have pointed to men in similar health who weren't pushed out of the Senate. Feinstein’s standing with Californians continues to deteriorate as questions mount about her physical and cognitive health. Two-thirds of registered voters agree she is “no longer fit to continue serving in the U.S. Senate,” according to a new poll from the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies. Just 27% said she should stay in office. But voters were split over whether they want Newsom to make an appointment to replace her and whether she should somehow be forced out of office. “The poll clearly shows that while support for Sen. Feinstein has waned considerably since 2018, there is no clear consensus about how the process should play out,” said the survey’s co-director G. Cristina Mora. Inside the cavernous Los Angeles Convention Center, the party’s grassroots faithful were also divided over how to handle the situation, with even some Feinstein critics resigned to the fact that path of least resistance might be for her to stay. Jacob Rodriguez, 23, a delegate from Imperial County, was considering introducing a resolution that would “diplomatically” ask Feinstein to step down. He knows it’s a long shot and would likely just be symbolic, but he said it’s past time for a younger person to take over. “It sounds mean, but it’s a chamber that’s in charge of the whole country. They should all be of sound mind,” Rodriguez said. But Charlene Lefaive, 71, and Sherry Chavarría, 66, delegates from Tulare County in Central California’s agricultural belt, said Feinstein shouldn’t go anywhere. “To take a person and judge them based off their health issues is absolutely horrific,"" Lefaive said. Added Chavarría: “She’s wonderful. We still need her.” "
Ohio banned August elections. Then the GOP planned one that could help preserve an abortion ban.,Adam Edelman,"May 27, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Elections,"Earlier this year, Ohio Republicans enacted a law that effectively scrubbed August special elections from the state’s calendar, calling them overly expensive, low turnout endeavors that weren't worth the trouble. But then, just earlier this month, Ohio state legislative Republicans went ahead and scheduled an August election this year that could make it harder for abortion-rights supporters to amend the state constitution later. The ballot measure currently up for a vote in August would raise the threshold of support required for future state constitutional amendments to 60%. Currently, just a majority is needed. And while there's nothing explicitly mentioning abortion, abortion-rights groups contend that they’re designed to make it more difficult for voters to pass a proposed amendment, set to be on the ballot in November, that would enshrine abortion rights in the Ohio Constitution. It’s an unmistakable contradiction that caught the attention of activists — and now they’re suing to have this August’s special election nixed. “This election is illegal,” said Dr. Marcela Azevedo, the president and founder of Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights, a group that has led efforts supporting the November ballot measure that would legalize abortion. “Based on the decisions made earlier this year, there is no basis for holding this election, other than people’s personal agendas to stop the abortion rights movement from being successful.” The suit draws heavily on the fact that the newly scheduled August special election would appear to violate statutes, signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in January, that eliminated the scheduling of virtually all August special elections. Supporters of that law — including DeWine and Ohio’s Republican secretary of state, Frank LaRose — had said holding August special elections wasn't worth the tens of millions of dollars in costs. “These unnecessary off-cycle elections aren’t good for taxpayers, election officials or the civic health of our state. It’s time for them to go,” LaRose, who has said he’s likely to run for U.S. Senate in 2024, testified during legislative hearings late last year. But earlier this month, Ohio Republicans passed a joint resolution that scheduled an Aug. 8 special election to raise the threshold for future ballot measures and impose higher signature-gathering thresholds to put measures before voters. “This is essentially a brazen, cynical, power grab,” said Emma Olson Sharkey, counsel at the Elias Law Group, a Democratic-aligned firm that filed the suit challenging this summer’s special election in Ohio. “They’re attempting to change their view of this now, based on the fact that this is now what they want to happen.” “There’s no way to reconcile these arguments,” added David Fox, a partner at the same firm, which filed the suit on behalf of the “One Person One Vote” organization that is drumming up turnout to vote “no” in the August election. Raising the threshold for passage of any future constitutional amendments would mark a major shift in Ohio, where a simple majority requirement has been in place since 1912. Four former Ohio governors, including Republicans John Kasich and Bob Taft, and five former Ohio attorneys general, including Republicans Betty Montgomery and Jim Petro, have said they oppose the measure to raise the threshold. Republican supporters of the freshly passed measures — which, because were adopted through a joint resolution, didn’t require the governor’s signature — have said they would protect the state constitution from efforts seeking to change it funded by out-of-state “special interests.” GOP supporters of both the January measure eliminating August special elections and the latest measure scheduling one this summer did not address the contradiction when asked by NBC News. “While we don’t comment on litigation or potential litigation, under Ohio’s constitution, the general assembly has the sole authority to set the time, place and manner for an election,” LaRose spokesperson Rob Nichols said in a statement. “We are fully confident that the election professionals who run our county boards of elections will faithfully deliver another secure, accessible and accurate election for Ohio voters.” State Rep. Brian Stewart, who sponsored the latest joint resolution but who also supported the January bill, said in a statement that there was no contradiction. He attributed his support for the January bill to concerns over cost and turnout for smaller, local elections in August. “That concern does not exist in the context of a statewide election, which will be in every community in Ohio,” Stewart said. DeWine, for his part, has said he supports raising the threshold required to amend the state constitution, though his spokesperson noted to NBC News that the measure scheduling an August election was passed without needing the governor’s signature. “The Ohio General Assembly generally has the power to set the dates of elections under the Ohio Constitution. Both the elections bill and this separate resolution can be seen as the Ohio General Assembly exercising that power. Our office was not a party to the resolution,” DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney said in a statement. Meanwhile, the suit (as well as another filed by the Elias Law Group alleging that the language on the ballot for the Aug. 8 election was designed to intentionally mislead voters), has been granted an expedited process by the Ohio Supreme Court. The Ohio Supreme Court — on which conservatives hold a 4-3 advantage — is expected to decide on the matter quickly. If the August election is carried out as scheduled and voters pass the threshold measure, then the proposed amendment in November to enshrine abortion rights would need 60% of voters to pass. If it fails in August, it would need just a majority. The proposed November amendment is designed to counteract Ohio’s “heartbeat bill,” which snapped into place immediately after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. That law effectively bans most abortions — but includes exceptions for the health of the pregnant woman and in cases of ectopic pregnancies — though it remains temporarily blocked by a state judge. Pro-abortion rights groups, however, aren’t holding their breath for a favorable ruling from the state's high court and are continuing their organizing on a “vote no” effort for the August ballot. “Do I think that the [state] Supreme Court should strike it down as illegal? Absolutely. I think that would be the right thing to do,” said Azevedo. “But I am not confident that they will.” “So we have to be ready to fully support ‘vote no’ in August,” she said. "
Judge halts South Carolina’s new stricter abortion law until state Supreme Court review,The Associated Press,"May 27, 2023, 4:51 AM UTC",Abortion Rights,"COLUMBIA, S.C. — A judge put South Carolina’s new law banning most abortions around six weeks of pregnancy on hold Friday until the state Supreme Court can review the measure, giving providers a temporary reprieve in a region that has enacted strict limits on the procedure. Judge Clifton Newman’s ruling that put the state’s abortion law back at roughly 20 weeks came about 24 hours after Gov. Henry McMaster signed the bill into law without any notice, which had left dozens of people seeking abortions in limbo and created the potential for a legal abortion becoming illegal as a doctor performed it. “It’s extraordinarily difficult not only for the women themselves, but for their doctors — not just the doctors at Planned Parenthood — but hospitals all across the state who need to understand what to do in an emergency,” said Vicki Ringer, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood in South Carolina. The developments in South Carolina are a microcosm of what has played out across the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade a year ago, allowing states to decide their abortion laws and leaving patients scrambling to find care wherever they can in situations where weeks or even days can make a huge difference. The South Carolina measure joins stiff limitations pending in North Carolina and Florida, states that had been holdouts in the South providing wider access to the procedure, threatening to further delay abortions as appointments pile up in the region. The state has seen the number of abortions climb sharply as other Southern states passed near-total bans. Before the overturn of Roe, less than 1 in 10 abortions in South Carolina were performed on people who lived out of state. Now, that figure is near 50% and the number of abortions each month has at least tripled, according to state health data. The law passed Tuesday by the General Assembly is similar to a ban on abortion once cardiac activity can be detected that lawmakers passed in 2021. The state Supreme Court decided in a 3-2 ruling that the 2021 law violated the state constitution’s right to privacy. Legislative leaders said the new law makes technical tweaks that should sway at least one justice to change his mind. But Newman said it wasn’t his role to figure out if that would be successful. “The status quo should be maintained until the Supreme Court reviews its decision,” Newman said. “It’s going to end up there.” Hours after the ruling, lawyers for the state asked the Supreme Court to either cancel Newman’s order or hear the case as quickly as possible to “protect the lives of countless unborn children,” they wrote in court papers. Planned Parenthood immediately sued after the law went into effect Thursday, saying South Carolina’s abortion clinics were flooded with canceled appointments from patients further along in their pregnancies and doctors were forced to carefully review the new regulations on the fly. The abortion rights group said the new law was so similar to the old one that clinics and women seeking treatment would be harmed if it were allowed to stay in effect until a full court review. Nearly all of the 75 women with appointments for abortions over the next several days appeared to be past six weeks, Planned Parenthood attorney Kathleen McDaniel said. “There is irreputable harm. It is happening. It has already happened,” McDaniel said. "
Prosecutors say they have a recording of Trump and a witness in Manhattan DA case,Adam Reiss,"May 26, 2023, 11:32 PM UTC",Trump investigations,"Prosecutors in New York have informed attorneys for Donald Trump that the evidence in their hush money case against the former president includes an audio recording of him and a witness, a court filing made public Friday shows. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office made the disclosure in a filing this week called an automatic discovery form and said the evidence had already been disclosed to Trump's attorneys. The filing does not identify the witness or say when the recording was made or when Trump's lawyers were made aware of it. NBC News has reached out to attorneys and a spokesperson for Trump for a response. A key witness in the case, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, previously released a secretly taped audio recording of a discussion he had with Trump about the hush money payments in 2016. It's unclear if the recording referred to in the court filing is the same one. The filing is dated this past Tuesday — the same day Trump made a virtual appearance in Manhattan criminal court to be formally notified about a protective order barring him from speaking publicly about evidence his lawyers were slated to receive from the DA's office. Trump was charged last month with 34 counts of falsifying business records and has pleaded not guilty. The charges involve hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal toward the end of his 2016 presidential campaign to prevent them from speaking about their allegations of affairs with him. Trump has denied having affairs with both women. In the previously disclosed recorded September 2016 conversation between Trump and Cohen, the pair can be heard discussing how to structure payments to McDougal. At one point, Trump appears to ask “what financing?” and seems to ask “pay with cash?” Cohen responds, “No, no, no, no, no, no, I got ...” before Trump is heard saying the word “check.” The filing said several other recordings that don't directly include Trump will also be turned over to his defense team, including phone conversations between two unidentified witnesses, a phone conversation ""between a witness and a third party"" and ""various recordings saved on a witness’s cell phones."" Other evidence includes unidentified statements from numerous books on or involving the former president, including books by Cohen, Daniels, former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, former Trump adviser and current son-in-law Jared Kushner and five of Trump's own books. The case is scheduled to go to trial on March 25, 2024. "
South Dakota governor calls on college board to ban drag shows and eliminate 'preferred pronouns',Associated Press,"May 26, 2023, 10:58 PM UTC",OUT Politics and Policy,"PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — Republican Gov. Kristi Noem opened a hotline for complaints about South Dakota colleges and is calling on the state’s higher education governing board to ban drag shows, Noem announced Friday. In a letter to the South Dakota Board of Regents, Noem said states have allowed “liberal ideologies to poison their colleges and universities.” “On campuses across the country, students have been taught the importance of diversity and equity and given access to ‘safe spaces’ instead of learning to tolerate the disagreement, discomfort, and dissent that they will experience in the real world,” Noem wrote. She called on the college oversight board to increase graduation rates, remove references to “preferred pronouns” in school materials, cut administrative costs and ensure universities are not accepting any money from China. Noem pitched the hotline to regents as a way to “keep our institutions accountable — and ensure that we are all aware of what is happening at our taxpayer-funded colleges and universities.” She added that information gathered from the hotline will guide policy changes. “As I work with our Board of Regents and Board of Technical Education to chart our path for higher education, we are giving students, faculty, and parents this tool to help voice any concerns so that they can be addressed,” Noem said in a statement. The Board of Regents in December ordered a review of university campus events and its policy on minors attending them after a drag show at South Dakota State University faced criticism from conservative lawmakers for being advertised as family friendly.

Iowa Gov. Reynolds signs bill restricting instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity,Associated Press,"May 26, 2023, 9:25 PM UTC",OUT Politics and Policy,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa teachers will be banned from raising gender identity and sexual orientation issues with students through grade six, and all books depicting sex acts will be removed from school libraries, under a bill Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed Friday. The new law is among similar measures that have been approved in other Republican-dominated statehouses around the country. As with many of those proposals, Iowa Republicans framed their action as a commonsense effort to ensure that parents can oversee what their children are learning in school and that teachers not delve into topics such as gender and sexuality. Despite the opposition of all Democratic legislators, Republicans who hold large majorities in Iowa’s state House and Senate approved the measure in April and there was little doubt that Reynolds would sign it; she had made issues related to gender identity and sexuality a focal point of her legislative agenda this year. “This legislative session, we secured transformational education reform that puts parents in the driver’s seat, eliminates burdensome regulations on public schools, provides flexibility to raise teacher salaries, and empowers teachers to prepare our kids for their future,” Reynolds said in a statement. Under the new law, school administrators also would be required to notify parents if students asked to change their pronouns or names. Religious texts will be exempt from the library ban on books depicting sex acts. Democrats and LGBTQ groups argued that the restrictions would hurt children by limiting their ability to be open with teachers about gender and sexuality issues and to see their lives reflected in books and other curriculum. The law’s passage was not a surprise, said Keenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy at the LGBTQ equality group One Iowa. “Like many other pieces of her agenda, this legislation punches down on a vulnerable group of kids, and it benefits no one,” Crow said of Reynolds. The law also requires schools to post online a list of books in libraries, along with instructions for parents on how to review them and classroom instructional material, and to request that any material be removed. Schools would need parental approval before they could give surveys to students related to numerous topics, including mental health issues, sex and political affiliation. Earlier this year, Reynolds signed two bills into law restricting the restrooms transgender students can use and banning gender-affirming medical care, such as puberty blockers, for people younger than 18. Last year, Reynolds signed a Republican-backed measure that prohibits transgender women and girls from participating in high school and college athletics. Like the newest law, both measures echo bills passed by Republican states around the country. "
Self-proclaimed 'idiot' Oath Keeper sentenced to more than 8 years in Jan. 6 case,Ryan J. Reilly,"May 26, 2023, 3:59 PM UTC / Updated May 26, 2023, 9:06 PM UTC",Capitol riot,"WASHINGTON — A military veteran who stormed the U.S. Capitol with the Oath Keepers on Jan. 6 was sentenced to 8½ years in federal prison Friday after apologizing for her actions. Jessica Watkins told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that her actions were ""reprehensible,"" and apologized for the impact that her conduct had on the country. “My actions and my behaviors that fateful day were wrong, and as I now understand, criminal,” she said. “Violence is never the answer.” Watkins, recalling her testimony during her trial, said once again that she was “just another idiot"" running around the Capitol on Jan. 6, and apologized to the officers. “I was just another idiot running around the Capitol,"" she said. ""But idiots are held responsible, and today you’re going to hold this idiot responsible."" Watkins' sentence came the day after Mehta sentenced Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes to 18 years in federal prison and Florida Oath Keeper Kelly Meggs to 12 years. Mehta said that Watkins' behavior was not as bad as that of Rhodes or Meggs, but that it was still serious and that she also played a role in bringing others to Washington on Jan. 6. “Nobody would suggest you’re Stewart Rhodes, and frankly, I don’t think you’re Kelly Meggs,” the judge said. But she was more than just a foot soldier, he added. "
"The U.S. now has until June 5 to act on the debt ceiling, Yellen says",Sahil Kapur,"May 26, 2023, 8:44 PM UTC / Updated May 26, 2023, 8:56 PM UTC",White House,"WASHINGTON — The United States has a few more days than expected before it runs out of money, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter Friday afternoon. The new deadline to act or risk breaching the debt ceiling is June 5, Yellen said, setting a hard deadline for the first time. She had previously been less specific, saying the breach could occur ""potentially as early as June 1."" The Treasury Department hit the statutory borrowing limit in January and has since been using “extraordinary measures” to pay the country's bills. “Based on the most recent available data, we now estimate that Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government’s obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5,” Yellen wrote to congressional leaders. The letter comes as the White House and House Republican negotiators still haven't reached a deal. It gives the negotiating teams a modest reprieve as they remain stuck on several issues in the discussions, including work requirements and how to handle federal spending in the coming years. The two parties have been sorting through their differences on spending levels. But a major hangup is the Republican demand to impose tougher work requirements for Americans to receive federal benefits like SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, two sources familiar with the talks said. Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana, who is leading negotiations for House Republicans, said it’s “totally appropriate” for an older group of able-bodied Americans without dependents to be subject to work requirements in order to get federal aid. “The White House has been very difficult on this issue,” Graves told reporters. “And I’ll tell you, it’s critical.” Democrats say work requirements already exist for federal programs and argue that stricter policies would create more red tape and throw eligible Americans who don’t complete the paperwork correctly off the rolls, and that work requirements have little impact on unemployment. Graves said he spoke to White House negotiator Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Friday and that the two sides continue to have “a very candid conversation about how we’re going to move forward — if we’re going to be able to come together and ultimately get an agreement.” The two camps are also discussing pulling back unspent Covid relief funds and overhauling permitting for infrastructure and energy projects as part of an agreement. The White House is pushing for a two-year debt limit extension in any deal, three sources with knowledge of the talks said, but GOP leaders have not publicly said whether they’ll agree to that. There is “progress being made,” a source familiar with the talks said earlier Friday. “Don’t think it’s likely today, but we’re close.”Yellen pleaded with Congress to act quickly. ""We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,"" she wrote. ""In fact, we have already seen Treasury’s borrowing costs increase substantially for securities maturing in early June. If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, it would cause severe hardship to American families, harm our global leadership position, and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests.""

John Durham to testify before House Judiciary Committee in June,Ryan Nobles,"May 26, 2023, 7:51 PM UTC",Russia Investigation,"The House Judiciary Committee will hear public testimony from former special counsel John Durham about his probe into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation on June 21, two sources familiar with the committee’s plans told NBC news. Durham was charged by former U.S. Attorney General William Barr with leading a probe into the FBI and Justice Department’s handling of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election —an investigation Barr had been highly critical of. Durham completed his four-year investigation and filed a lengthy final report earlier this month that concluded the FBI inappropriately launched a full investigation into the allegations, but stopped short of providing any new evidence that anyone in the government had broken the law. “The [Justice] Department and the FBI failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to law,” Durham’s report said. “Senior FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor toward the information they received, especially information received from politically affiliated persons or entities.” The Justice Department’s inspector general, however, found in 2019 that despite a series of mistakes by the FBI, the decision to open the probe was justified and not tainted by political bias or improper motivation. In response to Durham's report, the FBI said it had already addressed the missteps he had identified. “The conduct in 2016 and 2017 that Special Counsel Durham examined was the reason that current FBI leadership already implemented dozens of corrective actions, which have now been in place for some time,” it said in a statement. Over the course of his investigation, Durham elicited one guilty plea that led to probation charge, but also fell short of convicting defendants in two trials. Republicans, including Judiciary chair Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, have used Durham’s report to make the case that the probe into Russia and its ties to then-candidate Donald Trump were politically motivated and based on a faulty premise. Fox News reported last week that Jordan planned to call Durham to testify before the committee. House Democrats have charged that the Durham report itself is politically motivated. Durham ""is the number one example of the weaponization of the federal government,” Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., told MSNBC last week. "
Pentagon police step up security and searches after Jack Teixeira's arrest in leaked documents case,Courtney Kube,"May 26, 2023, 5:49 PM UTC",National Security,"The Pentagon's police force has increased security measures to ensure classified information is not being taken out, including random screenings as personnel and guests leave. The screenings include uniformed officers checking bags. The new measures come after Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira was arrested, accused of leaking a trove of classified military documents in an online forum. A Pentagon spokesperson said screening as people come and go is not new, but confirmed enhanced screenings in light of a memo from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about protecting classified information. “The Pentagon Force Protection Agency routinely screens employees entering and exiting the Pentagon for prohibited items and to ensure classified information is protected and handled in accordance with current security requirements. PFPA has increased these security screenings and measures in response to the immediate review of information security procedures directed by Secretary of Defense Austin on April 17, 2023,” Defense Department spokesperson Sue Gough said in a statement. Individual U.S. military bases have also stepped up security and searches for classified material since Teixeira’s arrest, officials said, though such measures are up to the discretion of base commanders. Teixeira, who had a top-secret security clearance, was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard and was stationed at Otis Air National Guard Base. He was arrested by the FBI at his home in April. He was charged under the Espionage Act and is being held without bail. "
DeSantis signs Florida bill limiting the liabilities of private spaceflight companies,Denise Chow,"May 26, 2023, 3:45 PM UTC",Space,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday signed into law a spaceflight bill that protects companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin from legal liability if crewmembers or passengers are injured or killed during missions. The Spaceflight Entity Liability bill, or CS/SB 1318, was one of 27 bills he signed a day after launching his campaign for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination during an event on Twitter with its owner, Elon Musk, who is also the CEO of SpaceX. The new law effectively shields SpaceX and other commercial space companies from lawsuits in the event that anyone on their rockets or capsules are seriously hurt or killed. The bill now requires crewmembers and passengers to acknowledge the risks of spaceflight by signing a waiver that contains the following statement: “WARNING: Under Florida law, there is no liability for an injury to or death of a participant or crew in a spaceflight activity provided by a spaceflight entity if such injury or death results from the spaceflight activity.” Injuries may include damage to land, people, equipment and animals, in addition to “the potential for you to act in a negligent manner that may contribute to your injury or death,” according to the bill. An analysis of the bill by the Florida Senate found that it “has the potential to limit the cost of litigation to businesses engaging in spaceflight activities.” Florida’s “Space Coast,” or the area around NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, has been a hot  spot of commercial space activity, as companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin look to expand launch services for both the government and the private sector. Aerospace activities contribute about $17.7 billion in revenue to Florida’s economy, according to Space Florida, a government agency that aims to promote aerospace economic development across the state. The Spaceflight Entity Liability bill was sponsored by Republican Sen. Tom Wright, and passed unanimously in the state Senate and with little debate in the Florida House. "
House Democratic angst grows as Biden's debt limit negotiations with GOP drag on,Sahil Kapur,"May 24, 2023, 4:18 PM UTC / Updated May 26, 2023, 3:33 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — House Democratic anxieties are flaring over President Joe Biden's negotiations with Republicans to avert default. Some Democrats fear his limited public statements on the debt ceiling amount to ceding the messaging war to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and his deputies, who have been ubiquitous in recent days in casting blame on the White House. Other Democrats say Biden is wrong to discredit the 14th Amendment option to tackle the debt limit unilaterally, as the GOP engages in what Democrats see as a hostage standoff. Ultimately, their angst is about whom the public will blame if a deal can't be reached, or if the terms of any agreement are draconian. Without a more aggressive effort to talk to the public, Democrats worry that voters will focus their anger on Biden — and them. Follow along for live updates One House Democratic lawmaker said the White House needs to do a better job harnessing ""the levers of communication of the presidency, which they haven’t effectively utilized up to this point."" ""The president needs to fully utilize the bully pulpit, the power of the presidency, to get the message across to the American people what’s really at stake here. As of this time, the American people haven’t been fully informed what is truly at stake by what default means for this country,"" the lawmaker said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to candidly critique the president. “This is one where there’s no substitute for the president of the United States,"" the lawmaker added. Democratic hand-wringing about Biden is nothing new, but it comes at a critical moment for a president who just launched his bid for a second term. Negotiations with McCarthy's team have sputtered, and there are just eight days left before the Treasury Department says the U.S. could run out of money and default on its debt. Part of the reason for anxiety on Capitol Hill is that many Democrats are not dialed into the back and forth of the talks. Another House Democrat, who represents a swing district, lamented that Biden and the White House have only talked in front of the television cameras about raising the debt ceiling, but haven’t pressed their case for cutting future spending — an issue that plays well in competitive districts like the one the moderate represents. “It does seem to me like Republicans are beating us to the message at this point,” the source continued. “The White House needs to recognize that its message is not getting through and take some pretty swift and decisive action to get out there and make sure that more people are hearing that message.” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said Biden could pay a price with progressive voters — who turned out in big numbers and were instrumental to his narrow electoral college win in 2020 — if he cuts a budget deal that allows Republicans to target the left's priorities. “The president — I’m sure he’s thinking about the fact that it was a very vibrant, diverse coalition that put them in the White House, and he’s going to need that vibrant, diverse coalition again for 2024,” the Progressive Caucus chair said, warning about “the impact of taking a bad deal and allowing Republicans to put forward these absolutely unreasonable positions.” “I’ve been very supportive of his leadership over the last few years. Everything that we got done was done because of a partnership and trust and respect between the White House and and the Democratic caucus, including the progressive base,” she said. “So, I think he just needs to remember that because I think the backlash will be significant if somehow we were to get bullied into a bad deal. I think it’s very bad for the people of America; I also think it’s a terrible dynamic for negotiations going forward.” Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., said the president should remember ""those that have been supportive of him and have been pushing his agenda,"" as well as reach out to the ""huge numbers"" of young people who weren't yet 18 in 2020 but can vote now. She warned that it's ""not going to be helpful"" to Biden's re-election coalition in 2024 if he strikes a deal with McCarthy that slashes domestic funding on things like education programs. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a Biden ally and leadership member, said the president should “negotiate, negotiate, negotiate” and then use the 14th Amendment to pay the bills unilaterally if time runs out. It's an option many progressives have pushed Biden to use. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday the president has been clear and outspoken on the issue for months. “You’ve heard from the president multiple times during the last five months. He’s been very clear,” she said. “You’ve heard from the president; you’ve heard from the economic team; you’ve heard from Democrats, the leadership in the House, in the Senate talk — speak to this about the urgency, about Congress actually needing to act and doing their constitutional duty.” Biden’s press secretary was quick to embrace a sharper message by congressional Democrats on Tuesday, telling reporters that Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., was speaking for the party when he attacked “MAGA” Republicans over debt limit “gamesmanship.” Asked if Jeffries was undermining the president’s work to reach a deal, Jean-Pierre responded that the two sides were “aligned” and had been for months. Filling the messaging void, Jeffries on Wednesday will hold his third news conference in three days about the debt crisis. A new Monmouth poll released Wednesday found that 34% approve of Biden's handling of the debt limit, while 32% approve of the way Democrats in Congress have handled it, and just 29% approve of how Republicans in Congress have handled it. Meanwhile, a Marist poll found that 45% of U.S. adults would primarily blame Republicans for a default, while 43% would primarily blame Biden. The White House has seemed uncertain about how to deploy Vice President Kamala Harris. During the debt ceiling fight in 2011, then-Vice President Biden was tapped by Barack Obama to help negotiate a deal. Harris, herself a former senator, has not played nearly as prominent a role. Last week, she joined Biden in the Oval Office for a meeting with congressional leaders — a sign that she might be getting more publicly involved. But when Biden later went to Hiroshima, Japan, for a Group of Seven summit, Harris did not appear to be publicly engaged on the issue. At one point, she left town and flew to Los Angeles where she toured a nonprofit warehouse that distributes supplies to families and also watched Brittney Griner's return to the WNBA. At a press briefing in Hiroshima on Saturday, Jean-Pierre was asked why Harris wasn’t in the Capitol joining in the negotiations. “She has been in regular conversations as well and has been in conversations with the president,” Jean-Pierre said. “He has taken her consult and listened to her advice, as he always does on many issues.” For many House Democrats, the main frustration is with McCarthy and Republicans for taking compromises off the table — such as new tax revenues and cuts to military spending — which leaves little else to cut other than domestic discretionary spending. He has rejected a spending freeze that would amount to an inflation-adjusted cut. “Kevin McCarthy has more red lines than Crayola,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. Biden was side by side with McCarthy on Monday at the White House when the president said revenue-raising measures needed to be part of the conversation, even as he said spending needed to be cut. “We should be looking at tax loopholes and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share,” Biden said. Asked Wednesday why he isn’t offering Democrats any concessions for lifting the debt ceiling, McCarthy said the Republican-pushed spending caps and tougher work requirements for federal benefits were the concessions. “If AOC and Bernie Sanders is going to run their party, that’s not my fault,” he told reporters, referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the third-ranked House Democrat and an appropriator, said it’s mathematically impossible to meet all of McCarthy’s demands and protect funding for veterans. “It makes it increasingly difficult to reach the budget numbers that he wants to reach,” Aguilar said. “It’s going to lead to over 30% cuts to everything else from Head Start to Meals on Wheels.” "
What will happen if the U.S. hits the debt ceiling?,Shannon Pettypiece,"May 25, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC / Updated May 26, 2023, 3:32 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — With congressional leaders seemingly at a stalemate over a deal to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, the risks are growing that the U.S. could run out of money to pay all its bills by as early as next week — putting the country in uncharted waters as to what happens next. The debt ceiling refers to a law that caps the total amount of federal debt allowed to be outstanding. The U.S. hit that limit in January, but the Treasury Department says it has been using workarounds, or what it calls “extraordinary measures,” to keep the government paying its bills on time. But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says those efforts will be exhausted in the coming week and the U.S. could run out of money to meet all its obligations as soon as June 1. The Treasury Department doesn't know the exact date, since there is a constant flow of money coming in and out of the federal coffers, but Goldman Sachs projects the date could be closer to June 8 or 9, and the Bipartisan Policy Groups says the date is likely between June 2 and 13. Follow along for live updates Regardless of the exact date, without legislative action, the U.S. is days away from not being able to pay all of its bills, something that has never happened before. Like anyone facing a budget crunch, Yellen will have to determine who gets paid and when — until the country gets another influx of tax payments expected in mid-June, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Those payments could keep the federal government cash positive until mid-July. Yellen hasn’t given many details on what specifically would happen once the country’s bills outstrip its revenues, but economists and former government officials have some theories on who might get paid and how. Debt holders first in line? One option for Yellen would be to pay bondholders the interest they are owed on U.S. Treasuries first and delay paying all other bills, like Social Security and veterans benefits, until the government has enough money to do so, said economists and budget policy experts. That was a strategy Treasury officials said they had gamed out in 2011 when the U.S. came close to default back then. Failing to pay bondholders would likely have the biggest repercussions across the economy because of the chaos it would create in the financial markets, since Treasuries are seen as one of the safest investments in the world. A failure to make those payments would almost certainly trigger a downgrading of the U.S. credit rating, making it more expensive for the government to borrow money and driving up interest rates for anyone else looking to borrow money for a home, car or with a credit card, said economists.  It would also cause banks to significantly pull back on lending, cutting off lines of credit to businesses that need to borrow money for everything from an expansion to making that month’s payroll. The value of the dollar would also be affected, having an impact on companies that buy or sell goods overseas. But even if the U.S. doesn’t default on its debt payments, the risk of coming so close and not being able to make other payments could be enough for the rating agencies to downgrade the U.S. credit rating, as in 2011 when S&P downgraded the U.S. when it came perilously close to a default. Giving priority to bondholder payments could also come with political consequences for the Biden administration if it’s viewed as investors getting paid while others, like Social Security recipients, miss getting their checks on time. “Politically it is a disaster because you are effectively paying a Chinese bondholder before you are paying someone’s Social Security payment,” said Stephen Myrow, a managing partner of Beacon Policy Advisors, who worked in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. Delay in government payments Prioritizing payments outside of what’s due to debt holders gets more complicated since picking and choosing which of the thousands of bills get paid would be a politically, logistically and legally fraught endeavor for Yellen and President Joe Biden. Yellen has said that the Treasury isn’t set up to do it and that failure to meet any payments — whether to debt holders or veterans —  would be considered a default. Given the payment system the federal government uses, it might not even be logistically feasible at this point to issue some payments, such as to Social Security recipients, and not to others, such as federal workers, said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. If some groups got paid and others didn't, it could also open the administration to legal challenges. As an alternative, policy experts expect Yellen would hold off on paying all other bills until the U.S. has enough revenue in its accounts to pay all the bills at once. That could mean a delay of several days for those expecting government benefits, which are scheduled to go out for some beneficiaries on June 2. The longer the impasse goes on, the longer the delay would become. “We assume that the U.S. Treasury would continue to make principal and interest payments on time, but they would postpone making noninterest payments until they had enough money in the checking account to be able to pay all of that day's noninterest obligations all in one fell swoop, not prioritizing them and making sure they had enough money to make interest payments,” said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The delay in payments would likely be relatively short-lived because the U.S. is set to get an influx of tax payments on June 15, which could provide enough cash to get the country through July before it once again runs into a cash crunch, Akabas said. A much bigger disruption, though, would likely come from the physiological effects of the U.S. not being able to pay all its bills. Stocks could drop 20% in that scenario, similar to declines seen during the financial crisis of 2008, according to a report from UBS. What's the difference between a default and a shutdown? A debt ceiling breach would look different from a government shutdown in a number of ways and would come with much greater consequences for the economy than a shutdown, which the U.S. has been through numerous times in recent years. “We know what a government shutdown looks like, we have been there before, it doesn’t look pretty but it also isn’t catastrophic,” said Akabas. “With the debt limit it is totally uncharted territory and we could see ramifications that would affect every American household.” A government shutdown is triggered when Congress fails to pass legislation to fund the government. As a result, federal workers aren’t paid, nonessential workers stay home and certain services that receive federal funding, such as the National Parks, are closed. But mandatory programs, like Medicare and Social Security, aren't affected. But in the case of a debt ceiling breach, all federal spending is affected, including Medicare payments, Social Security checks and veterans benefits. Federal workers would likely still be required to report to work, but may not get paid on time. Coins and the 14th Amendment Several workarounds have been proposed by economists and former policymakers, but Yellen and other top administration officials have largely ruled those out. One proposal has been the minting of a $1 trillion platinum coin by the U.S. Mint that the Treasury could deposit with the Federal Reserve. A law from the 1990s gives the mint the authority to produce coins in any denomination, but Yellen has called the move a “gimmick” and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated he wouldn’t accept the coin. The Treasury could also reissue bonds, putting old bonds up for auction with a higher rate, which would help to bring in additional money without adding debt. But economists said this new form of debt could create chaos in the financial markets that could be as bad as what would be seen from a default. Another proposal has been for Biden to invoke the 14th Amendment that says the “validity of the public debt shall not be questioned,” which some have interpreted as saying the debt ceiling is unconstitutional. Under that interpretation, the U.S. can continue issuing debt to raise money, assuming investors are willing to buy it and confident it would be held up in court. Biden said he has considered invoking the 14th Amendment but acknowledged it would likely end up in court — essentially causing a default while the move is litigated. Another option would involve action by Congress. If House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is unwilling to bring a bill to raise the debt ceiling to the floor without the funding cuts Republicans demand and Democrats oppose, a majority of members could bring it to the floor themselves. It's unlikely there is enough support for this so-called discharge petition option or time given the lengthy process involved. Even if one of those proposals was acted upon, it still doesn’t get around the larger psychological effects that would occur in the global financial markets if the U.S. were in a position where it couldn’t pay all its bills, said Edelberg. “All these workarounds people are thinking of, those don’t solve the basic problem that in the aftermath you will have all this consternation because holy smokes we can’t’ even do this basic level of governing and in the meantime it’s all up to the court to determine if some Treasuries issued were illegally issued,” said Edelberg. “None of these workarounds avoid the worst of the problem.” "
Ron DeSantis says he would consider presidential pardons for Jan. 6 rioters,Rose Horowitch,"May 26, 2023, 3:28 PM UTC",2024 Election,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who officially stepped into the presidential race this week, said Thursday that, if elected, he would consider pardoning people involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol — possibly including his rival for the GOP nomination, former President Donald Trump. DeSantis has consistently polled second to Trump in national surveys and has sought to draw a contrast with the former president while being reluctant to attack him outright. In an appearance on ""The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show,"" a conservative talk radio show, DeSantis said that on ""Day One"" of his presidency he would have his staff examine cases of Jan. 6 rioters, pro-life demonstrators and parents arrested over their actions at school board meetings, and would be ""aggressive"" in issuing pardons. ""We will use the pardon power — and I will do that at the front end,"" DeSantis said, claiming that the Justice Department and the FBI had been ""weaponized"" to unevenly punish people from ""disfavored groups."" When asked whether he would consider pardoning Trump if he were charged with federal offenses, DeSantis responded that ""any example of disfavored treatment based on politics or weaponization would be included in that review, no matter how small or how big."" A Trump campaign spokesman didn't respond specifically to a  request for comment on DeSantis' remarks. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung instead pointed to an NBC News report that DeSantis administration officials have solicited campaign contributions from Florida lobbyists — a breach of traditional norms that raises ethical and legal questions — and called the Florida governor ""the 2024 version of Crooked Hillary."" DeSantis’ office did not return a request for comment on the campaign solicitations. On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of Joe Biden's presidential win. The siege and its aftermath resulted in five people dead and about 140 members of law enforcement injured. More than 1,000 people involved in the attack have been arrested, with more than 480 sentenced. Hundreds of additional Jan. 6 rioters have been identified but not yet charged. Throughout his candidacy, Trump has praised the rioters, many of them convicted of violent crimes. Earlier this month, Trump said he would pardon a ""large portion"" of the people convicted of federal offenses for their roles in the riot. “I am inclined to pardon many of them,” Trump said at a town hall hosted by CNN at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. “I can’t say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.” A special counsel is investigating Trump for his actions related to the Jan. 6 attack, though no charges have been announced. In March, Trump was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on charges of falsifying business records around hush money given toward the end of his 2016 campaign to a woman he allegedly had an affair with, which the Manhattan district attorney said violated state law and exceeded the federal campaign contribution cap. Trump has repeatedly denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the Manhattan district attorney's charges. Earlier this month, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in a civil trial, which is not subject to a presidential pardon — a constitutional power that applies only to federal crimes. Still, some Republican candidates have publicly pledged to pardon Trump if they are elected president. Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy promised to pardon Trump on his first day in office should he be elected president. Republican candidate Perry Johnson said the same. "
Republicans brace for 2022 losers to take another crack at winning,Allan Smith,"May 26, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",2024 Election,"In the 2022 midterms, a number of far-right candidates cruised to primary victories with former President Donald Trump’s backing — only to blow key races with a general electorate who viewed them as too extreme. And now, Republicans are nervously bracing for many of them to run again. At least four of these candidates who ran, and lost, in 2022 are making it known that they’re interested in running again in 2024 — or have already announced bids. They’re testing the party’s commitment this cycle to emphasize “candidate quality” and offering Democrats a sliver of hope as they navigate a difficult Senate map and a narrow field of swing House races. Jim Marchant, the failed GOP secretary of state nominee in Nevada, recently launched his campaign to challenge a Democratic Senate incumbent. Kari Lake, who narrowly lost her gubernatorial bid in Arizona last fall and continues to lose her court battles challenging the results, is on the verge of joining him in a Senate bid for 2024. Many party leaders breathed a sigh of relief Thursday night when Doug Mastriano, a far-right state senator in Pennsylvania who decisively lost his race for governor last year, announced he would not be launching a Senate campaign. But at the House level, Republicans Joe Kent in Washington and J.R. Majewski in Ohio — two MAGA-aligned candidates who hugged Trump tightly but fell short in districts Republicans were favored in — have already launched their next bids. Others may soon join. All of these candidates put Trump’s false claims of a stolen election front and center in their campaigns, helping them get through contested primaries but putting them at a disadvantage with independents in the general election. Their defeats have led some party leaders to suggest they may take a more active role in the primary process. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told NBC News in an interview last month that Republicans need to appeal to voters “beyond the Republican base” in order to pull off victories next fall — something he said will in part rely on campaigning on “the future, not looking at the rearview or the past.” “Winning elections is about addition and multiplication, not subtraction and division,” he said. “And so that’s something that every candidate got to look in the mirror and say, 'Am I a candidate that can first bring the Republican base together and also extend an appeal to independent voters?' That’s the recipe.” Recently, Lake met with Daines and six other Republican senators to discuss her potential Senate bid, a national Republican strategist said. Daines said he has asked prospective candidates to share with him a plan for how they can win both a primary and a general election. Daines, who endorsed Trump last month, believes the former president will be helpful with whom he backs or does not support in primaries. But last year, it was Trump who helped elevate many of these candidates through contested primaries with his sought-after endorsement. Trump’s campaign did not answer requests for comment about whether he would be supportive of some of these same candidates this time around. Terry Sullivan, who was campaign manager for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign, said that while many candidates do improve during a second run, there were “a lot of really crappy candidates last time.” “And if you’re just a fundamentally flawed candidate the first time you run, you’re still a fundamentally flawed candidate the second time you run,” he said, adding, “You’ve always had the weirdo candidates that run no matter what. And the difference now is, they’re kind of given more oxygen than they ever did in the past, and they’re actually winning primaries.” If anything, what has Republicans most concerned about some of these candidates is, as Daines put it, an insistence on relitigating the 2020 (and perhaps 2022) elections. That seems unlikely to change. For example, Lake on Tuesday announced she would petition the Supreme Court to hear her latest case seeking to invalidate her 2022 defeat at the hands of Katie Hobbs, then-Democratic Arizona secretary of state. “I think if Kari could recalibrate her message away from the stolen election claims, she’s got enough raw political talent to make that race competitive,” the national Republican strategist said. But that was not transferable to other 2022 losers seeking Senate seats this cycle. “No,” this person said. “I think that’s Kari Lake-specific.” In a statement, Lake said: “Electing Republicans up and down the ballot is undoubtedly what is needed to save our great Nation,” adding a request to “Stay tuned” for a “major” announcement within weeks. Marchant did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats have mostly stayed quiet on the developing GOP primary field, but outside groups have left the doors open to boosting more extreme candidates they see as easier to beat, just as some Democrats did last cycle. In Nevada, Democrats have already started to take aim at Marchant, highlighting comments he made on a webcast earlier this year that seemed to endorse the military intervening in the 2024 vote. “There’s never been a larger gap between what kind of candidates Republican primary voters demand and the kinds of candidates general election voters will accept,” Democratic strategist Rich Luchette said. “Republicans underperformed in the midterms because they nominated people who want to restrict reproductive rights for women, cut Medicare and Medicaid, and support right-wing political violence, including the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Among competitive House races, few frustrated Republicans more than the battle last year in Toledo, Ohio, where long-entrenched Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur was seen as vulnerable in a 9th Congressional District redrawn to be friendlier to the GOP. Majewski — an Air Force veteran who, before winning his party’s nomination, was best known for painting a Trump banner on his lawn — lost to Kaptur by 13 points, his campaign scuttled by an Associated Press report that he had misrepresented his military service. Others on the ground in the district complained about what they saw as a lazy and undisciplined campaign that failed to activate grassroots voters and take advantage of Kaptur’s weaknesses. Undeterred, Majewski is angling for a rematch in 2024. GOP leaders in Ohio and nationally worry about a scenario in which his recent familiarity with voters carries him out of a crowded primary and prevents them from picking up a winnable seat. “I can stomach a MAGA candidate that can win if they do something right, if they bring something to the table to help them get elected,” said one unaffiliated Republican official in the Ohio 9th District who requested anonymity to speak candidly. This person added a Majewski nomination “unquestionably” locks in a GOP loss. Another Republican operative involved in races across Ohio quipped that it’s time for Majewski to “repaint the lawn, not re-announce a campaign.” Majewski did not respond to a request for comment. In Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, Kent, who promoted Trump’s false claims of a stolen election and expressed skepticism over the integrity of the vote count in his own race as ballots were being tallied, believes 2024 will prove much more favorable for him than did his last bid. (He ultimately conceded and accepted the results.) Kent was able to defeat then-Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash., in a primary last year after she voted to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, only to lose against Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in a district that tilts toward the right. In a recent memo provided to NBC News, Kent’s campaign argued that his 2022 loss was due to him being widely outspent during the primary and because his general election opponent did not yet have a record in Congress he could run against. This time, he has no incumbent to face in a primary and can go on the offense against a Democratic rival who has a record “to expose,” the memo said. “Every hurdle I faced in 2022 has been removed for 2024: running against a same-party incumbent, facing a barrage of establishment-backed attack ads in the primary, lacking funding from the DC Republicans in the General Election, depressed rural Republican voter turnout, and a Democrat opponent that didn’t then have the radical voting record she has now,” Kent said via email. He added his narrow defeat was well within the typical rightward swing the district takes in presidential years. “We have great reason to be optimistic about 2024,” he said. That’s not the only thing about the presidential cycle that could work in some of these candidates’ favor. As Sullivan said, a presidential cycle means way more reporters will be focused on Des Moines and Manchester, New Hampshire, rather than on Pittsburgh and Phoenix. “You’re going to have a lot less media scrutiny across the board,” he said. “It’s fundamentally different how it’ll be covered.” "
Gusher of cash reshapes GOP presidential contest,Ben Kamisar,"May 26, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",2024 Election,"The 2024 presidential election is just getting started — and the campaign is already raging at a faster, louder and pricier pace than ever. Republican candidates and groups have already spent almost $30 million on ads in the party's primary this year, according to data from the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. When they cross that threshold Saturday, that'll be 50 days earlier than Democrats hit that spending mark during their open presidential primary four years ago, and a full 137 days earlier than it took Republicans to cross the $30 million threshold during their last open presidential race, in October 2015. The bulk of the spending is coming from super PACs, with former President Donald Trump’s MAGA Inc. spending to blast Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and DeSantis’ Never Back Down PAC running positive spots. And the accelerated pace underlines key dynamics shaping the Republican race for the White House. Super PACs and megadonors are playing a bigger role than ever. Candidates have been taking advantage of loose campaign finance laws to prepare for this race — and sock away money to use or send to allies — for years before announcing campaigns. Most of all, the competition between Trump and DeSantis promises to be an all-out brawl like nothing seen before. “It’s a very competitive race on the Republican side to be the challenger to Trump — the dynamics are just different than they were in 2016,” said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist who served as communications director for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. ""This time, Trump is trying to eliminate some of his competition early, the ‘kill them in the crib’ strategy,"" Conant continued. ""And some of the would-be challengers are trying to establish that they belong."" The pace in the 2024 GOP primary is a massive escalation from the last time Republicans had an open presidential primary. Ahead of 2016, the first dollar wasn't spent on ads until April 3, 2015. Spending hit $1 million in June, $10 million in August, $20 million in late September and $30 million in October. This year, Republican presidential ad spending hit the $1 million mark on March 25, $10 million in late April, $20 million in early May and is expected to hit $30 million on May 27. ""Inflation exists in politics too,"" Conant said. ""It's increasingly expensive to reach voters, but it’s also easier to raise money than it used to be."" Indeed, DeSantis enters the 2024 race already boasting the support of a $20 million donor: hotel magnate Robert Bigelow, per Time magazine. It could end up being the biggest super PAC donation ever in a presidential primary — except that tech billionaire Larry Ellison has given $35 million to a super PAC aligned with Sen. Tim Scott in recent years and is set to pump yet more into 2024. In terms of candidates officially announcing campaigns, the primary is just beginning, but those examples illustrate how the competition has really been underway for months or even years. Before launching his bid, Trump seeded his super PAC with tens of millions of dollars raised by one of his fundraising committees, largely from small-dollar donors, in 2021 and 2022. DeSantis appears poised to bolster his super PAC with more than $80 million that was largely raised while he was running for re-election in Florida. It's not just Trump and DeSantis, either. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley incubated a small-donor list in her political nonprofit for years before saying the words, ""I'm running for president."" Scott built up nearly $22 million in his Senate campaign account, all of it transferable to a presidential campaign, before officially starting his 2024 bid with launch plans that included a multimillion-dollar ad buy. All of the pre-planning helps explain why the presidential campaign has been able to accelerate so quickly compared to the last two. Candidates who can only raise a few thousand dollars maximum from each donor need time to build up funds, and the Democratic presidential field in 2020 was super PAC-averse. The ad war hadn’t really started by this point in the 2016 GOP race, either. The top spender in late May 2015 was a nonprofit, Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, which had spent under $400,000 attacking Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul. But much of the early 2024 spending has its roots in tactics that were field-tested in past campaigns, as politicians and political operatives explored the loosely defined boundaries of campaign finance law. Former Florida GOP Gov. Jeb Bush revolutionized presidential campaign fundraising in 2015 with a novel strategy: Before officially announcing he was a candidate, he raised $100 million into a super PAC that would go on to support his bid. Now, pre-raising super PAC funds has become a regular feature of campaigns, despite questions about whether the strategy adheres to the spirit of the law restricting how much candidates can raise from donors. Former business executive Carly Fiorina’s campaign outsourced much of its campaign operation to a super PAC supporting her candidacy. This election cycle, DeSantis’ campaign is expected to begin with more than enough resources, but Never Back Down is signaling its intention to build out a grassroots organization — traditionally the purview of the campaign proper — to augment the campaign’s operations. The maturation of these strategies meant Trump's and DeSantis' teams were ready to do battle right away this year. And it's not going to slow down anytime soon. "
Doug Mastriano will not run for Senate in Pennsylvania in 2024,Allan Smith,"May 26, 2023, 1:20 AM UTC",Congress,"Doug Mastriano, the far-right state senator who was blown out in Pennsylvania's gubernatorial contest last fall, announced Thursday that he will not run for Senate in 2024. ""At this time we have decided not to run for Senate, but to continue to serve in Harrisburg,"" Mastriano said in a video posted on Facebook Thursday. ""So I know for some, that’ll be disappointing. For others, it won’t be disappointing, because you’re like, ‘Who’s going to fill his seat? Who’s going to be our voice in Harrisburg?’ … Whoever is that nominee, I will support them,"" he added. Mastriano had been openly considering a Senate bid, much to the consternation of some party leaders who didn't want a repeat of the losses in 2022. Republicans are trying to knock off Sen. Bob Casey, whose re-election bid in the battleground state will play a key role in Democrats' effort to keep their slim majority in the Senate next year. Many Republicans are looking to Dave McCormick, a businessman who narrowly lost a GOP Senate primary last year to celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz. After Mastriano's announcement, McCormick put out a statement saying he was still keeping the door open to running. ""I am seriously considering a run for the U.S. Senate because Bob Casey has consistently made life worse for Pennsylvania families over the past 18 years, and our state deserves better,"" he said. Mastriano was first elected to the state Senate in 2019 but only rose to prominence after the 2020 election when former President Donald Trump sought allies in state Legislatures to help him reverse his loss. On Jan. 6, 2021, Mastriano was outside the Capitol as pro-Trump stormed Congress in hopes of keeping the then-president in office, though Mastriano said he did not go inside the building. His state Senate campaign had also paid to bus people to the rally that preceded the riot. Mastriano, a former Army colonel, sought to take advantage of his rising profile and launched a bid for governor, during which he emerged victorious over a deep primary field, aided at the finish line by Trump's endorsement. Throughout his run, Mastriano centered culture-war issues and wove themes of Christian nationalism into his campaign. He also took a hardline stance against abortion rights. (In 2019, he said that women who violated a proposed six-week ban should be charged with murder, NBC News reported.) Democrat Josh Shapiro, then the state attorney general, was able to capitalize on Mastriano's history and positions, framing him as the most extreme candidate running nationwide last fall and soaring to a more than 14-point win that was the largest margin of victory for any nonincumbent governor in Pennsylvania since 1946.

Will Chinese hacking derail U.S. hopes for a thaw with Beijing?,Andrea Mitchell,"May 26, 2023, 1:18 AM UTC",National Security,"The State Department is warning of a new type of malware it says a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group has been trying to insert into the computer systems of critical infrastructure across the United States, including Guam. The presence of the suspicious computer code was announced Wednesday by Microsoft in a warning it issued to private sector users of its software. The U.S. territory of Guam is the location of a critical Marine base that would respond to China if it attacked Taiwan. The National Security Agency also issued an alert to electrical utilities, nuclear power stations, water systems, railways and other key sectors that could be vulnerable. “The U.S. intelligence community assesses that China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that can disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters Thursday. “It’s vital for government network defenders in the public to stay vigilant.” The news comes as U.S. and Chinese officials are holding their first Cabinet-level meetings in Washington during the Biden administration, with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo meeting with her counterpart, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. U.S. officials said that the two had “candid and substantive discussions” Thursday and that Raimondo ""raised concerns"" about recent government actions against U.S. companies operating in China. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was also scheduled to meet with Wang. They will both also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, commonly known as APEC, in Detroit on Friday and Saturday along with ministers from other countries in those regions. Asked whether the new malware could affect the economic talks, Miller said, “We do intend to use our conversations with the Chinese government to press on areas where we have concerns.” Before leaving a summit of leading industrial nations in Japan on Sunday, President Joe Biden expressed optimism that the U.S. and China would soon be able to improve bilateral relations. Tensions heightened after the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon in early February off the South Carolina coast after it crossed the country from Montana to the Atlantic coast. China has maintained it was a weather balloon that had blown off course, repeating that claim most recently in meetings national security adviser Jake Sullivan held with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang two weeks ago in Vienna. China had earlier halted regular military communications with the Pentagon to protest then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan last September. A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the two meetings with the Chinese officials in Washington could bolster Biden’s push for a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. The official suggested that a trip to China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken that was canceled after the balloon was shot down could be rescheduled by August, as well as visits by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Raimondo and climate envoy John Kerry. But China’s Foreign Ministry reacted harshly to the hacking accusation Thursday, accusing the U.S. of working with its allies to launch a coordinated disinformation campaign. “We noted this extremely unprofessional report, a patchwork with a broken chain of evidence,” ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “We also noted that the U.S. National Security Agency and the cybersecurity agencies of the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand, almost simultaneously issued similar reports.” Another negative signal came when China’s newly appointed ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, said on arrival Tuesday that “the relationship is faced with serious difficulties and challenges.” On Thursday, Feng met with Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, at the State Department. Nuland tweeted a photograph of herself shaking hands with the new Chinese envoy and tried to strike an optimistic note about easing tensions, writing, “Open dialogue is critical to managing our relationship.” "
"After flubbed Twitter rollout, DeSantis' team talks strategy with donors",Natasha Korecki,"May 25, 2023, 7:58 PM UTC / Updated May 26, 2023, 12:18 AM UTC",2024 Election,"MIAMI — Undeterred by the glitch-filled launch that left some of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' supporters acknowledging it was a flop, the newly-minted campaign team spent Thursday briefing supporters and detailing their strategy to defeat former President Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary. The summit with donors in Miami was a chance for DeSantis strategists to lay out their vision for the next year and try to build enthusiasm that their tactic will boost the Florida governor past Trump, who they're banking on also being dragged down by his legal woes, according to interviews with several attendees. DeSantis’ campaign on Thursday said it raised $8.2 million in the first 24 hours after the launch. DeSantis launched his bid Wednesday night with Elon Musk on Twitter Spaces, a platform for audio chats that became overwhelmed as hundreds of thousands of people tuned in. As a result, the early stages of the event included hosts at times openly lamenting the tech failure. “We have got so many people here that we are kind of melting the servers,” David Sacks, a tech entrepreneur who is a longtime friend of Musk and political supporter of DeSantis, said during the glitch-filled early stages of the event. The stops-and-starts, including a struggle to get Musk and DeSantis into the virtual event, gave ammunition to his chief rival, former President Donald Trump, and a cringe moment for his supporters. One Florida veteran Republican operative quipped: ""It’s rare that something is so awful that in the middle of it you know you’re witnessing a moment in history that will be both punchline and cautionary tale for decades, but DeSantis achieved dubious distinction tonight."" Another called it a ""colossal f--- up."" A third person close to the DeSantis political operation bemoaned that the operation had failed the Florida governor. “I think Governor DeSantis deserves a campaign worthy of his candidacy. And I think failure is one thing, but completely predictable failure is another,” the third person said. The source also said there was concern internally about the unconventional launch plan; not everyone on Team DeSantis was on board with the idea. Some thought it was too risky and the campaign should have opted for a more traditional, controlled rollout. Some of that split appeared evident in the messaging aftermath. The Never Back Down, the super PAC supporting DeSantis is not mimicking the “breaking the internet” language and is instead pushing that they knocked the 30,000 doors in Iowa yesterday and started door-knocking efforts in New Hampshire. It’s rare that something is so awful that in the middle of it you know you’re witnessing a moment in history that will be both punchline and cautionary tale for decades, but DeSantis achieved dubious distinction tonight. A veteran Republican operative DeSantis, meanwhile, tried to spin the event as a positive, noting the huge audience and for the event that grabbed international headlines, even if not for all the right reasons. “It was probably the biggest story in the world yesterday,” DeSantis said Thursday on Erick Erickson’s radio show, the same day the world watched Washington try to negotiate a debt ceiling deal and musical legend Tina Turner died. The launch came as key donors and supporters met Wednesday and Thursday at the Four Seasons hotel in Miami to begin raising money for the campaign and get their marching orders from top DeSantis advisers. Among those attending the event — which was part networking cocktail party and part serious listening session — were former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who narrowly lost a bid for U.S. Senate in 2022, and Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, according to three people who were there. Several donors who talked to NBC News insisted that they didn’t see the Twitter glitch as a debacle. Instead, they saw the crash as a sign of interest in DeSantis and blamed the platform and Musk, not the campaign. “There was no hand-wringing … it was like ‘he broke the internet. There were cheers, that sort of thing,” said one of the bundlers in the room. The person did, however, admit that “after a few minutes, it was like, ‘what is this? Let’s fix this.’” “I think initially it was like, 'oh it crashed.' I think it was received as there’s so much interest in the campaign, it broke the platform,” said another donor. “It felt like a ton of energy.” DeSantis’ senior campaign staff delivered an afternoon presentation that about 100 donors attended. There they sketched out the path forward for DeSantis, which included promises that the governor would have the best infrastructure on the ground and would be the best-funded candidate. The briefing stressed that the campaign was focusing on the first four early states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — and that DeSantis planned to winthe first two states by campaigning “in living rooms,” and other in-person events. The advisers argued that will be a juxtaposition with mega-rallies that Trump typically holds. The presenters said that Iowa is “critical” to the campaign, and promised to have a strong effort to reach voters there, according to those who attended. DeSantis’ team cast the contest as a two-person race against Trump and predicted that the primary would likely be decided after Super Tuesday on March 5. In the briefing, the staff made clear there the campaign would seek to create a contrast with Trump, including that DeSantis would position himself as a “values” candidate, because of his past emphasis on parental rights education and culture war issues versus Trump, who would be bogged down by legal woes, including a criminal case and the jury decision finding him liable for sexual assault and defamation. “There was a lot of excitement,” said one donor who was in the room. “This is not a patch-together superdelegate strategy. It’s a shock and awe in the first four states.” Beyond the ground game push in the early states, DeSantis’ campaign is holding nearly two dozen fundraisers in Texas, Florida, California, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey over the next month, according to a schedule provided to NBC News. DeSantis is meeting with donors over dinner Thursday where he will give a discuss the early stages of the campaign. The formal launch kicks off DeSantis' clash with Trump, whose endorsement of DeSantis in Florida’s 2018 gubernatorial campaign helped him build a national political brand. DeSantis’ campaign stumbling out of the gates was very much noticed by Trump, who trolled DeSantis in a rambling post on his own social media site Truth Social that mentioned North Korea’s dictator. “‘Rob,’” Trump wrote, a name he has started using to refer to DeSantis. “My red button is bigger, better, stronger and is working (TRUTH!), yours does not! (Per my conversation with Kim Jong Un, of North Korea, soon to be my friend. "
Texas House committee recommends Attorney General Ken Paxton be impeached,Dareh Gregorian,"May 26, 2023, 12:15 AM UTC",Politics News,"A Texas House committee on Thursday unanimously voted to recommend that state Attorney General Ken Paxton be impeached and removed from office. The state House of Representatives could vote on the recommendation as soon as Friday. The five-member GOP-led investigative committee met Wednesday to discuss the allegations of wrongdoing against Paxton, a fellow Republican and the state's top lawyer. Investigators for the House General Investigating committee told the panel there was evidence that Paxton had repeatedly broken state laws, including misuse of official information, abuse of official capacity and retaliation. Paxton tweeted the allegations against him were based on “hearsay and gossip, parroting long-disproven claims” and being championed by “RINOs” — Republicans in name only. Chris Hilton, the chief of general litigation for Paxton's office, called the committee's probe ""illegal."" He said ""impeachment is completely foreclosed by Texas law"" in Paxton's case, because the alleged misconduct predates his most recent election. Some of the allegations against Paxton date back years. He's been awaiting trial on an indictment for state securities fraud charges from 2015.  He was sued in 2020 by four of his former aides, who alleged that he fired them for reporting him to federal law enforcement for allegedly taking bribes and using his office to help one of his campaign contributors. The parties reached a $3.3 million settlement earlier this year, but the Texas Legislature has balked at using taxpayer money to pay for the settlement. The House committee started its probe after the settlement agreement. Paxton's office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening, has denied any wrongdoing and maintained all the allegations against him are politically motivated. If the full House votes to impeach Paxton, he'd be removed immediately pending the resolution of a trial on the charges in the state Senate, the Texas Tribune reported. Hilton told reporters in Austin that voters were aware of the allegations against Paxton, and re-elected him this past November anyway. ""The voters have spoken — they want Ken Paxton as their attorney general,"" Hilton said. "
How major brands were forced into the conservative plan to target LGBTQ people,Jo Yurcaba,"May 25, 2023, 11:57 PM UTC",OUT News,"Bud Light and Target were not always political punching bags. But both companies have been drawn into the center of a long-brewing conservative battle after the brands released campaigns supporting or featuring LGBTQ people. Target announced Tuesday it was pulling some LGBTQ-themed items from stores following what a company spokesperson described as “threats” to employees over this year’s line of Pride Month merchandise. In interviews, Target customers and employees at stores in North Carolina and Texas said the company moved Pride collections away from the front of the store. Bud Light, meanwhile, drew backlash from right-wing commentators after partnering with the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney on a marketing campaign in April. Influential conservative figureheads called for a boycott, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — a contender for the GOP presidential nod — said he would never drink Bud Light again. Sales have continued to plummet. But several mainstream brands have publicly supported LGBTQ people for years. So what’s different now? Advocates and marketing experts say it’s the growing power of a vocal minority of far-right political commentators, conservative politicians and religious legal groups, which have led the calls to boycott the companies while these right-wing groups and individuals also support a historic wave of state legislation that seeks to restrict LGBTQ rights. Yet another recent uproar centered on the Dodgers, which faced pressure from conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to disinvite the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a decades-old LGBTQ nonprofit, from the team’s annual LGBTQ+ Pride Night. The team later reversed course, re-inviting the group, and drew more criticism from conservatives. The most protracted battle of all concerns Disney, which has been locked in an increasingly bitter feud with DeSantis. The root of the conflict: Disney’s decision, under former CEO Bob Chapek, to publicly oppose Florida’s so-called Don’t Say Gay bill restricting classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. DeSantis hit back, targeting the media giant’s special self-governing status in Orlando, home to Walt Disney World. The firestorm around these brands stems in part from efforts made by corporations to be more inclusive. In recent years, against a backdrop of growing cultural visibility for historically marginalized communities, consumer-focused companies have increasingly featured LGBTQ people in advertising, marketing and other public-facing initiatives, such as Pride events. Of course, major companies also saw a clear capitalist incentive: LGBTQ people in the U.S. collectively represent roughly $900 billion in annual purchasing power, according to a 2019 report from LGBT Capital, a financial services company. That hasn’t made them immune to backlash that has been intensified in part by internet-fueled conspiracy theories and a wave of anti-LGBTQ bills in statehouses. Ari Drennen, the LGBTQ program director for Media Matters, a liberal watchdog organization, said a common thread connecting firestorms around Target and Bud Light’s campaign with Dylan Mulvaney is Matt Walsh, a political commentator for far-right website the Daily Wire. “He’s been one of the most strident voices pushing this forward,” Drennen said. “Now, they’ve been picked up kind of more broadly throughout the right-wing media from people following that lead, but he’s been the person who’s really been pushing this kind of aggressive boycott tactic.” She noted that Walsh declared victory over Target on social media, where he has 1.9 million followers on Twitter. “The goal is to make ‘pride’ toxic for brands. If they decide to shove this garbage in our face, they should know that they’ll pay a price. It won’t be worth whatever they think they’ll gain,” Walsh tweeted on Wednesday. “First Bud Light and now Target. Our campaign is making progress,” he added. “Let’s keep it going.” Walsh did not immediately respond to a message requesting comment. "
"On 3rd anniversary of George Floyd’s death, Biden stops GOP-led effort to block DC police reform law",The Associated Press,"May 25, 2023, 9:21 PM UTC",Joe Biden,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday — the third anniversary of George Floyd’s murder — vetoed an effort led by congressional Republicans to overturn a new District of Columbia law on improving police accountability. The law was part of a push to reform policing nationwide and passed in the wake of the police killing of Floyd in 2020 in Minneapolis. Biden has said he supported many parts of the law, including the banning of chokeholds, limiting use of deadly force, improving access to body cameras and requiring training for officers to de-escalate tense situations. “I believe we have an obligation to make sure that all our people are safe and that public safety depends on public trust,” Biden said in a statement to Congress vetoing the effort. “It is a core policy of my administration to provide law enforcement with the resources they need for effective, accountable community policing.” The veto comes as Democrats in Congress have twice this year joined with Republicans to try to block a crime and policing law in the district. The first effort Biden supported — overturning changes to the district’s criminal code. Washington is not a state; and it lacks the same rights that states have to make and amend laws. While Congress has allowed the city’s residents some powers of “home rule,” it has retained the power to overturn district government actions. District residents also do not have voting members of Congress. Still, Congress has not regularly used its power to repeal — until this year. Biden’s signature two months ago marked the first time in more than three decades that Congress nullified the capital city’s laws through the disapproval process — and reflected a shift in the long-held Democratic position that the federal government should let D.C. govern itself. The earlier bill was an overhaul to the District of Columbia’s criminal code. It hasn’t been updated substantially since it was first drafted in 1901 — though Black people have been disproportionately affected by the criminal laws, similar to many other cities. The revisions would have redefined some crimes, changed criminal justice policies and reworked how sentences should be handed down after convictions. It also would have done away with mandatory minimum sentences for many crimes and would have reduced the maximum penalties for burglary, carjacking and robbery. The Senate approved the House bill that sought to overturn the criminal code changes. Biden signed that resolution, ultimately blocking the D.C. law. The president and members of both parties expressed concern about rising violent crime rates in cities nationwide and said the revisions could lead to rising crime. In D.C., homicides in the city had risen for four years straight before they dropped around 10% in 2022. The 2021 murder count of 227 was the highest since 2003. The Senate also voted to overturn the District of Columbia law enacted last year to improve police accountability, after six Democrats voted for the GOP-led resolution. But this time, Biden wasn’t on board. “The Congress should respect the District of Columbia’s right to pass measures that improve public safety and public trust. I continue to call on the Congress to pass commonsense police reform legislation,” Biden said. And the president, in a separate missive, also offered condolences to the family of George Floyd, whose death sparked anew protests over police killings of Black people, and calls to reform law enforcement nationwide. “George Floyd’s murder exposed for many what Black and brown communities have long known and experienced — that we must make a whole of society commitment to ensure that our nation lives up to its founding promise of fair and impartial justice for all under the law,” he said.

Sen. Tuberville's hold on military promotions will apply to Biden's new Joint Chiefs nominee,Frank Thorp V,"May 25, 2023, 7:14 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 8:50 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s hold on military promotions will apply to Air Force Gen. C.Q. Brown Jr.’s elevation to chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, his spokesperson told NBC News. Tuberville, R-Ala., has faced bipartisan criticism for stalling promotions of more than 150 military officials in protest of a recent Department of Defense policy that provides travel expenses and paid time off for service members and their dependents seeking abortions. Biden formally announced Thursday that he has picked Brown to serve as the next chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replacing Army Gen. Mark Milley when his term ends in October. If Brown is confirmed, he would be the second Black man to hold the position, following the late Colin Powell, who served under former President George W. Bush. The president called Brown a “fearless leader and unyielding patriot,” noting he was confirmed to his current post as Air Force chief of staff in 2020 by a vote of 98-0. “I urge the Senate to once again confirm General Brown with the same overwhelming bipartisan support from him for his new role,” Biden said. Senate approval of the promotions of top level-officers and generals is a task that's usually quick and smooth, but any single senator can make it less so. Most military promotions are approved by the Senate by unanimous consent, meaning all 100 senators agree to approve them without a vote. Tuberville is using a procedural tactic to plug up the speedy confirmation of military officials, which will apply to Brown as well, his office said, because the hold applies to all one-star nominations and above. While Tuberville's hold can’t actually block the Senate from processing any promotion, it can dramatically slow down a process that is typically done without a vote at all. Adam Hodge, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said Thursday that ""Tuberville is threatening our national security with his political gamesmanship and risking our military readiness by depriving our armed forces of leadership at a critical time."" ""As we face persistent threats to our national security all over the world, we need our military nominees — and certainly our next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to be confirmed quickly. Senators shouldn’t play politics with our military its readiness or our military families,"" Hodge said in a statement. Asked earlier this month if he supported Tuberville’s holds, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-K.Y., said: “No, I don’t support putting a hold on military nominations. I don’t support that.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in March, “One senator — just one single senator, my colleague from Alabama, Sen. Tuberville — is blocking all general and flag officer confirmations, taking our military, our national security, our safety hostage."" Tuberville has said he will keep the hold on the promotions until the policy is changed. “Over the past 40 years, I don’t recall one military person ever complaining that we weren’t performing enough abortions,"" he declared at a Senate hearing earlier this year. “I want our military to be the strongest and the deadliest it has ever been but also want the administration to follow the law.” "
Oath Keepers founder sentenced to 18 years in Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy case,Ryan J. Reilly,"May 25, 2023, 4:59 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 8:37 PM UTC",Capitol riot,"WASHINGTON — The founder of the far-right Oath Keepers has been sentenced to 18 years in federal prison in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol following his conviction on seditious conspiracy. The sentence for Stewart Rhodes is the longest imposed on a Jan. 6 defendant to date. In a politically-charged speech in the courtroom just before his sentencing, he called himself a ""political prisoner"" and said that when he talked about ""regime change"" in a phone call with supporters earlier this week, he meant he hopes that former President Donald Trump will win in 2024. The judge disagreed that Rhodes had been locked up for politics, saying it was his actions that led to his criminal convictions. “You, sir, present an ongoing threat and a peril to this country and to the republic and to the very fabric of this democracy,"" Judge Amit Mehta said before handing down the sentence. Rhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy in November along with Kelly Meggs, a fellow Oath Keepers member. ""They won't fear us until we come with rifles in hand,"" Rhodes wrote in a message ahead of the Jan. 6 attack. After the attack, in a recording that was played in court during his trial, he said his only regret was that they “should have brought rifles.” Wearing an orange prison jumpsuit Thursday, Rhodes said he believes the only crime he committed was opposing those who are “destroying our country.” Mehta told Rhodes that he was found guilty of seditious conspiracy “not because of your beliefs, not because you supported the other guy, not because Joe Biden is president right now,” but because of the facts of the case, and his actions before, during and after Jan. 6. “You are not a political prisoner, Mr. Rhodes,” he said. Meggs was also sentenced by Judge Mehta Thursday, to 12 years in federal prison. Mehta said Meggs did not pose the same continuing threat as Rhodes and a shorter sentence was more appropriate. The 12-year sentence for Meggs is the third longest handed down for a Jan. 6 defendant. An emotional Meggs delivered a statement and apologized to his family for the pain and suffering he’d caused them. Meggs’ sister, brother and son were in the courtroom — his wife Connie, who also participated in the Jan. 6 riot and has been separately convicted on multiple counts, was not present. “I want to apologize to those that I’ve disappointed and let down,” Meggs said. “My deepest regret is the pain and suffering I’ve caused my family.” Rhodes and Meggs were put on trial alongside Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell, fellow Oath Keepers who were convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting, but not seditious conspiracy. Watkins and Harrelson will be sentenced Friday. Rhodes took the stand in his case, saying at the trial that the other members of the Oath Keepers were ""stupid"" to storm the Capitol and that he disagreed with those who went inside; Rhodes did not enter the building. “I had no idea that any Oath Keeper was even thinking about going inside or would go inside,” he said. But the government also produced messages in which Rhodes said he thought that Jan. 6 was the last opportunity to stop what he saw as a takeover of the government. ""On the 6th, they are going to put the final nail in the coffin of this Republic, unless we fight our way out. With Trump (preferably) or without him, we have no choice,"" Rhodes wrote in a message ahead of Jan. 6. He also celebrated Oath Keepers' actions in the immediate aftermath of the attack, after meeting with other members of the group at an Olive Garden restaurant in Virginia that night. “Patriots, it was a long day but a day when patriots began to stand,"" he wrote the night of Jan. 6. ""Stand now or kneel forever. Honor your oaths. Remember your legacy."" Prior to Thursday's sentence, Peter Schwartz, who was armed with a wooden tire knocker and engaged in a series of assaults on officers during the Capitol attack, had received the longest time behind bars for a Jan. 6 defendant: just more than 14 years. Schwartz had 38 prior convictions. "
Supreme Court delivers blow to wetlands protections in win for Idaho landowners,Lawrence Hurley,"May 25, 2023, 2:13 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 8:24 PM UTC",Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday significantly weakened a landmark water pollution law by ruling that an Idaho couple's property does not include wetlands subject to federal oversight under the law. The ruling, in which all the justices agreed in the outcome but differed on the legal reasoning, concluded that Mike and Chantell Sackett's land does not fall under jurisdiction of the 1972 Clean Water Act, so they do not require a federal permit to build on the property. The decision ends a yearslong battle between the Sacketts and the federal government and is a victory for conservative groups and business interests opposed to the broad application of the water pollution law. President Joe Biden criticized the decision, saying it ""upends the legal framework that has protected America's waters for decades."" The ruling ""defies the science that confirms the critical role of wetlands in safeguarding our nation's streams, rivers and lakes from chemicals and pollutants,"" he said in a statement. Damien Schiff, the Sacketts’ lawyer, said the decision “returns the scope of the Clean Water act to its original and proper limits.” The decision marks a “profound win for property rights and the constitutional separation of powers,” he added. The ruling is another example of the court's conservative justices powering a decision that curbs broad power of federal agencies, a consistent theme in recent years. In reaching its broader legal conclusion, the court ruled on a 5-4 vote in an opinion authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito that Clean Water Act jurisdiction extends only to wetlands that are ""indistinguishable"" from larger bodies of water by having a ""continuous surface connection."" The wetlands on the Sacketts' property, he wrote, are ""distinguishable from any possibly covered waters."" The ruling will alleviate some burdens on landowners, including major business interests, Alito said, because the law ""can sweep broadly enough to criminalize mundane activities like moving dirt."" The impact will be felt nationwide, with environmental groups saying millions of acres of wetlands will no longer be under federal jurisdiction. Unless states move to strengthen their own environmental laws, property owners will have considerable freedom to fill in wetlands without going through the federal permitting process previously required. Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the court's three liberal justices in disagreeing with the majority's new test. ""By narrowing the act's coverage of wetlands to only adjoining wetlands, the court's new test will leave some long-regulated adjacent wetlands no longer covered by the Clean Water Act, with significant repercussions for water quality and flood control throughout the United States,"" he wrote. Under the court's new approach, the ability to regulate the levee system on the Mississippi River and effectively oversee the Chesapeake Bay could both be threatened, Kavanaugh said. Levees dividing wetlands from the Mississippi River mean those wetlands could be outside of federal oversight and wetlands vital to the the Chesapeake Bay could be filled in without requiring federal permits, he said. In a separate opinion, liberal Justice Elena Kagan took aim at the majority for rewriting a statute that Congress had enacted. She compared the ruling with the court's decision last year to limit the scope of the Clean Air Act as part of efforts to combat climate change. ""The vice in both instances is the same: the court's appointment of itself as the national decision-maker on environmental policy,"" she said. The case saw the Sacketts return to the Supreme Court for the second time after the justices ruled in their favor in an earlier case in 2012. Both cases involve the same underlying dispute: their effort to build a property on land they own in Priest Lake, Idaho, parts of which the EPA has deemed a protected wetland, meaning the land is subject to federal jurisdiction and building on it requires a permit. The legal dispute focused on whether the Sacketts could challenge an EPA compliance order in court after they had filled the affected area with gravel and sand without obtaining a permit. The fight, which began in 2007, continued over whether the land was a wetland at all. The Sacketts returned to the Supreme Court after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, ruled in August 2021 in favor of the federal government in its determination that the area did constitute a wetland. The law on how to define a wetland — of key interest to property developers and other business interests — has long been muddled and was not resolved when the Supreme Court decided an earlier case on the issue. In 2006, four justices said the Clean Water Act covered wetland with a “continuous surface connection” to a waterway, but there was not a clear majority. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who provided the fifth vote in that 5-4 ruling, came up with his own test, which said the law provided jurisdiction over wetlands with a “significant nexus” to a waterway. Successive presidential administrations have sought to bring clarity to the law, with Democrats generally favoring greater federal power and Republicans, backed by business interests, saying that Clean Water Act jurisdiction should be limited. In Thursday's ruling, the court rejected the significant nexus test and appeared to embrace the approach taken by the four-justice bloc in the 2006 case. Sam Sankar, a lawyer at environmental group Earthjustice said up to 90 million acres of formerly protected wetlands could now be under threat. With liberal-leaning states likely to enact new wetland protection laws, ""the on-the-ground impacts will be most severe in states that are most favorable to polluters and least interested in environmental protections,"" he added. While environmental activists were downbeat, the business community was delighted with a decision that will be a boon for companies across various industries, including energy and construction. “The Supreme Court has provided long overdue relief for companies and landowners across our nation,” said Marty Durbin, a senior official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Biden administration finalized its own rule in December that largely reverted to the interpretation that existed prior to actions taken by both the Obama and the Trump administrations, although the new rule had already faced its own legal challenges. As a result of the Supreme Court ruling, the EPA will now have to return to the drawing board. "
Supreme Court rules for homeowner in 'equity theft' dispute,Lawrence Hurley,"May 25, 2023, 4:40 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 7:21 PM UTC",Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court  on Thursday ruled in favor of a 94-year-old woman over her claim that a Minnesota county violated the Constitution by keeping a $25,000 profit when it sold her home in a tax foreclosure sale. The court concluded unanimously that Geraldine Tyler can pursue her argument that Hennepin County's decision to keep the surplus violated the takings clause of the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which requires that the government pay compensation when property is taken. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, in a reference to a passage from the Bible, that taxpayers are only required to pay the government what it is owed. ""The taxpayer must render unto Caesar what is Caesar's but no more,"" he wrote. Tyler’s home in Hennepin County, which includes the city of Minneapolis, was seized because she owed $15,000 in taxes and fees. But the county sold the home for $40,000 and kept all the proceeds, Tyler’s lawyers at the Pacific Legal Foundation say. The conservative group, which often litigates property rights issues, calls the practice “home equity theft.” ""This decision affirms that property rights are fundamental and don’t depend solely on state law. The court’s ruling makes clear that home equity theft is not only unjust, but unconstitutional,"" said Christina Martin, a Pacific Legal Foundation lawyer. The group said in a report last year that a dozen states regularly allow a government to take more than it is owed in taxes and that other states have laws that could permit the practice in some circumstances. The remaining states return the surplus proceeds when seized properties are sold. Six states — Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Montana, Nebraska and New Jersey — allow private investors to retain equity in properties once delinquent taxes are paid, the foundation says. Others allow the government to pocket the remaining equity when properties are sold. Tyler bought the one-bedroom condominium in a north Minneapolis neighborhood in 1999 and lived there for more than a decade. It was only after she had moved into a home for seniors that she fell behind on her taxes, starting in 2011. The county seized the property in 2015, with Tyler owing $2,311 in taxes, as well as almost $13,000 in related fees, including interest and penalties. A year later, the county sold it for $40,000, keeping the $25,000 in profit. In Tyler’s case, the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected her claims in February 2022. The state said in court papers that under Minnesota law it “provides ample opportunity for property owners to protect their interests” before properties are seized. Owners have three years to pay the taxes and have an opportunity to repurchase the seized properties. "
Steve Bannon’s trial in ‘We Build the Wall’ scheme set for May 2024,The Associated Press,"May 25, 2023, 5:29 PM UTC",Politics News,"NEW YORK — Steve Bannon, the conservative strategist and longtime ally of Donald Trump, will stand trial next May on charges that he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S. southern border, a judge said Thursday. Bannon’s trial in the “We Build the Wall” case will start May 27, 2024, right after the former president is scheduled to stand trial in the same Manhattan courtroom in an unrelated criminal case. Bannon, 69, pleaded not guilty last September following his indictment on state money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg took up the case after Bannon’s federal prosecution was cut short by a Trump pardon. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state offenses. Bannon is accused of falsely promising donors that all money given to the We Build the Wall campaign would go toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, prosecutors allege that the money was used to enrich Bannon and others involved in the project. Brian Kolfage and Andrew Badolato pleaded guilty to federal charges and were sentenced to prison. A third defendant, Timothy Shea, was convicted in October and is scheduled to be sentenced next month. Judge Juan Manuel Merchan is presiding over both the Bannon and Trump cases. Bannon is free pending trial. Thursday’s hearing lasted all of four minutes. “We’ll see you back in here in May,” Bannon said as he left the courthouse in a black SUV. "
"DeSantis’ anti-DEI law is sparking ‘confusion, anxiety and fear’ among Florida faculty",Nicole Acevedo,"May 25, 2023, 5:21 PM UTC",Latino,"Faculty and staff at public colleges and universities in Florida say they are facing the consequences of a ""chilling effect"" stemming from a sweeping higher education law defunding diversity programs and restricting race and gender courses. ""It's a scary time for education,"" said Eduardo Padrón, president emeritus of Miami Dade College, who led the institution for almost 25 years. MDC enrolls more students of color than any other U.S. college, including the most Latino students. ""All the progress we have made to be more inclusive in Florida is going away,"" said Padrón, who received the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom for his efforts to expand higher education and make it more accessible. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed into law this month a bill banning public colleges and universities from using state or federal funds for programs that “advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion.” It also bans general education core courses that “distort” historical events or teach “identity politics.” ""What do they mean by identity politics? How would that affect a wide range of courses?"" said Nicole Morse, membership and organizing union chair at the United Faculty of Florida’s chapter at Florida Atlantic University. Morse said universities are now wondering if courses focusing on women, for example, or on the history of specific cultural groups or communities could still be taught under the new law. Morse said the law is ""written in such a vague way"" that it allows institutions to interpret it in wildly different ways — resulting in contradicting actions that ""create a climate of confusion, anxiety and fear."" Florida is not only home to the nation's third largest Latino population, but its public colleges and universities are the top institutions enrolling and graduating Latino students in the state, according to Excelencia in Education, one of the country’s leading education think tanks focused on Latino college completion. The law applies to the 40 public colleges and universities in the state. About a third of them (13) are designated Hispanic-serving institutions — where Hispanic students constitute at least 25% of full-time-equivalent undergraduate enrollment — and another 12 Florida colleges and universities may soon meet that standard, according to Santiago. ""There is concern about the chilling effect, most importantly for institutions that are trying to diversify, because they're hesitant to do anything without getting clear direction,"" said Deborah Santiago, Excelencia in Education's chief executive officer and co-founder. Paul Ortiz, a history professor at the University of Florida and a member of the United Faculty of Florida, recalled during a virtual education conference this month the ""panic"" felt across colleges and universities when an earlier version of the bill was introduced in the state House in February. Thinking that ""gender studies was over,"" university administrators started brainstorming contingency plans to move courses and professors into other departments. Ortiz said the union intervened and told administrators they couldn't change the terms and conditions of their employment based on their collective bargaining agreement. That was the start of administrators rushing to comply in anticipation of the law, according to Morse. ""They don't want to be on the wrong side of the law because it comes with such significant threats to performance funding,"" she said. But the language in the final version of the law still provides little guidance to administrators looking to preserve existing programs while also complying with the law. “People are interpreting the bill based on the public statements of the governor,” Morse said. A news release from DeSantis’ office said the new law “takes several steps to prevent woke ideologies from continuing to coopt our state universities and state colleges,” and DeSantis has said diversity, equity and inclusion “is coming to an end in the state of Florida.” The governor's office did not respond to a request for comment on whether it had any plans to provide additional guidance or clarification on the new law. Those most affected by the ban on diversity, equity and inclusion programs are university and college staff members in charge of running such programs, Ortiz said. An affected professional staffer at Florida International University, whose name is being withheld due to concerns over potential repercussions from the new law, said many in the state are scared of their ""jobs being taken away."" ""The feeling of being a staff member now, it’s like a shame thing or like 'We’re going to hide you away,'"" said the staffer, who is waiting to hear back from university leadership about her position, which provides university-wide support around diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Even though the program the staffer works for is covered by student fees, the salaries of the program's employees are covered by state funds that will go away once the law goes into effect. ""If there's no professional staff designated to implement those programs, I don't know who would do them,"" the staffer said. ""I'm just upset that those things will potentially go away for students, especially in the climate of Florida."" The law also directs the Board of Governors, which are mostly members DeSantis appoints, to include in periodic reviews of its institutions a directive on university programs “based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States and were created to maintain social, political, and economic inequities.” ""The state of Florida has made it clear that it wants to eliminate our ability to analyze and understand the roots of oppression and the possibility of renewal and social movement building,"" said Ortiz, the author of ""Emancipation Betrayed: The Hidden History of Black Organizing and White Violence in Florida From Reconstruction to the Bloody Election of 1920"" and a co-editor of ""Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South.""

White House unveils strategy to combat antisemitism,Rebecca Shabad,"May 25, 2023, 5:18 PM UTC",White House,"WASHINGTON — The White House on Thursday released a comprehensive plan to counter antisemitism across the U.S. that includes such things as addressing lack of education about the Holocaust, security at Jewish institutions and the proliferation of conspiracy theories on the Internet. The strategy features four pillars: increasing awareness and understanding of antisemitism, improving safety for Jewish communities, reversing the normalization of antisemitism and building solidarity among religious groups. ""We must say clearly and forcefully that antisemitism and all forms of hate and violence have no place in America,"" President Joe Biden said in a video clip at an event announcing the plan, which he said is the ""most ambitious and comprehensive U.S. government-led effort to fight antisemitism in American history."" Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a vice president, said at the event that antisemitism has divided American society. ""It threatens our democracy while undermining our American values of freedom, community and decency,"" he said. ""And antisemitism delivers simplistic, false and dangerous narratives that have led to extremists perpetrating deadly violence against Jews."" To increase awareness about antisemitism, outgoing White House domestic policy adviser Susan Rice said that next year, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. will launch ""the first U.S.-based Holocaust education research center."" She also said that the National Endowment for the Humanities will expand its investment in K-12 education on Jewish history and added that federal agencies have ""committed to incorporating information about antisemitic bias and discrimination into their diversity, equity inclusion and accessibility training programs."" Biden's homeland security adviser, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, said that to improve security at synagogues and Jewish institutions, the administration has increased funding to improve the physical security of those buildings and has asked Congress for additional resources. The Department of Homeland Security will also reach out to Jewish communities to ""ensure they are receiving and utilizing all the training and resources that are available to them,"" she said. In an effort to stop antisemitism from becoming mainstream, Sherwood-Randall said that the White House plan calls on tech companies to establish a zero-tolerance policy for hate speech on their platforms and to ensure that their algorithms do not pass along hate speech and extreme content to users. Deborah Lipstadt, the U.S. special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, called the plan a ""historic moment in the modern fight against what’s known as the world’s oldest hatred."" She noted that they were introducing the strategy in the same building that once housed the State and War departments and ""a form of Jew-hatred took shape as official policy as State Department officials erected so-called paper walls around this country to prevent us from entering our borders."" Under the plan, the FBI and National Counterterrorism Center will conduct an annual threat assessment ""on antisemitic drivers of transnational violent extremism that can be shared with technology companies and other nongovernmental partners,"" said the White House, which released a declassified version of its first assessment on Thursday.

"As debt default looms, America yawns",Alex Seitz-Wald,"May 15, 2023, 8:00 AM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 3:29 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — A mass shooting in Allen, Texas, and another in Cleveland, Texas. The first-ever indictment of a former president, followed by a sex abuse verdict, followed by the indictment of a sitting congressman. Fighter jets shooting down UFOs over North America. War in Ukraine. Threats of war in Asia. A flood of migrants crossing the southern border. Actual floods in California. And now a new calamity. A nation that has been deluged with head-spinning news day after day is faced with a budgetary impasse that could set off a recession or worse. A divided Congress has only about three weeks to raise the country's borrowing limit and thereby keep America from defaulting on its debts. Default has never happened before and could push the U.S. and global economy into harrowing territory, economists say. But for many Americans, that scenario remains an abstraction far removed from day-to-day concerns. And there are signs that a crisis-weary population wants to sit this one out. Follow along for live updates A recent focus group convened by the research firm Engagious asked 11 Georgia voters who backed President Joe Biden in 2020 if they worried that the government would blow through a looming deadline and default on its debt. Not one hand went up. Corporate America has largely sidestepped the contentious debate unfolding in Washington. Tom Daschle, the former Senate Democratic leader, said he was recently briefed on a private poll that showed most of the people surveyed were “skeptical” of the doomsday scenarios. Even those who grasped the potential consequences believed that the two sides would eventually cut a deal staving off default. “Global investors and Americans more generally appear largely unruffled by the fast-approaching X-date,” said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics and a veteran of Washington spending wars, referring to the date in early June when the Treasury Department forecasts it won't be able to pay the bills. “The stock market remains firm as does the value of the U.S. dollar and much of the bond market. I suspect the key reason for the blasé attitude toward the debt limit is everyone thinks they’ve seen this movie before many times over the years and now know the ending.” The problem, though, is that while panic is counterproductive in most crises, it may be necessary to resolve this one by putting pressure on elected officials to compromise and avert disaster. ""That financial markets are calm raises the odds that lawmakers won’t act in time, as it likely will take some turmoil in markets to generate the political will necessary to get lawmakers to act,” Zandi said. A standoff over the debt ceiling in 2011 offers an illustration of both the costs of brinksmanship and a president's persuasive power. Then-President Barack Obama delivered a rare prime-time speech about one week before the government would have breached the debt ceiling. He urged Americans to call Congress and ""make your voice heard."" The public's response was enthusiastic enough to crash the websites of congressional leaders. Obama and Republican lawmakers struck a deal days later. They averted default, but considerable damage was inflicted anyway. A Treasury Department report in 2013 — amid yet another debt ceiling debate — concluded that the impasse in 2011 harmed job growth, roiled financial markets and lowered consumer and business confidence. So far, Biden has given no such prime-time speech. The markets, until now, have mostly shrugged. Google Trends data show far fewer internet searches for terms like ""debt ceiling"" than in 2013. And the three major cable news channels have mentioned the debt ceiling only a third as much as they did in 2013, according to an analysis prepared for NBC News by Media Matters. Inside the White House, advisers believe there is still enough time to strike a deal with Republicans and avert disaster. Biden is steadily ratcheting up the pressure on Republicans where they live, traveling  recently to a New York swing district represented by a Republican. ""We've not reached the crunch point yet,"" Biden told reporters on Saturday. A fresh piece of economic data suggests that the awakening may have begun. A report released Friday by the University of Michigan shows that consumer sentiment is falling ""alongside the proliferation of negative news about the economy, including the debt crisis standoff."" In the coming days, Biden will take more questions from the press about the debt ceiling, “Which is a way of helping break through,” a White House aide said. The White House has also expanded its communications team, tapping Rob Friedlander of the Office of Management and Budget to help explain and lay out its position on the debt ceiling. “A big part of this is making it clear to the American people what the stakes are so they can communicate that to their representatives” in Congress, the White House aide continued, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House’s strategy. The attention paid to the debt ceiling crisis in the Obama era may have been a product of a simpler political time, when a near-existential threat to the nation was an anomaly, not another Thursday. Donald Trump was a reality TV show host, social media was still a novelty and a congressman yelling “you lie” at the president seemed like a really big deal. “We all have shorter attention spans and crisis fatigue,” said Dan Pfeiffer, who was a top communications official in the Obama White House during those earlier fights. Like Marvel Studios struggling to keep audiences engaged after they’ve seen the universe saved from the brink of destruction 32 times, a partisan congressional fight just doesn’t have the same draw, however grave the stakes. “Because default was avoided the last two times, there seems to be an assumption from a lot of people and the markets that it will be avoided again,” Pfeiffer said. “That is a deeply naive view in my opinion.” Both sides are holding out, convinced the other will cave once the pressure is on. But what if pressure never builds because the public and the markets aren’t paying attention? In the focus group of 11 Georgia voters, the moderator asked how many had followed news about the debt ceiling fight. Only four raised their hands. Zandi said he believes that public unease will inevitably kick in. “I suspect markets will be calm until they are not. That is, the blasé attitude toward the debt limit will quickly give way to panicked concern literally between one day and the next at some point in the next few weeks,” he said. Absent pressure from their constituents, Republicans in Congress have space to stake out a maximalist position and insist on sweeping budget cuts in return for raising the debt ceiling. And the most powerful voice in the party, Trump, is egging them on. “I say to the Republicans out there — congressmen, senators — if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default,” Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, said at a CNN town hall Wednesday night. He dismissed a default as “really psychological more than anything else.” If people have followed the issue at all, they’ve concluded that this is simply one more partisan fight in Washington that reinforces perceptions of broader dysfunction, political analysts from both parties said. The White House’s belief is that Biden will escape blame if negotiations collapse and that voters will conclude congressional Republicans are at fault. That may be overly optimistic. If the debt ceiling isn’t raised and the worst forecasts come true — stock markets collapse and jobs disappear — people will blame whoever is in charge, starting with Biden, some analysts said. A former Obama campaign adviser said that inside the Biden White House, some aides are viewing the budget standoff with “unrealism.” “There are people there who are saying, ‘Oh, people always blame the Republicans because they know the Republicans are crazy,'” this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. “Whereas I believe the blame is more even, or even tilted toward the president.” It would be a mistake for the White House to assume voters will parse the varying levels of responsibility should default take place, analysts said. “The American public is not going to follow the ins and outs of how the debt negotiations went south,” said Sarah Longwell, who conducts regular focus groups with voters and who publishes the conservative website The Bulwark. Everyday voters, she said, “are going to blame the people in charge because that’s what people do. They’re going to blame him [Biden] because they’re not following it closely. They’re going to blame the people in charge.” Some voters may not fully understand the distinction between a government shutdown — something that is comparatively limited and now somewhat routine — and an unprecedented default, which could drive up interest rates on home mortgages and credit cards, and raise the unemployment rate by as much as 5 percentage points. Controlling a formidable megaphone, Biden is positioned to convey the enormous stakes involved and influence public opinion. But he has much work to do on that front, analysts said. “Right now, the communication [from the White House] has not been commensurate with the cataclysmic nature of the consequences should this go off the rails,” Longwell said. “People view this as a Washington process story that they’re not focused on.” If Biden “wants people to focus on it, and he wants to push Republicans on it, then he is going to have to go into overdrive on communicating with people on the personal consequences” of a default, Longwell said. An open question is whether Biden can sell the public on the dangers that await: Will Americans listen, as they did when Obama beseeched them to call Congress? Biden's job approval rating averages 42 percent, according to Real Clear Politics. That's the same as Obama's when he delivered his prime-time speech on the debt ceiling, Gallup surveys show. “As a partisan conservative, I would say he [Biden] has been a pretty effective president,” said Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman from Illinois. “He’s just a s--- communicator. He just cannot communicate forcefully enough, and that’s really lacking right now, big time. There’s been zero sense of urgency on his part."" "
"Harris, on the periphery of debt ceiling negotiations, works to make the case to the American public",Yamiche Alcindor,"May 18, 2023, 3:12 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 3:27 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris is taking on a larger role in the White House’s efforts to talk to the public about the need to raise the debt ceiling — but thus far there is no indication she will be involved in daily negotiations. On Thursday, Harris pointedly criticized Republicans and urged what officials said were “thousands” of community leaders on a call to spread the word about the potential harms of a default. She was joined by Lael Brainard, the director of the National Economic Council. “Congressional Republicans claim they are threatening default because they want to lower our nation’s debt,” Harris said. “Let’s be clear: For Republicans in Congress, this issue is not really about lowering our nation’s debt, because if they really cared about lowering our debt, they would not — they would not — also fight to protect trillions of dollars in Trump tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations.” Follow along for live updates The briefing, where Harris emphasized the potential economic consequences if the ceiling isn't lifted, with even the threat of a breach proving economically devastating, underscores an emerging role for her as the White House looks to deploy her to explain what many Americans see as a complicated economic issue, a senior administration official said. “It is not some abstract policy debate,” Harris said Thursday. “You only need look back to 2011 to remember what it can mean right now. … By coming close to a default back then, prices in the stock market fell almost 20% for more than a year, millions of people lost money out of their retirement accounts, it became more difficult for both small and large businesses to secure loans, fill orders and hire new workers.” She added: “By some estimates, there would be 1 million more jobs today in our nation had that not happened. … And that was without an actual default.” She dropped off the call for a brief period during her remarks, which an official attributed to technical difficulties. The White House has struggled to rally concern from corporate America or voters — the kind of pressure Biden could use as leverage in negotiations with Republicans. After having been noticeably absent at the start of the negotiations, Harris is being tasked with trying to amp up the level of national concern and make the case that the outcome could be dire if a deal isn't reached. The senior official said the White House wants Harris to make the case about the potential for a global economic crisis that could affect hundreds of thousands of jobs, if not millions, as well as other aspects of American life, like retirement funds and homeownership rates. As part of the plan, Harris will leave most of the negotiations with congressional Republicans to staffers, including Louisa Terrell, Shalanda Young and Steve Ricchetti, the three aides Biden designated to represent him in the talks with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s team, the official said. (Terrell is the White House legislative affairs director, Young is the budget director, and Ricchetti is counselor to the president.) Harris, a former senator, has been increasingly visible in the White House's debt ceiling efforts after having not attended a meeting last week between Biden and the top four congressional leaders — there was an empty seat next to Biden where Harris traditionally sits in Oval Office meetings. This week, Harris was seated to the immediate right of the president at a second meeting with the same congressional leaders. Asked why Harris wasn't at the first meeting but attended the second, the senior administration official said that it was a “joint decision” between Biden and Harris to have her attend this time and that she “should be in those meetings because of not only just what’s at stake, but because of the role that she plays in the partnership.” The official said Biden “values her input, her thoughts and her opinion.” The official added that Harris has “used every opportunity to talk about the dangers and consequences of a Republican default and the real impact on the American people,” including doing a recent interview with local reporters in Atlanta. Harris said Thursday’s briefing call included community leaders, labor leaders and state and local elected officials representing all 50 states and the territories. The senior administration official said: “We’re convening a number of different leaders, representing a cross-section of organizations and groups and people, and we’re going to talk about what’s really at stake. Real people will be impacted by these decisions. And it’s important for the folks who are not just leading them but who they trust and who represent their best interests to understand those impacts.” The official added that there is “underlying optimism” that Republicans and Democrats will “get a deal done.” The U.S. is projected to exhaust all options to keep paying the country’s bills as early as June 1, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen repeated this week, giving Congress a closing timeline to reach a deal. Jamal Simmons, who worked for a year as Harris' communications director, said deploying her as a messenger to the public and everyday Americans in the debt ceiling negotiations plays to her strengths and her reputation. “Her skill from the Senate was in prosecuting a case against people,” Simmons said. “The thing she was most known for by most Americans from her time in the Senate were the Supreme Court hearings. And so people look to her for inspiration and for prosecuting an argument in the public eye. And that is the place where her strengths lie and where she is most useful to the administration.” Simmons added that it is important to have Harris attend high-profile meetings like the debt ceiling negotiations because millions of Americans voted for both her and Biden and expect Harris, a Black woman who connects with key constituencies for Democrats, to be in those rooms, especially as the 2024 election nears. “I always believe that Vice President Harris’ power lies in her appeal to regular Americans out in the country,” Simmons said. “Visually communicating that she’s a partner to the president is incredibly important to getting those voters animated to send them back to the White House.” Biden, as vice president, often joined President Barack Obama in negotiations and meetings with congressional leaders. Biden, a longtime veteran of the Senate, was tasked with negotiating with Congress during the 2011 debt crisis. Harris, who doesn't have the same relationships in the Senate, hasn't been tasked with negotiating with lawmakers. Biden “wants her input in this,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters this week. “She’s been part of this process throughout these conversations about the budget, about not defaulting.” But while Harris has been and will continue to be a “partner” to Biden in the process, her late entry into the conversation with the “Big Four” leaders is indicative of a more measured role. Two sources familiar with internal White House discussions couldn't say whether Harris would be part of future meetings. Another source familiar with the talks said, “She’ll leave the negotiating to the negotiators.” A source who has talked to people participating in the negotiations downplayed Harris’ role, calling her “a peripheral player at best.” “It’s between Biden and McCarthy, with Ricchetti and Shalanda Young,” the source said.

"U.S. still risks breaching debt limit on June 1, Treasury Secretary warns in new letter",Scott Wong,"May 22, 2023, 8:37 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 3:26 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday that it is ""highly likely"" the U.S. will run out of money to pay its bills as early as June 1 if the debt ceiling battle isn't resolved by then. The updated timeline comes after Yellen on May 15 set a June 1 deadline for the U.S. to extend the borrowing limit or risk a first-ever default on the country's debt, which she has repeatedly warned would have disastrous economic implications. ""With an additional week of information now available,"" Yellen wrote in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, ""I am writing to note that we estimate that it is highly likely that Treasury will no longer be able to satisfy all of the government’s obligations if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by early June, and potentially as early as June 1."" Follow along for live updates Yellen's new letter comes just ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Democratic President Joe Biden and McCarthy, who have been at odds on how to resolve the standoff. They have enlisted staff and allies to help negotiate a debt limit bill alongside a budget agreement that satisfies both parties. The core of the dispute is how much the federal government should spend in the next fiscal year, with House Republicans demanding cuts and other changes to budget policy changes that Democrats are reluctant to accept. Republicans control the House but any deal would need approval from the Democratic-led Senate. The U.S. hit the statutory debt limit in January and has since been using ""extraordinary measures"" to pay the bills. The Treasury Department has consistently given a timeline of early June for Congress to act or risk breaching the debt ceiling. The exact date has been adjusted along the way based on tax receipts, as is customary when setting the deadline. ""We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,"" Yellen wrote in her letter Monday. ""In fact, we have already seen Treasury’s borrowing costs increase substantially for securities maturing in early June,"" she continued. ""If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, it would cause severe hardship to American families, harm our global leadership position, and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests."" "
"Yellen says early June is 'hard deadline' for raising debt limit, warns bills will go unpaid",Summer Concepcion,"May 21, 2023, 2:48 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 3:16 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday that early June is a ""hard deadline"" for the federal government to raise the debt ceiling and warned that bills will go unpaid if Congress fails to reach a deal before the U.S. runs out of money, in an exclusive interview on “Meet the Press.” “I indicated in my last letter to Congress that we expect to be unable to pay all of our bills in early June and possibly as soon as June 1. And I will continue to update Congress, but I certainly haven’t changed my assessment,” Yellen said. “So I think that that’s a hard deadline.” Asked by NBC News' Chuck Todd if the country can stretch to June 15, when more tax payments are due, before defaulting on its debts, Yellen said the possibility is ""quite low."" ""Well, there’s always uncertainty about tax receipts and spending,"" she said. ""And so it’s hard to be absolutely certain about this, but my assessment is that the odds of reaching June 15th, while being able to pay all of our bills, is quite low."" Follow along for live updates Yellen warned that some of the country’s bills will go unpaid if the debt ceiling isn’t raised. “We take the debt ceiling seriously as a constraint on our ability to pay bills that are coming due,” she said. “And my assumption is that if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, there will be hard choices to make about what bills go unpaid.” The White House and Republican negotiators remain deadlocked on a deal to raise the debt ceiling after weeks of negotiations. House Republicans want to force major spending cuts that President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats oppose, making it unlikely the House bill will pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The president opened a press conference in Japan by urging Republicans to “move from their extreme positions,” which he criticized as “frankly unacceptable.” “It’s time for Republicans to accept that there is no bipartisan deal to be made solely solely on their partisan terms,” he said. “They have to move as well.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Sunday said he had a “productive” call with Biden, and they agreed to meet in-person Monday afternoon. “There’s no agreement, we’re still apart, the agreement was to get our teams back together so everyone clearly understands what we’re talking about, what they’re talking about,” McCarthy told reporters. ""Let them brief up the president, let him get some sleep. And he wanted to get together personally tomorrow — I agreed to that, we’d do that sometime in the afternoon. Time is of the essence.” Biden and McCarthy’s staffs are set to reconvene at 6 p.m. Sunday to discuss remaining issues, according to a White House official. Republicans returned to the debt ceiling negotiating table Friday night after temporarily pausing talks with the White House that they said were “not productive.” Rep. Garret Graves, a Louisiana Republican, who was tapped by McCarthy to lead negotiations with White House staff, told reporters they had ""a candid discussion about realistic numbers, a realistic path forward and something that truly changes the trajectory of this country’s spending and debt problem.” The U.S. hit the statutory debt limit in January and has been using “extraordinary measures” to pay the bills. Amid the ongoing stalemate in Congress, Biden recently said he was considering using the 14th Amendment to bypass the standoff and unilaterally raise the debt ceiling. Previous administrations have considered invoking the 14th Amendment to raise the borrowing limit, but they never used it — including the Obama administration in which Biden served as vice president. Asked whether using the 14th Amendment falls into the category of “extraordinary measures,” Yellen said Sunday it’s “used in a different way” and there “hasn’t been much discussion” of using it. “As President Biden said, I believe this morning, it doesn’t seem like something that could be appropriately used in these circumstances, given the legal uncertainty around it,” she said. “And given the tight time frame we’re on. So my devout hope is that Congress will raise the debt ceiling.” Biden did not rule out using the 14th Amendment when asked about it during his press conference in Japan: “I’m looking at the 14th Amendment as to whether or not we have the authority. “I think we have the authority,” he said. “The question is, could it be done and invoked in time that it could not would not be appealed, and as a consequence, pass the date in question, and still default on the debt. That’s a question that I think is unresolved.” Pressed again, Biden said that “a unilateral action that could succeed in a matter of two weeks or three weeks” has not been agreed upon. “That’s the issue,” he said. “So it’s up to lawmakers. But, my hope and intention is when we resolve this problem, I find a rationale to take it to the courts and see whether or not the 14th Amendment is in fact something that would be able to stop it.” "
'We're not there yet': Debt ceiling talks still stuck on federal spending levels,Scott Wong,"May 23, 2023, 5:02 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 3:13 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that bipartisan negotiators are not close to a deal but added that there was still time left to avert a potentially catastrophic default on the nation’s debt obligations by next week’s deadline. “We’re not there yet,” McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters after huddling behind closed doors with rank-and-file House Republicans, adding that the two sides could still strike a deal by June 1, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the nation will run out of money to pay its bills. Inside the private meeting at the Republican Party's Capitol Hill Club — steps from the Capitol, a venue where lawmakers are legally permitted to talk electoral politics that can't be hammered out inside government buildings — McCarthy’s message to his GOP colleagues about the state of debt talks was that “Nothing has been done. Nothing has changed,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. Follow along for live updates Later Tuesday morning, a trio of White House negotiators returned to the speaker’s suite in the Capitol for another round of talks following a late-night meeting that stretched past 11 p.m. — a positive sign that negotiations were continuing for a second straight day. But the White House officials — Shalanda Young, Steve Ricchetti and Louisa Terrell — departed the Capitol a little more than two hours later without providing any updates. The two sides do not plan to meet again Tuesday, but expect to convene on Wednesday morning, a Democratic source familiar with the talks said. McCarthy and Biden are also not expected to speak by phone on Tuesday, the source added. “We’re trying to give negotiators room,” the source said. McCarthy had described Monday’s one-on-one meeting with President Joe Biden as “productive” while cautioning reporters that it shouldn’t be confused with “progress.” McCarthy suggested that the divide on federal spending levels remained a major sticking point in the talks. Democrats have said they are OK with freezing spending at current levels. But House Republicans want to cut spending to the level that was approved in 2021, reversing increases that have happened in the intervening years. “Why are we in the problem we’re in? People have spent too much money and the Democrats want to even spend more than we spent last year. That is not going to happen,” McCarthy said Tuesday. “They still want to spend more money next year than we spent this year. That’s a red line.” A source familiar with the talks said once differences over the spending issue get resolved, it would ""help a lot"" in terms of getting a deal. Due to inflation, the source argued, a spending freeze would amount to a cut in real dollars. Returning to the negotiating table on Tuesday, Republicans sounded pessimistic about the state of debt ceiling talks and continued to express frustration that their White House counterparts were not acting with more urgency. “I don’t think things are going well,” said Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., whom McCarthy appointed as his representative in the room. “Until the White House understands that they have a spending crisis, they have a tax crisis, they have a debt crisis, we’re not going to be able to make this deal.” Walking alongside Graves, McHenry said there is a “lack of urgency” from the White House team to understand how long it will take to move a bill through Congress, a phrase the powerful Financial Services Committee chairman also uttered after McCarthy’s meeting with Biden the night before. “What we need is a team that is fully empowered by the White House to get the thing done.” “It’s very important to recognize that urgency should be the order of the day,” McHenry continued. “And that is not currently … the vibes I’m getting.” But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., added a note of caution when asked by reporters in Lexington Tuesday morning if he was concerned, saying, “Everybody needs to relax."" “Regardless of what may be said about the talks on a day-to-day basis, the president and the speaker will reaching agreement, it will ultimately be passed on a bipartisan vote in both the House and the Senate,"" he said. On Monday, Yellen warned McCarthy and other congressional leaders that June 1 remained the date when the U.S. could default on its debt barring a bipartisan deal to raise the debt ceiling. But as Republican lawmakers emerged from the Tuesday morning meeting, hard-right conservatives suggested that the Treasury secretary was offering empty threats. “I don’t buy June 1,” Norman, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said when asked about Yellen’s so-called X-date. “We need to subpoena her and get her plan.” Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., echoed that skepticism. “If Janet Yellen can really prove that the receipts and deposits create this default on June 1, she should come to Congress and prove that,” Gaetz said. "
"Debt limit negotiations hit 'speed bump,' Democratic official says",Kristen Welker,"May 24, 2023, 2:23 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 3:12 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — Negotiations over how to address the debt limit to avoid a catastrophic default have hit a ""speed bump,"" a Democratic official familiar with the talks told NBC News on Wednesday. After days of citing ""productive"" negotiations, the tone in Washington appeared to shift Tuesday after the negotiators disbanded at 1 p.m. ET with no plans for further talks or meetings between the leaders. The Democratic official argued that President Joe Biden has ""negotiated in good faith"" on the nation's budget but said that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has ""bowed to MAGA extremists who want no compromise."" The source said far-right House Republicans are pressuring McCarthy not to budge. Follow along for live updates Biden is ""willing to meet the speaker halfway,"" according to the official, who said that Biden has offered three items to Republicans: a spending freeze that cuts spending by more than $1 trillion over a decade, rescinding unspent Covid relief funds and a two-year cap on spending. For his part, McCarthy arrived at the Capitol on Wednesday saying, ""We'll get together this morning"" when asked whether there would be negotiations during the day. The speaker said he hasn't spoken, however, to Biden since Monday and is talking to the White House's negotiating team. McCarthy reiterated that Republicans want to spend less than the country spent in 2023. Asked how much less, he said, ""That’s part of the negotiating. Democrats don’t even want to spend less, they want to spend more."" He has rejected a spending freeze at 2023 levels even though it would amount to a real dollar cut when adjusted for inflation. The status of the talks from the White House’s perspective reflected McCarthy’s comments Tuesday when he said that they weren’t close to a deal on the debt ceiling. “We’re not there yet,” he told reporters after huddling behind closed doors with rank-and-file House Republicans, adding that the two sides could still strike an agreement by June 1. McCarthy had said that his meeting with Biden at the White House on Monday was ""productive"" but suggested that the major hurdle remained a disagreement over federal spending levels. Democrats have said they'd support freezing spending at current levels. House Republicans, however, want to cut spending to the level that was approved in 2021. The GOP leader is under pressure from rank-and-file House Republicans not to give in to the White House. On Wednesday, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, circulated a memo to his GOP colleagues with talking points on the debt ceiling. It urges Republicans to give McCarthy ""the strongest hand"" by making clear that the conference is ""unified to hold the line"" and ""messaging the specific purposes behind the Limit, Save, Grow Act,"" the GOP-sponsored legislation to address the debt limit that passed the House. Roy sought to address criticism from Democrats by laying out possible responses. For example, on the criticism that work requirements ""are draconian and uncompassionate reforms,"" Roy suggested responding with, ""Our reforms are based on the 1996 welfare reforms that then-Senator Biden supported under President Clinton."" On Tuesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., told Semafor that the ability of one Republican to motion to remove the House speaker ""has given us the best version of Speaker McCarthy."" He added, ""I think my conservative colleagues for the most part support Limit, Save, Grow, and they don’t feel like we should negotiate with our hostage."" "
Ron DeSantis is stuck in the middle and getting punched from above and below,Jonathan Allen,"May 25, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",2024 Election,"WASHINGTON — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis envisions a ""two-horse race"" for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination: him and former President Donald Trump. But for DeSantis to win, he will first have to make that vision a reality. And he'll have to do it after starting from a pinched position, with Trump punching down and the rest of the field punching up. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley led with a right hook Wednesday, asserting in a campaign video that DeSantis is nothing more than ""an echo"" of Trump. The former president, who now boasts a majority of Republican support, spent much of Wednesday insulting DeSantis in Truth Social media posts. ""Everyone [else] wants to make sure he's knocked out so they're No. 2,"" said David Urban, a former Trump adviser who has not endorsed a candidate. ""And Trump's being Trump."" The unusual squeeze is at once a testament to DeSantis' perceived strength and one of a series of grave challenges he faces in his ambitious quest to become the political dragon-slayer who felled two presidents — Trump and Joe Biden. He can expect little help from fellow Republicans who envy his position and would prefer to keep Trump's target on his back. Outside of Trump, DeSantis’ team is expecting a barrage of attacks from his opponents. But, as of now, advisers doesn’t see an upside to getting into entanglements with those competitors who are polling lower. “This is a two-horse race. If there’s a third, it’s Joe Biden,” said a person with knowledge of the DeSantis political strategy. As for Trump, DeSantis plans to continue to choose his spots, rather than taking a scorched-earth approach to a front-runner whose base will be key to Republican hopes of winning the 2024 general election. Though DeSantis' poll numbers have flagged in recent months — and Trump is above 50% in most national surveys — he is expected to raise more than enough money to build a competitive campaign. The pro-DeSantis super PAC Never Back Down is planning for a $200 million budget and promising to hire 2,600 field operatives across the country, figures that political strategists in both parties consider staggering. “He’s definitely a viable candidate,” said former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who lost his bid for the 2016 GOP nomination. “But the question is: Did he already peak? Has he peaked? If you’re spending all your time answering if you’re likable or not, that’s not a good sign.” While DeSantis is concerning himself mostly with introducing himself to voters and drawing contrasts with Trump, the super PAC has demonstrated a willingness to provide air cover by dropping bombs on the field. In one instance, Never Back Down referred to Haley in a tweet as ""Mickey Haley"" after she criticized DeSantis over his fight with Disney. DeSantis joins the campaign in a clear second place. A CNN poll released Wednesday showed Trump at 53%, DeSantis at 26% and Haley tied with former Vice President Mike Pence, who has said he will make a decision about running next month, at 6%. None of the other seven candidates and potential candidates finished above 2% each. That survey, which largely tracks other recent polls, puts DeSantis a bit closer to Pence and Haley than to Trump. Though he just launched his candidacy in a glitchy Twitter Spaces conversation with billionaire Elon Musk, DeSantis has effectively been campaigning for more than two months. He's visited early primary states and raised money for state parties under the auspices of a book tour and nonprofit policy group. During that time, as constant media coverage has made him a household name for Republican primary voters, his standing in national poll averages has fallen. More troublesome for him and the rest of the field, Trump has surged from a plurality candidate to one who regularly wins the majority of primary voters in polls. Kevin Madden, an adviser on 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney's campaign, said DeSantis will have a chance to make his case to voters in part because he is already capable of getting ""roadblock coverage"" of his campaign events — an asset that candidates such as Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy don't have right now. DeSantis’ political team is planning to lean into his accomplishments as governor, including his against-the-grain approach to Covid, his actions on immigration and his signing of controversial measures — including the so-called Don't Say Gay law, an expansion of the policy and a six-week abortion ban. The DeSantis team believes the governor has “a really, really robust record to run on,” the person familiar with his strategy said. One of Trump’s weaknesses that’s predicted to be exposed in the course of the campaign, according to the person close to the DeSantis team, is the fact that Biden has, through executive order and otherwise, quickly unwound many of Trump’s actions as president. That goes directly against Trump’s contention that he needs four more years to “finish the job.” Freed of the shackles of a shadow campaign, DeSantis must also now cut into Trump’s base and capture support from the pack. ""He’s going to have to have this race become a race between him and Donald Trump,"" Madden said. ""The challenge for him is when to really engage in a full frontal assault because Trump, you know, it’s inevitable that he has to take on Trump and you want to do that more on your own terms than on Trump’s terms."" If polls are accurate, any other candidate would have to swipe votes from Trump to win — a dynamic that wasn't apparent when he held plurality support and some Republicans theorized that a consensus challenger could take the nomination by consolidating anti-Trump voters. Trump won't make that easy. For months, he has been ripping into DeSantis on policy grounds — particularly over proposed entitlement cuts he voted for in Congress as a U.S. representative — and in personal ways. ""[H]e desperately needs a personality transplant,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday, ""and, to the best of my knowledge, they are not medically available yet."" Trump added that DeSantis, who won the governorship with his  backing in 2018, is a ""disloyal person."" The former president's aides say DeSantis will have a difficult time navigating between Trump and the rest of the field. ""You have a crowded and ever-growing-more-crowded field,"" one Trump aide said, ""and everybody's going to be looking to take a shot at Ron DeSantis."" "
"With DeSantis event, Twitter solidifies its place in the conservative media world",David Ingram,"May 25, 2023, 12:30 AM UTC",Social Media,"Elon Musk’s claims that he'd bring political balance to Twitter were already under heavy scrutiny given his ongoing embrace of Republican politicians and far-right politics. Now, after joining Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as he announced his presidential bid, the idea has taken hold among the left that Twitter is just another part of the conservative media apparatus. Democratic strategists said the joint Musk-DeSantis event was only the latest example of the tech billionaire aligning himself and Twitter with increasingly conservative politics in a rightward shift from the San Francisco company’s previous identity. Technical problems marred the start of Wednesday’s event, delaying DeSantis’ introduction by about 20 minutes, but the candidate seemed satisfied by the end. The roughly hour-long event featured a series of people tapped to ask questions, all of whom were well-known conservative pundits and operatives who almost universally fawned over DeSantis. And those questions almost entirely centered on GOP culture war politics: Covid lockdowns, government overreach, the mainstream media, immigration, critical race theory and even bitcoin regulation. “We should do it again,” DeSantis said after taking questions for an hour. “This is a great platform. I would like to see other platforms going in the same direction.” Musk said he’d be open to similar events with Democrats, including President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and reiterated his call after the DeSantis event. That idea landed with a thud among some political consultants. “I can’t fathom we’ll be seeing a Democrat doing a Twitter event any time soon,” said Teddy Goff, the digital director for former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. “Not only is the brand increasingly toxic, but there are fewer people there — and fewer of our people there,” Goff said. The event was lauded on Twitter by some conservatives, as chronicled by Christina Pushaw, DeSantis’ rapid response director. Even the technical glitches were embraced as a sign of the candidate’s strength. “DeSantis broke the Internet!” tweeted conspiracy theorist and right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich. Faiz Shakir, a political adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Twitter is still valuable for reaching certain audiences, including journalists and hyper-engaged voters, but he said candidates are better off trying to create authentic moments with regular people — not chitchat with billionaires. “The things that are going well — that get across — is when people feel like they aren’t getting information that’s canned,” he said. The DeSantis-Musk event was by far the furthest that a major tech platform had gone to identify itself with one particular political party or candidate, shattering what had been a mostly uniform effort within Big Tech to keep their companies neutral at least in perception if not practice. Musk has not endorsed DeSantis or anyone else for president. He has, though, offered some early views on the 2024 race. In June 2022, Musk said he was leaning toward DeSantis for president. And a month later, he said that former President Donald Trump ought to “hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.” Tech platforms, including Meta and Google, have employed various strategies to maintain an image of bipartisanship, including donating to both major political parties from their corporate political action committees as well as hiring both Democratic and Republican former congressional staffers as lobbyists in Washington, D.C. And although many tech barons have personally backed individual politicians, Musk has been steering Twitter’s business in a steadily more partisan direction, academic researchers said. “Because he’s the owner of Twitter, it’s Twitter not Elon Musk that is staging this event,” said Michael Santoro, a business professor at Santa Clara University. “He’s undermining the supposed neutrality of the way Twitter operates,” Santoro said. Before Musk bought Twitter, the tech company, like its competitors, walked a thin line with politicians. Democrats pushed for tougher enforcement of Twitter’s rules, leading to situations like Twitter’s decision in 2017 to bar Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., from buying ads to promote an abortion-related campaign launch video that Twitter said was inflammatory. In 2018, then-CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged the liberal personal leanings of many Twitter employees and intensified his courtship of Republicans with a private dinner in Georgetown, The Washington Post reported. The tightroping rarely satisfied either side. The DeSantis event signals for Twitter and Musk a “pivot to being identified with the Republican Party,” Seth Masket, a professor of political science at the University of Denver and director of its Center on American Politics, said in a Substack post. Masket said in an interview that previous Twitter management appeared to struggle with how best to respond to complaints from conservatives, but he said Musk’s overall vision isn’t entirely clear either. “I don’t get the impression that he’s quite aiming to be an alternative to Fox,” Masket said. “I think he has a particular vision of free speech — that I’ve never gotten the impression is very well thought through, but is the freedom to state controversial viewpoints without a lot of criticism.” Musk’s presence on the audio-only Twitter Spaces event all but ensured a much larger megaphone for DeSantis than the governor would otherwise have had for an announcement on social media. It also was a sign to Musk’s rabid fanbase that the tech billionaire was at least curious to hear DeSantis’ pitch. The event follows other moves by Musk to embrace right-wing politics. He has personally applauded former Fox News host Tucker Carlson for planning a show on the platform and reinstated the accounts of Trump and others banished by Twitter’s previous management. The DeSantis event fits a pattern, progressives said. “This is one of several ways that Musk is trying to reposition Twitter as a new media platform for Republicans,” said Matthew Sheffield, a formerly conservative online writer who now edits a progressive site, Flux. And in posts from Musk’s own account, Musk has attacked liberals such as George Soros in ways widely seen as antisemitic and spread memes associated with white supremacy — all while ensuring that his posts and those of people willing to pay a monthly fee get priority in people’s Twitter feeds. “What we’re seeing is Twitter becoming Elon Musk’s blog. He’s the editor in chief,” Shakir said. “That’s the way that we should look at Twitter. The problem is that Twitter has become too powerful and too large,” he said. Musk bought Twitter in November for $44 billion and quickly moved to remake both the company and its service, laying off most Twitter employees and loosening rules on objectionable content such as hate symbols. Katie Harbath, a former director of public policy at Facebook who previously worked on Republican campaigns, wrote in a Substack post that there was no precedent for Musk playing such a prominent role in the DeSantis kickoff, though she wrote it did remind her of Democrat John Edwards announcing his presidential run on YouTube in 2007. But she wrote that Republicans should generally be wary of Musk. “Musk is not necessarily the Republican’s friend,” she wrote. “Musk is opportunistic and aligns somewhat with the Republicans, but that is advantageous to him right now. The minute it no longer is, Republicans shouldn’t expect any kind of loyalty.” Goff, the former Obama campaign staffer, said Musk doesn’t seem to value long-term relationships with Democrats, either. “Digging himself into an even bigger ditch with a political party that is going to be in power for some period of his lifetime is not a great strategy,” he said. Musk’s businesses are heavily regulated by the federal government. SpaceX enjoys vast revenue from federal contracts, Tesla is under Justice Department investigation, and Twitter’s future depends on Congress not repealing its immunity from many lawsuits. Shakir said that Democrats and progressives can’t exactly ignore or boycott Twitter the way they sometimes do Fox News. Twitter still has a core of politically aware users, including many journalists who have no similar platform to turn to, reflecting what Shakir said is a troubling concentration of economic and political power by tech companies more generally. “It’s become a utility resource for so many consumers of information that his ability to alter the algorithms has incredible power and reach,” Shakir said.

Biden picks history-making Air Force fighter pilot to serve as next Joint Chiefs chairman,The Associated Press,"May 25, 2023, 12:09 AM UTC",Joe Biden,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will announce Thursday that he is tapping Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., a history-making fighter pilot with deep knowledge of China, to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown’s confirmation would mean that, for the first time, both the Pentagon’s top military and civilian positions would be held by African Americans. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the first Black Pentagon chief, has been in the job since the beginning of the administration. The only other Black person to serve as Joint Chiefs chairman was Army Gen. Colin Powell. The nomination has been long expected. If confirmed by the Senate, Brown would replace Army Gen. Mark Milley, whose term ends in October, as the nation’s next top military officer. The president plans to unveil Brown as his pick during a Rose Garden event Thursday afternoon. Biden saw Brown as the right person for the job because of his work modernizing the U.S. fleet of aircraft and its nuclear arsenal and his years of experience in shaping U.S. defenses to meet China’s rise, a senior administration official said. He’s also been deeply involved in the Pentagon’s efforts to equip Ukraine with billions of dollars in U.S. weaponry as Kyiv tries to fend off Russia’s 15-month old invasion. Brown has commanded at every possible level in the Air Force and in joint commands, including in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. He also helped build and lead the U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State militant group. Brown is a career F-16 fighter pilot with more than 3,000 flight hours and command experience at all levels. He has broken barriers throughout his career. He served as the military’s first Black Pacific Air Forces commander, where he led the nation’s air strategy to counter China in the Indo-Pacific as Beijing rapidly militarized islands in the South China Sea and tested its bomber reach with flights near Guam. Three years ago he became the first Black Air Force chief of staff, the service’s top military officer, which also made him the first African American to lead any of the military branches. For the last year Brown has been widely viewed as the frontrunner to replace Milley, as the Pentagon shifts from preparing for the major land wars of the past to deterring a potential future conflict with Beijing. That effort could depend heavily upon the military’s ability to rapidly meet China’s rise in cyberwar, space, nuclear weapons and hypersonics, all areas Brown has sharply focused on for the last several years as the Air Force’s top military leader, in order to modernize U.S. airpower for a 21st century fight. Brown’s confirmation, however, could be delayed. Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville has been blocking military nominations due to his objections over the Pentagon’s policy that provides travel funds and support for troops and dependents to seek a range of reproductive health care, including abortions, if they are based in states where they are now illegal. The Joint Chiefs chairman is the highest-ranking officer in the country and serves as the senior military adviser to the president, the defense secretary and the National Security Council. The chairman commands no troops and is not formally in the chain of command. But the chairman plays a critical role in all major military issues, from policy decisions to advice on major combat operations, and leads meetings with all the joint chiefs who head the various armed services. As Air Force chief, Brown has pushed to modernize U.S. nuclear capabilities, including the soon-to-fly next-generation stealth bomber, and led the effort to shed aging warplanes so there’s funding to move forward with a new fleet of unmanned systems. He’s also supported the development of the U.S. Space Force, which received many of its first Guardians and capabilities from the Air Force. "
A glass of wine and a laughing-crying emoji: Trump team trolls Ron DeSantis launch,Jonathan Allen,"May 24, 2023, 11:58 PM UTC",2024 Election,"WASHINGTON — No one liked Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign launch more than former President Donald Trump. ""Wow. The DeSanctus TWITTER launch is a DISASTER!"" Trump wrote on the Truth Social media platform. ""His whole campaign will be a disaster. WATCH!"" Schadenfreude — the German word for taking pleasure in another's failure — might understate the glee Trump and his team felt as DeSantis' glitch-ridden Twitter audio-chat with billionaire SpaceX founder Elon Musk failed to lift off for about 20 minutes. As hundreds of thousands of listeners logged off, Trump allies shared images to represent their excitement: a glass of wine and a laughing-to-tears emoji among them. Trump quickly posted a video to Truth Social that showed contrasting images of his boisterous campaign announcement last year and a Twitter screen showing the DeSantis discussion ""Preparing to launch."" But Trump advisers also used the moment to argue that the foul-up was reflective of DeSantis and his operation on the whole. ""Glitchy. Tech issues. Uncomfortable silences. A complete failure to launch,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said. ""And that's just the candidate."" Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the pro-Trump political committee Make America Great Again Inc., said in a statement that the episode showed Trump is the right person to win the nomination and the presidency. ""Ron DeSantis’ botched campaign announcement is another example of why he is just not ready for the job,"" Leavitt said. ""The stakes are too high, and the fight to save America is too critical to gamble on a first-timer who is clearly not ready for prime time."" Ultimately, DeSantis and Musk were able to stream their conversation, which was moderated by Musk pal and DeSantis fan David Sacks, over Twitter. DeSantis kicked off by reciting a version of his stump speech that is new to many Americans but familiar to his most ardent supporters. His team portrayed the technological issues as a sign of success, with one senior campaign official saying DeSantis ""broke the Internet."" The launch problem came on the heels of several months of DeSantis watching his poll numbers slide. Trump now consistently claims more than half of Republican primary voters in national polls, and DeSantis' average is closer to 21 percent, according to Real Clear Politics. DeSantis will meet with fundraisers and donors this week in Miami as part of his campaign rollout. "
Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign launch melts down in Twitter glitches,David Ingram,"May 24, 2023, 10:28 PM UTC",2024 Election,"The start of a much-anticipated Twitter event in which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis planned to announce his 2024 Republican presidential bid was repeatedly disrupted Wednesday when Twitter's servers apparently could not handle the surge in traffic. The app crashed repeatedly as Twitter users tried to listen to the event where Twitter owner Elon Musk joined DeSantis for the announcement. DeSantis eventually was able to speak, about 20 minutes after the scheduled start, after Musk closed the initial Twitter Spaces event and started a second one on the app. That space attracted about 161,000 users, according to Twitter’s public-facing data, as DeSantis read a short speech. “I am running for president of the United States to lead our great American comeback,” DeSantis said. The audio-only event, which ultimately lasted over an hour, featured a string of known conservative media figures and operatives praising DeSantis and then posing questions aimed at many of the candidate’s favorite talking points. Dana Loesch, a former spokesperson for the National Rifle Association who is now a radio host, asked DeSantis about pushing back on gun control efforts. She said she planned to vote for DeSantis. The questions and answers stuck closely to culture war topics that are expected to resonate with conservative voters ahead of what's likely to be a brutal primary. DeSantis said he wanted to revisit the government’s response to Covid, in particular mask mandates and school closings; pushed back on claims about book bans while touting his work to ban the teaching of ideas related to critical race theory; and even discussed bitcoin regulation — a topic that the host David Sacks said would resonate with Twitter’s community of bitcoin enthusiasts. Sacks is a major Republican donor who has been openly supportive of DeSantis and is considered to be part of Musk’s inner circle on decisions about Twitter. DeSantis also touched on what is shaping up to be a thorny issue for his campaign: Disney. He defended his ongoing battle with the media and entertainment giant, claiming that the company “obviously supported injecting gender ideology in elementary school” and that he had to draw a bright line. “For 50 years, anytime Disney wanted something in Florida politics, they pretty much got it, but not this time,” he said. DeSantis' entrance into the race immediately sets up a direct confrontation with former President Donald Trump, who since announcing a third bid for the White House in November has regained his status as the leader of the modern Republican Party. Voices early in the Twitter Spaces event were openly concerned Trump would take advantage of the early glitches, a notable admission because the event was set up by DeSantis supporters.' ""This is going to be a stain that Trump is going to leverage for at least a few weeks,"" one person could be heard saying amid the event's early glitches. As the first Twitter Spaces event kicked off, metrics published by Twitter indicated that more than 600,000 were attempting to listen. ""We’ve got so many people here that I think we are kind of melting the servers,"" Sacks said at one point. “We’re reallocating some of the server capability to be able to handle the load here. It’s really going crazy,” Musk said. By the time DeSantis got the moment his political team had spent weeks negotiating, there were fewer than 70,000 viewers remaining, a significantly smaller audience than is traditional for a major presidential campaign launch. Trump aides and allies immediately — and gleefully — mocked the Florida governor for the initial tech fiasco. ""Glitchy. Tech issues. Uncomfortable silences. A complete failure to launch. And that’s just the candidate!"" Steven Cheung, spokesman for former President Donald Trump’s campaign, told NBC News. President Joe Biden’s Twitter account posted a link to his own fundraising page, writing, “This link works.” The DeSantis campaign, however, insisted that the problems showed how many people were flooding Twitter, eager for his campaign. ""Gov. DeSantis broke the internet — that should tell you everything you need to know about the strength of his candidacy,"" a senior campaign official said. ""Groundbreaking announcement. Internet-breaking excitement,"" DeSantis campaign spokesman Dave Abrams added. DeSantis also released a launch video Wednesday evening, saying he was ready to lead a ""Great American Comeback."" ""Our border is a disaster. Crime infests our cities. The federal government makes it harder for families to make ends meet. And the president flounders,"" DeSantis said in the spot. DeSantis' launch remarks also offered a direct critique of the current president, saying Biden ""lacks vigor"" and ""takes his cues from the woke mob."" “Biden has pursued inflationary policies that are hurting working people. We will reverse those policies, and we will build an economy where working American can achieve a good standard of living,” DeSantis said. In a subsequent interview with Fox News, DeSantis was pressed on what he'd prioritize Day One as president. He said he would support national school choice legislation, and declare a national emergency to ""construct the border wall,"" among other things. Some conservative Twitter voices were unconvinced by the launch. One account with the handle @catturd2, which has in recent months risen through the ranks of right-wing Twitter and been amplified in the past by Musk and Trump, had a particularly scathing review. ""I left the Space — It was so terrible and boring I couldn’t take it anymore,"" the account tweeted. ""I’m going to go watch some paint dry so I can be more entertained."" Mick Mulvaney, who served as Trump's chief of staff and has since become vocally critical of his former boss, appeared more impressed, tweeting that DeSantis spent ""75+ minutes on pure policy."" ""Trump could never do that,"" he tweeted. "
House passes measure to block Biden's student debt relief program,Rose Horowitch,"May 24, 2023, 3:20 PM UTC / Updated May 24, 2023, 10:06 PM UTC",Congress,"The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to pass a Republican measure to block President Joe Biden's student debt relief program and end the administration's pause on federal student loan payments. The House voted 218-203, largely along party lines, with two Democrats — Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington — joining Republicans in supporting the measure. The measure faces unlikely odds in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The House resolution would repeal the administration’s program to cancel between $10,000 and $20,000 in loans for borrowers whose income falls below certain levels or who have received a Pell Grant. The legislation would also end a pandemic-era pause on loan payments and interest accrual. Republicans have sharply criticized the Biden administration's program, arguing it burdens taxpayers and is unfair to Americans who have already paid off their loans or who did not attend college. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the program would decrease the federal deficit by about $315 billion in the next decade. The Biden administration, by contrast, has argued that the cost of higher education has become a ""lifelong burden"" on low- and middle-income Americans. The program provides people with ""breathing room"" to repay loans after the pandemic and accompanying economic crisis are over, the administration said in a statement. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., who introduced the legislation in the House, praised its passage in a statement after the vote. ""President Biden’s student loan transfer scheme shifts hundreds of billions of dollars of payments from student loan borrowers onto the backs of the American people,” Good said in a statement. “I am pleased that my Republican colleagues overwhelmingly supported my legislation on the House floor today.” But providing student loan relief has been a key priority for Biden and has helped him marshal support from progressive Democrats. On Monday, the White House warned that Biden would veto the House measure if it makes it to his desk, saying it would ""weaken America's middle class."" Democrats have raised concerns that the House resolution would force people to retroactively make loan payments that had been paused during the pandemic. A Congressional Research Service report on how such measures are implemented says disapproved rules would be ""deemed not to have had any effect at any time, and even provisions that had become effective would be retroactively negated."" Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., ranking member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the resolution would primarily affect people making less than $75,000 per year and that it ""seeks to deny these borrowers the relief they were promised."" ""What's going to happen to all those interest payments that now have to be added back to the loan?"" Scott said on the chamber floor Wednesday, adding that the legislation ""would trigger a wave of delinquencies and defaults for our most vulnerable borrowers.” A representative for Good did not immediately respond to a request for comment about potential retroactive payments. The Congressional Budget Office did not account for such payments in its estimate of the bill's financial impact, leaving it unclear whether the Education Department would interpret the resolution as requiring it to charge people for paused payments. An Education Department spokesperson, responding to a question about retroactive payments, said only that the House resolution “would create immense operational and communication complexities that would seriously harm borrowers.” The House previously voted to block the debt relief program as part of its bill to raise the debt ceiling and cut government spending. But Wednesday's vote was the first time the legislation came to the House floor as a standalone measure. Senate Republicans can use special procedures under the Congressional Review Act to force a vote on the measure even though they are the minority party, and the measure would only need a majority of votes to pass, instead of 60 votes. Still, while 47 Senate Republicans have cosponsored Sen. Bill Cassidy's resolution, it is unclear whether it can gain the majority of votes, requiring Democratic support, that it would need to pass the Senate — and it would not have the supermajority needed to override a presidential veto. Congress is considering the measure as the Supreme Court also weighs in on the Biden administration's program. The high court is poised to soon issue a ruling on whether Biden can continue his plan to cancel some debt for tens of millions of borrowers. "
Bipartisan China panel issues a blueprint to address Taiwan and Uyghur mistreatment,Kyle Stewart,"May 24, 2023, 9:26 PM UTC",Congress,"The bipartisan House select committee on China adopted its first set of policy recommendations Wednesday, focused on how to prevent a military conflict in Taiwan and end the mistreatment of Uyghurs by the Chinese government. The pair of reports, approved unanimously by the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, are intended to serve as a blueprint for action in the 118th Congress. “This is not a comprehensive list of everything that needs to be done,” committee Chairman Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., told NBC News in an interview. “But it is an actionable list of things that we think this Congress can get done and will have a meaningful impact.” The report on Taiwan includes 10 findings and proposals on how to “preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.” Most of the ideas presented concern military readiness in the event China takes aggressive action in the region. The report warns that ""the United States will likely be unready to deter an invasion of Taiwan"" if ""urgent steps"" are not taken. The committee, which was established in January, has so far held multiple hearings, met with business leaders such as Disney CEO  Bob Iger and held a war game tabletop exercise to determine how a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would play out. Members of the committee also traveled with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to California in April to meet Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Gallagher said his strategy in leading the committee was to focus first on human rights abuses before shifting to military and economic concerns. He said he wanted to ""set the tone from the start"" that Congress has ""no quarrel with the Chinese people who are often the primary victims of the CCPs totalitarian repression and aggression."" The reports released Wednesday are ""only a first step,"" Gallagher said in a joint statement with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the top Democrat on the panel. ""And we will continue operating in a bipartisan way to send a message that we are committed to deterrence in the Taiwan Strait and that we won’t turn a blind eye as the CCP commits genocide, 'the crime above all crimes,' against the Uyghur people.” The committee's new report focused on the treatment of ethnic minority Uyghurs found that goods made in forced labor camps in China continue to enter the U.S. despite existing prohibitions. The committee recommended that Congress give the Department of Homeland Security additional resources to strengthen enforcement. As the committee continues its work, Gallagher said, he measures success in two ways. ""One, that we have actually meaningfully impacted our colleagues in terms of explaining to them why they should care about the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party,"" he said. ""But the second thing is on a more practical level is that the committee identifies via these policy recommendations, which then wind up as legislation, we've identified the center of gravity in the 118th Congress when it comes to what we can do to combat CCP aggression in a bipartisan fashion."" One indicator of success early on for Gallagher has been the level of bipartisanship on the committee. ""In most of our hearings, you could have closed your eyes and you wouldn’t have known whether it was a Democrat or Republican speaking,"" he said. ""In fact, we’ve been criticized for being too bipartisan in our approach to China. So that tells me we’re on the right track."" "
Jan. 6 rioter who put his feet on desk in Nancy Pelosi office sentenced to 4.5 years in prison,Dareh Gregorian,"May 24, 2023, 8:51 PM UTC",Capitol riot,"The Arkansas man who was photographed on Jan. 6, 2021, with his feet on a desk in then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office was sentenced Wednesday to four and a half years in prison. Federal prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Richard ""Bigo"" Barnett to more than seven years for his actions before, during and after the riot at the U.S. Capitol. They noted in a court filing that a picture of a smiling Barnett lounging in Pelosi's office became ""one of the best-known images of that day, symbolizing the rioters having wrested control of both the hallowed space and the political process from the nation’s elected leaders."" Barnett's lawyers had argued he shouldn't get more than six months behind bars. ""Mr. Barnett is 63-year-old retired firefighter and bull rider from rural Arkansas who came to DC for his very first time to peacefully protest and was unfortunately caught up in the events that turned an ordinary Wednesday into what will forever be known as 'January 6,'"" his lawyers contended. U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Cooper disagreed, sentencing him to 54 months in prison. Barnett was convicted in January on eight charges stemming from the Capitol attack, including theft of government property and entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon; in addition to the stun device, Barnett armed himself with a ten-pound steel pole, prosecutors said. Barnett became a widely known symbol of the riot when he was photographed reclining in a chair in Pelosi’s office, with his feet propped up, and what the government referred to as a “stun device” tucked in his pants. Before he left Pelosi’s office, Barnett took an envelope that he later displayed for cameras outside the Capitol. He also acknowledged leaving what he later called a “nasty note” for Pelosi. It read, “Nancy, Bigo was here,” and ended with a sexist expletive to refer to Pelosi. Barnett expressed remorse for his actions when he took the witness stand in his own defense. “I shouldn’t have put my feet on the desk,” Barnett told jurors. “At the time I thought it was funny,” he said, but after reflection, it seems “crass.” After he was convicted, however, he maintained he was the victim of ""political persecution"" and said the jury that convicted him was ""not a jury of my peers.” Prosecutors pushed back on Barnett's claims that he'd been unintentionally swept up by the crowd during the Capitol riot and said in court filings that the evidence was clear that Barnett had come to Washington, D.C., that day looking for a fight. ""Barnett was aware of the significance of January 6, 2021.

Nikki Haley targets transgender influencer during presidential campaign stop,Megan Lebowitz,"May 24, 2023, 8:49 PM UTC",2024 Election,"WASHINGTON — Presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Wednesday took aim at transgender influence Dylan Mulvaney during an event in New Hampshire. ""Anybody know about Dylan Mulvaney, the Bud Light person?"" Haley asked the crowd. ""Make no mistake. That is a guy dressed up like a girl, mocking women. Women don’t act like that, yet you have companies glorifying him,"" Haley continued, misgendering Mulvaney. Mulvaney rose to fame as she chronicled her gender transition in her ""Days of Girlhood"" series on TikTok, where she now has 10.8 million followers. She partnered with Bud Light in an April Instagram post, prompting a right-wing backlash and plummeting sales. This isn't the first time Haley targeted the influencer. At an April town hall at New England College, Haley repeated the line: ""Make no mistake: That is a guy dressed up like a girl making fun of women. Women don't act like that."" Mulvaney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments come as Republican-led efforts to restrict transgender health care and sports participation continue across the country. Last month, the GOP-controlled House passed a bill on a party-line vote that would ban transgender women and girls from competing in female school athletics. ""It is a winning issue across America, standing up for the future women and girls,"" said GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of the legislation in an April press conference. Over a dozen states passed policies banning gender-affirming care for minors, according to the Human Rights Campaign. An estimate found that 30.5% of transgender youth ages 13-17 live in states that passed bans on gender-affirming care, according to the organization, which aims to end discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Just this week, Gov. Jim Pillen, R- Neb., signed a bill restricting gender-affirming health care for people under 19 years old. Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., last week signed a bill banning transition-related care for minors and a bill barring transgender people from using restrooms that align with their gender identities. DeSantis entered the presidential race Wednesday. Other GOP 2024 contenders have also taken up anti-transgender sentiments. In an interview with NBC News earlier this week, presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said he would support ""making sure that women compete against women and men compete against men,"" when asked whether he would support federal legislation banning transgender athletes. Former President Donald Trump said in January that if he is reelected, he would ""revoke"" gender-affirming care for minors and limit protections for all transgender people. ""I will sign a new executive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age,"" Trump said in a January video. Haley announced her 2024 campaign in February. She previously served as South Carolina’s governor and ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration. "
Biden says too many schools have become 'killing fields' since Uvalde shooting,Katherine Doyle,"May 24, 2023, 8:47 PM UTC",White House,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that American schools have turned into ""killing fields"" in the year since a mass shooter gunned down nineteen students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Biden, standing before 21 candles at the base of the White House Grand Staircase, spoke of the grief experienced by the families who lost loved ones and urged Congress to act on guns. Biden said families in Uvalde had pleaded with him to “do something” in the wake of the carnage. “Too many everyday places have become killing fields in communities across America,” Biden said in somber remarks marking the anniversary of the shooting. “And in each place, we hear the same message: 'Do something. 'For God’s sake, just do something.” Biden appealed to federal and state lawmakers to enact “common sense gun safety laws” to “keep weapons of war off our streets and out of the hands of dangerous people,” and said it was time to put an end to immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. “How many more mothers will live their worst nightmare before we stand up the gun lobby?” Biden asked, before mounting a call to put partisan politics aside. “It’s time to act. It’s time to make our voices heard. Not as Democrats or Republicans. But as friends, neighbors, parents — and as fellow Americans.” Salvador Ramos, an 18-year-old former student, entered the elementary school building through an unlocked door before turning a semi-automatic-style gun on two adjoining classrooms in one of the most deadly school shootings the U.S. has seen. Officers who arrived at the school did not confront the gunman and instead stood in a hallway outside for more than 45 minutes, according to accounts of the attack and surveillance video. More than seventy minutes had passed by the time U.S. Border Patrol burst into a fourth-grade classroom. The delay amid a sizable law enforcement response, with personnel from agencies that included the Texas Department of Public Safety, U.S. Border Patrol, and local police all on the scene, prompted immediate calls for accountability from local and state officials and parents of the victims. Still, it wasn’t until October that the Uvalde school district said it would suspend its police department and an officer at the scene became the first member of the force to be fired in the fallout. A month later, Uvalde's acting police chief stepped down. "
Ron DeSantis signs law clearing the path for his presidential run,Matt Dixon,"May 24, 2023, 8:42 PM UTC",2024 Election,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a sweeping elections bill Wednesday that will make it easier for him to run for president, a move that comes hours after he formally filed to make a bid for the White House. The most discussed provision in the election package is a change to the state's ""resign-to-run"" law. It was unclear if the change was needed to allow DeSantis to continue to be governor of the third-largest state in the country while simultaneously running for president, but Republican legislative leaders have long said they would change it to ensure there were no legal concerns. DeSantis quietly signed the bill Wednesday, with no fanfare, hours before his formal presidential launch, which will come in during an interview with Twitter owner Elon Musk during a 6 p.m. ET Twitter Spaces event on Wednesday. His office did not respond to requests seeking comment. The resign-to-run changes are among a handful Republican lawmakers passed that will make it easier for DeSantis to run for president. They also created exemptions to state public records laws to make DeSantis’ travel and potential donor meetings more opaque, and, in a last-minute move, gave him an additional $1 million for staff raises to help keep his core team together ahead of a likely presidential run. The resign-to-run proposal became the subject of early attacks from former President Donald Trump, who is the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination by a wide margin, according to several recent public polls. “I couldn’t care less if Ron DeSanctus runs, but the problem is the bill he is about to sign, which allows him to run without resigning from being governor, totally weakens election integrity in Florida,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on April 30. “Instead of getting tough, and doing what the people want (same day voting, voter id, proof of citizenship, paper ballots, hand count etc.) the bill guts everything.” Trump has tried to frame the underlying bill, which includes several Florida election law changes, as DeSantis weakening “election integrity,” a term that has become a mainstay in the conservative lexicon when discussing election reforms. Florida, for three years in a row, has passed sweeping election bills that have prompted lawsuits and concerns of voter suppression from Democrats and voting rights groups. SB 7050, the legislation that includes the resign-to-run provision, also includes, among other things, increasing the total annual fine from $50,000 to $250,000 that the state can levy on outside voter registration groups for infractions like late-filed registration applications, or using people who have felonies on their records or cannot prove they are United States citizens as part of voter registration drives. Heavier penalties for voter registration groups, opponents charge, will disproportionately affect registration of minority voters, who are generally Democratic-leaning. “Black and Hispanic voters are five times more likely to be registered to vote by these organizations than white voters,” Kirk Bailey, political director of the ACLU of Florida, said in a statement. “Lawmakers know this is a bill that would disproportionately impact many Black and brown Floridians who rely on community-based groups to keep them updated on voting rules, which are already difficult to understand.” The resign-to-run provision tucked into that larger election bill has been a central focus as a DeSantis’ bid for president came into closer view, but a Republican-led Legislature signed off on several other changes that will make it harder to track DeSantis’ official actions. Separate legislation would allow DeSantis’ use of state planes to be secret, a move viewed by Democrats as paving the way for the governor to use the state’s taxpayer-funded plane in a way that’s nearly impossible to track, as is allowed currently under Florida law. The proposal would also apply to legislative leadership and other top government officials, but the focus had been on the implications for DeSantis because of his expected presidential campaign rollout. Republican supporters argued the provision, which would also apply to past travel, is needed for safety reasons. “A very simple bill that is truly about safety and security of our most senior elected officials has become politicized,” Republican House sponsor Jeff Holcomb said just before the bill’s final passage. Democrats, though, charged that the bill is pure politics. “I have seen a lot of bills this session that have been specifically allocated for a single individual who wants to run for president,” said Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani when the House passed the legislation. “And I just don’t think we should bend laws to benefit one individual and their political aspirations.” Separate language in the bill would also shield from public record laws the names of people who visit Florida’s governor’s mansion on issues not related to official government business. In recent weeks, DeSantis has held meetings with potential donors at the mansion ahead of his presidential run. Because the creation of a public records exemption requires a two-thirds vote of both chambers of the state Legislature, the bill’s passage came about only because the GOP holds supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Democrats were in near universal opposition to the bill. The $1 million for salary boosts for top DeSantis staffers was added  as part of what’s informally known as the “sprinkle list,” because such late allocations are seen as sprinkles on top of what at that point is an already mostly finished proposal. Senate budget chief Doug Broxson, a Republican, told reporters the money would allow DeSantis to keep top staffers. “He will be able to keep people that are valuable to him, and they will not be tempted to go to the private sector,” he said.

Ron DeSantis jumps into the 2024 presidential race,Matt Dixon,"May 24, 2023, 6:44 PM UTC",2024 Election,"Ron DeSantis is in. The two-term Florida governor officially filed the paperwork to run for president Wednesday, kicking off his much-anticipated showdown with Donald Trump — the man who helped make his political career but now wants to end it. DeSantis plans to publicly announce his bid Wednesday evening. He will take the unconventional step of launching his campaign on Twitter in a conversation with Elon Musk. The billionaire tech mogul has amassed an intense conservative following since buying Twitter and transforming it into a social media platform more welcoming to right-wing voices — including those who were once banned for spreading disinformation. The discussion will be moderated by David Sacks, a tech entrepreneur who is a Musk confidant and strong DeSantis supporter. Musk’s involvement with DeSantis’ presidential launch was quietly negotiated for weeks by his inner circle of political advisers, and first reported by NBC News. The DeSantis campaign hopes that the star power Musk offers will create a moment to alter trend lines that in recent months have seen Trump build an early advantage in key states across the country. Now that he is formally in the race, DeSantis supporters believe he will quickly be able to regain the energy he built up after his sweeping re-election victory in November. DeSantis began to build a national following in 2020, with his largely hands-off approach to the Covid pandemic, and he continued his growth by putting Florida on the vanguard of the culture war fights that conservative base voters most intensely care about. DeSantis signed several bills focused on cracking down on undocumented immigration, banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors, prohibiting higher education institutions from spending tax dollars on most diversity programs and, most notably, picking a fight with Disney, one of Florida’s biggest employers, over LGBTQ rights. Those policies, which will make up the core of DeSantis’ primary platform, drew intense pushback from Democrats and a wide range of advocates, but were overwhelmingly popular with conservatives, many of whom started referring to DeSantis as “America’s Governor.” It’s that sort of momentum supporters think DeSantis will quickly regain now that he is officially in the race. “He still has momentum from a historic re-election in Florida. Now that he is finally going to be in, it is going to be a reset for this whole campaign,” said Nick Ragone, a St. Louis-based Republican bundler who is raising money for DeSantis. “This is going to be a two-person race, and that’s great news for DeSantis. I think the GOP base is really excited to see him get in the race.” DeSantis last week held a conference call with donors and top supporters to make his case for why he will beat Trump. The roughly 25-minute call, which was first reported by The New York Times, focused a lot on his conservative policy wins in Tallahassee since taking office. “He talked a ton about what he got done and through the Legislature,” a Republican who was on the call told NBC News. “He touched on many things, but if you did a poll of what people remember from that call, it was his pitch about why Trump can’t win.” There is little question that DeSantis’ entrance comes at a pivotal political moment. For most of last year, DeSantis was neck and neck with Trump in public polling, but since that time, the former president has hit DeSantis with near daily attacks. In addition, MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC, has spent more than $15 million on television advertisements mostly attacking DeSantis, a huge sum for a candidate who has not yet formally been in the race. That one-two punch has tarnished some of DeSantis’ shine with the national conservative base. The steady drumbeat has hurt DeSantis in most public polling and created a perception he is entering the presidential contest from a position of weakness. Trump has long taken credit for the Florida governor’s ascent in national politics after his 2018 endorsement helped DeSantis beat a better-known and financed Republican opponent. Strains in the relationship emerged during and after Trump’s unsuccessful re-election campaign when DeSantis contrasted his less-restrictive management of the Covid pandemic with Trump’s approach. Although both favored lockdowns in the early stages, DeSantis moved to quickly reopen Florida and drew criticism for his opposition to mask mandates. DeSantis also has not deeply indulged Trump’s debunked theories that the 2020 election was stolen from him, though he campaigned last year for several strident election-deniers. Though Trump has used withering attacks to stake out his front-runner status, DeSantis does enter the race with some structural advantages. Never Back Down, a pro-DeSantis super PAC, has already raised more than $30 million and hired staff in key states to build a long-haul delegate approach to knocking off Trump. DeSantis himself has proven to be a powerful fundraiser, bringing in more than $200 million for his 2022 re-election campaign, the most by any governor in U.S. history. He has been a huge draw at Republican events across the country, and is preparing a show of force by gathering bundlers in Miami to start quickly raising money on the same day as his launch. ""We are going to be raising hard dollars for the campaign, that's the goal today. Not the super PAC stuff,"" Hal Lambert, who served on the Trump inaugural committee in 2016 but is now supporting DeSantis, told NBC News as he was driving to the Miami event. Lambert said he met with DeSantis about a month ago, and switching to support him after being a major Trump donor was a ""no-brainer."" ""He played college baseball, served in the military, was stationed in Iraq, served in Congress, so he knows how D.C. works,"" he said. ""And he just does not have the same baggage."" DeSantis has spent the first months of this year traveling across the country, ostensibly to promote a book and his “Florida Blueprint.” The trips also allowed him to forge connections with GOP activists in a combination of states that vote early in the primary process and states that send large slates of delegates to the nominating convention. Strong showings in early primary proving grounds such as Iowa and New Hampshire are likely to make or break DeSantis’ presidential ambitions. “This go around, I think Iowa is so crucial. If the former president wins Iowa and wins big, no one is going to stop him for the nomination,” said Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of the socially conservative Family Leader, and an influential GOP Iowa operative. “Iowa might not always pick the primary winner, but it is crucial to narrowing the field.” Vander Plaats, who says he remains friends with Trump but is looking for a new Republican standard-bearer, has met with DeSantis in Tallahassee and says he really likes the governor, but says he is also meeting with most other Republican candidates ahead of his organization’s mid-July presidential summit. In New Hampshire, DeSantis was the keynote speaker at the party’s annual Amos Tuck dinner, and helped raise a record amount for the state party — almost 10 times as much as the dinner usually brings in. Of that, more than $130,000 was raised directly by DeSantis through his donor network, something that did not go unnoticed in the context of his forthcoming primary battle with Trump. “In Trump’s seven years of being president and not being president, he raised zero dollars,” a veteran New Hampshire GOP operative said. “In one night, DeSantis got us $132,500. That is a guy who puts his money where his mouth is.” But plenty of Republicans still aren’t sold on the idea that DeSantis is the one to take down Trump to go up against President Joe Biden, with at least seven other candidates vying for the GOP nomination and others likely to jump in. The continued expansion of the field is seen as helpful to Trump, whose MAGA political base is likely to stick with him no matter what. As a result, the more candidates in the mix, the more DeSantis’ portion of the Republican primary electorate vote is chipped away. Trump has done nothing to downplay analysis that a big field is good for him. He has praised other GOP primary candidates, most recently welcoming the entrance of Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., earlier this week. Other governors, including North Dakota’s Doug Burgum, New Hampshire’s Chris Sununu and Virginia’s Glen Youngkin have also signaled interest in running. Youngkin attracted attention last month when he received a $1 million contribution from billionaire GOP donor Thomas Peterffy, who just days before the contribution said he was reconsidering supporting DeSantis, Politico first reported. “I think it is certainly out there he [Youngkin] has thought about it and people want him to run,” said a Virginia Republican operative with ties to Youngkin’s political operation. “I do not think DeSantis is the powerhouse he was made out to be, and as it becomes clear he is not going to run away with it as the alternative candidate to Trump, you’ll continue to see talk of the field expanding.” MAGA Inc., the pro-Trump super PAC, has also directly made the connection that a growing pool of candidates is a sign of DeSantis’ inability to seal the deal as the top non-Trump candidate. “Ron DeSantis’ failed shadow campaign has opened the floodgates for career politicians looking to seize an opportunity to raise their profile ahead of the 2028 race,” Taylor Budowich, CEO of the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc., said Friday in a response to Scott’s campaign filing. “Tim Scott’s entrance, and aggressive media purchase, doesn’t only kneecap DeSantis, but Scott sees the same thing as Youngkin, Sununu, Burgum, Christie and others: the path to second place is wide open.” "
Texas says phone app encourages illegal border crossings in suit against Biden administration,Associated Press,"May 24, 2023, 6:32 PM UTC",Immigration,"The state of Texas is suing the Biden administration in an attempt to have a newly-introduced asylum rule thrown out, saying a phone app used by migrants to set up appointments at the border to seek entry into the United States is encouraging illegal immigration. The lawsuit filed Tuesday is the latest legal salvo attacking various aspects of the administration’s plan to manage migration in the aftermath of the end of a key pandemic-era immigration regulation called Title 42. In the lawsuit, Texas argues that the asylum rule encourages the use of a cellphone app — called CBP One — for migrants who don’t have proper documentation to make an appointment to come to a port of entry and seek entry into the United States. Texas argues the Biden administration is essentially encouraging people to come to the U.S. even though they don’t have legal basis to stay. “The Biden Administration deliberately conceived of this phone app with the goal of illegally pre-approving more foreign aliens to enter the country and go where they please once they arrive,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a news release. In a statement Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said Texas’ lawsuit would actually create disorder, not alleviate it and that the app was part of measures that have helped reduce unlawful immigration by more than 70% since Title 42 ended. “Lawful pathways like making an appointment to appear at a port of entry using the CBP One app allow us to process migrants in a safe, orderly, and humane way and reduce unlawful immigration. This is particularly critical at a time when Congress has failed to reform our broken immigration system,” the department said. While the lawsuit focuses on the phone app, it seeks to throw out the entire asylum rule, called the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways. The rule went into effect when Title 42 expired May 11. The rule makes it extremely difficult for migrants who travel to the southern border to get asylum if they don’t first seek protection in a country they passed through before reaching the U.S. or if they don’t apply online through the app. Use of the app is a core part of the administration’s plans to create a more orderly system at the border where migrants set up appointments ahead of time. When the app was rolled out in January, it was criticized for technological problems and because demand has far outstripped available spaces. Migrants can make appointments for specific ports of entry — five of which are in Texas. Texas argues that according to federal law, people entering the country illegally — with rare exceptions — should be expelled but that the app doesn’t verify whether the migrants seeking appointments would qualify for exceptions. Therefore, the state argues, the Biden administration’s use of the app essentially encourages people to come to the U.S. even if they don’t qualify. Texas also argues that it has to pay the financial burden of migrants coming to the U.S. through things like health care or education. The new asylum rule has also been attacked by rights groups who argue the U.S. has an obligation to offer asylum to those in desperate need. They’re suing to have the rule thrown out as well. Texas is also part of another lawsuit accusing the administration of overstepping its authority by allowing as many as 360,000 people a year from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to enter the U.S. under its humanitarian parole authority.

"DHS warns of attacks against government buildings, minority groups ahead of 2024 election",Julia Ainsley,"May 24, 2023, 6:27 PM UTC",News,"The Department of Homeland Security is warning about the potential for violence in the lead-up to the 2024 election cycle that could target the nation's critical infrastructure, faith-based institutions, government facilities and minority communities, according to a bulletin posted Wednesday. “In the coming months, DHS expects the threat environment to remain heightened and that individuals may be motivated to violence by perceptions of the 2024 general election cycle,” the National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin said, adding that “legislative or judicial decisions pertaining to sociopolitical issues” may also motivate attackers. Those perceptions, according to senior DHS officials, may arise if misinformation spreads in 2024, as it did in 2020, that the U.S. election system is rigged or flawed. The new bulletin, released as a previous bulletin outlining the terrorism threat landscape was due to expire, points to recent incidents and public online communications to take a pulse of the current and most threatening terror threats in the United States. Among those recent events was the May 6 mass shooting in Allen, Texas, in which the attacker “held views consistent with racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism.” The agency has now issued eight bulletins since January 2021, the month of the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. On a call with reporters Wednesday, senior DHS officials said recent charges and sentences against the perpetrators of the Jan. 6 riot may be serving to dissuade similar violence in the future. One official noted that recent events expected to be violent turned out to be small and peaceful, perhaps because would-be attackers feared they would be arrested and prosecuted. The bulletin states the U.S. remains in a “heightened threat environment.” “Recent tragic events highlight the continued heightened threat environment our nation faces, and these threats are driven by violent extremists who seek to further their ideological beliefs and personal grievances,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement on the bulletin. “We are working with partners across every level of government, within the private sector, and in local communities to keep Americans safe. We will continue to share information and intelligence, equip communities with training and resources, and fund security enhancement and prevention efforts through millions of dollars in grant funding.” Other potential targets of violence include schools, racial and ethnic minorities, individuals or events associated with the LGBTQ+ community, government personnel and law enforcement, the bulletin said. Potential attackers could include both domestic violent extremists and those motivated by the ideology of foreign terrorist organizations, groups whose influence made up the vast majority of the terror threat in the U.S. following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Texas GOP leaders in feud over alleged drinking on the job and ‘illegal conduct’,Summer Concepcion,"May 24, 2023, 6:23 PM UTC",Politics News,"Infighting among top Texas Republicans spilled out into plain view after Attorney General Ken Paxton called on the state’s House speaker to step down over accusations that he was drunk during legislative proceedings — allegations that came a day before the chamber heard testimony about the criminal accusations against Paxton. Paxton, who remains under indictment over accusations of securities fraud charges from 2015, accused Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan of being “in a state of apparent debilitating intoxication” on the job after a video of Phelan appearing to slur his speech while presiding over the chamber Friday went viral. “After much consideration, it is with profound disappointment that I call on Speaker Dade Phelan to resign at the end of this legislative session,” Paxton said in a statement Tuesday. “Texans were dismayed to witness his performance presiding over the Texas House in a state of apparent debilitating intoxication. His conduct has negatively impacted the legislative process and constitutes a failure to live up to his duty to the public.” Later Tuesday, Paxton posted an image of a letter asking the House General Investigating Committee to look into Phelan’s “conduct unbecoming his position.” In a statement, Phelan’s spokesperson, Cait Wittman, characterized Paxton’s allegations as politically motivated, noting that the House General Investigating Committee has been investigating “events tied to the firing of the whistleblowers in addition to Ken Paxton’s alleged illegal conduct” since March, according to the Houston Chronicle. “The motives for and timing behind Paxton’s statement today couldn’t be more evident,” Wittman said, the Chronicle reported. “Mr. Paxton’s statement today amounts to little more than a last-ditch effort to save face.” The GOP-led committee met Wednesday to discuss the allegations against Paxton, with investigators telling the panel there was evidence that the state attorney general had repeatedly broke the law the years, including misuse of official information, abuse of official capacity and retaliation, according to the Associated Press. Paxton was sued by four of his former aides in 2020. They alleged that he fired them in retaliation for reporting him to federal law enforcement for allegedly taking bribes and using his office to help one of his campaign contributors. The parties reached a settlement of $3.3 million in the lawsuit, but the Texas Legislature has not agreed to fund it using taxpayer dollars. Phelan previously voiced opposition to Paxton’s request for the state to pay $3.3 million to settle the lawsuit. “I don’t think it’s the proper use of taxpayer dollars,” Phelan said during an interview in February. Paxton pleaded not guilty to the charges from 2015, which still have not gone to trial. He also made no admission of wrongdoing to the accusations of bribery and abuse of office, which he has denied for years and called politically motivated. His and Phelan’s offices did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment on Paxton's allegations against Phelan and the House committee's investigation of Paxton. "
The NAACP’s Florida travel advisory is less about traveling and more about Black voters,Curtis Bunn,"May 24, 2023, 5:26 PM UTC",NBCBLK,"The NAACP’s travel advisory for Black people considering a visit or move to Florida has less to do with potential travelers and more to do with rallying the Black residents of the state to counter Republican-led policies, members of the civil rights organization told NBC News. Leon W. Russell, the chairman of the NAACP national board of directors, who lives in Tampa, said the travel advisory was an informational and strategic tactic to galvanize Black voters, especially Black men, against Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. “Let me be clear: We’re not calling for a boycott or a travel ban,” Russell said. “We’re saying to Black people who come to the state or who are thinking about coming to the state that you need to be aware of what’s going on here and you need to think about how you are going to be impacted by this hate and cruelty that is being generated. You need to consider whether or not you’re going to be safe.” The advisory reads, “Florida is openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals. Before traveling to Florida, please understand that the state of Florida devalues and marginalizes the contributions of, and the challenges faced by African Americans and other communities of color.” Marsha Ellison, president of the NAACP's Fort Lauderdale/Broward Branch, said the advisory has already generated interest. “Since the travel advisory, our phones have been blowing up with people on the ground wanting to know more details about why the travel advisory and the policies that impact them,” she said. “So, this is going to be quite effective.” Ellison said many Black Floridians have a strong sense of DeSantis’ policies related to race, identity and inclusion, and “many aren’t in tune with his racist and draconian policies.” DeSantis has said Florida is where “woke goes to die.” He doubled down on his comment in January when his administration said it would block a new Advanced Placement African American studies course from being taught in public high schools, prompting some Black parents to say they will teach the history at home to assure their children are well versed. DeSantis also has been vocal about banning the teaching of critical race theory in public schools and about other policies that some consider to be  anti-gay or anti-immigration. The advisory, Russell said, stands for multiple and intersecting marginalized communities. “If you are a part of any of these communities — Black, Latino, LGBTQ — or if you stand in support of these communities, you need to work with us to think about a proactive civic engagement policy because this, at the end of the day, is about politics,” he said. Millions of people flock to Florida for its beaches and attractions, but the politics have driven not only the NAACP but also the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Equality Florida and the Human Rights Campaign to issue similar travel advisories or relocation warnings. In a statement released to the media, the DeSantis administration said Florida was flourishing in tourism and called the NAACP travel advisory “nothing more than a stunt.” DeSantis is planning to announce his presidential campaign this week. “You can’t get blinded by the tourism piece,” Ellison said. “We are opening people’s eyes as far as what’s really happening. This man is running for president. Florida may seem so far away to other people. But when you think about it, it could be happening in other places, you understand the importance. Black history means something to all of us, and we can’t let it be wiped away.” And so, the NAACP is all in on fighting against DeSantis. Russell said  his policies “are about one man’s thirst for power.” This is the most effective political action plan, civic engagement plan that the association has ever conducted in the state of Florida. It’s clear to us that you can’t run away from hate, right? You have to fight it.” Russell called on Black men, specifically. “You have to get out and vote. You have to encourage your brothers to get out and vote because policies will kill you if you don’t,” he said. Further, Russell said DeSantis’ public vows to erase the teaching of Black history in Florida public schools has worked opposite his intentions. While it has garnered much state and national attention, Black voters are hearing the messages — and are riled up about it. “I am heartened by the fact that he’s done the opposite of what he set out to do,” Russell said. “He wanted to kill ‘wokeness.’ But he’s actually raised the level of people’s awareness. People are realizing the cruelty that’s being spread. I think he is waking people up to the fact that they need to stand up, that they need to be a part of something. And that’s what we hope to create is a civic engagement movement with the travel advisory. The more people know, the more they will act.” He cited the mayoral race in Jacksonville last week as an example. Democrat Donna Deegan was an underdog in a city that DeSantis won in his 2022 race by 12 points. The governor backed conservative Daniel Davis, who had run on an agenda similar to DeSantis’. Deegan pulled off the stunning upset. “And you can point to the attack by her opponent on the LGBTQ community, the attack on the Black community, for the turnout that changed that situation. Awareness,” Russell said. But Russell admitted that far more is needed in Florida to have the impact the NAACP is seeking. “We need to flip some seats in the state Legislature,” he said. “We have to show public policymakers that the voters are aware of what’s going on and who is setting this policy, and we have to organize folks so that we change who’s in public policymaking positions in the state — whether it’s at the legislative level, whether it’s at the school board level, because some of the biggest threats right now are happening at school board level. “And city council and mayoral positions. So, this advisory is a way to heighten awareness about the issues so we can motivate people to get out and get active and to vote. That’s where the change happens.” "
"America’s nuclear secrets are vulnerable to fraudsters and spies, watchdog report says",Ken Dilanian,"May 24, 2023, 3:42 PM UTC",News,"A new watchdog report says the federal agency that keeps the nation’s nuclear secrets has failed to establish an “insider threat” program to guard against fraudsters, leakers and spies in its midst, a decade after a presidential order to do so. The bluntly-worded report by the Government Accountability Office says the Energy Department has for years failed to act on recommendations from four independent reviewers pointing to gaping holes in its efforts to create an insider threat program. And it notes that it in 2017, the most recent year data was available, there were about 250 unclassified insider threat-related security incidents, including sending classified information over unclassified systems, leaving security areas unattended and not properly protecting classified information. There were also several malicious incidents, the report notes, including a nuclear safety program manager sentenced to 18 months in prison for accepting almost $500,000 in bribes in exchange for official acts. “The theft of nuclear material and the compromise of information could have devastating consequences,” the GAO said. “Threats can come from external adversaries or from ‘insiders,’ including employees or visitors with trusted access… Such threats could have significant consequences for national security and could include unauthorized release of classified information; workplace violence; or improper access to sensitive nuclear weapons, material.” The GAO report comes after NBC News reported exclusively last year that at least 154 Chinese scientists who worked on government-sponsored research at the Energy Department’s Los Alamos National Laboratory over the last two decades have been recruited to do scientific work in China — some of which helped advance military technology that threatens America's national security. A report by Strider Technologies described what it calls a systemic effort by the Chinese government to place Chinese scientists at Los Alamos, where nuclear weapons were first developed.  Many of the scientists were later lured back to China to help make advances in such technologies as deep-earth-penetrating warheads, hypersonic missiles, quiet submarines and drones, according to the report. It  said the scientists were paid as much as $1 million through participation in Beijing's “talent programs,” designed to recruit Chinese scientists to return to the Asian country. A former Los Alamos scientist pleaded guilty in 2020 to lying about his involvement in a Chinese recruitment program, but most of the conduct described in the report appears to have been legal. The kind of technology transfer described in the Strider report is among the risks that insider threat programs are designed to mitigate. In a written response included in the GAO report, the Energy Department said it agreed with all the recommendations, and made a series of promises to essentially do better. An Energy Department spokesperson said it has ""a highly vetted workforce and maintains programs specifically designed to avoid or minimize insider threats while capitalizing on longstanding protection measures against misuse of critical stockpile assets and resources."" ""We appreciate the GAO’s review and have taken a series of actions to further bolster the Department’s capabilities to effectively deter, detect, and mitigate insider threats throughout the nuclear enterprise,"" the spokesperson added. The Energy Department has more than 13,000 employees and a network of contractors employing 120,000, the report says, and a significant percentage of those people hold security clearances. In 2011, after an Army private leaked tens of thousands of sensitive documents, the government moved to require that all agencies set up an insider threat program. "
"3 dead and 9 injured after man stabs and strikes random victims in California ‘crime spree,’ police say",Dennis Romero,"June 3, 2023, 3:39 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Three people were killed and nine others injured when a man randomly stabbed and struck victims with a vehicle in the San Jose area, officials said. Kevin Parkourana, 31, of San Jose was in custody in connection with the attacks Thursday, police from San Jose and the adjacent city of Milpitas announced Friday. ""We ended the crime spree,"" Milpitas Police Chief Jared Hernandez said at a news conference Friday. ""We were able to effectively prevent additional people from being injured."" Parkourana was booked on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and carjacking in connection with the violence in both cities, San Jose Police Chief Anthony Mata said at the news conference. The attacks were “random acts of violence, there was no targeting of individuals,” Mata said. Charges have not been formally filed, and the area public defender had no comment. The spree began shortly after 3 p.m. Thursday in San Jose, when the suspect stabbed a victim and carjacked a Honda Odyssey minivan blocks from his own home, local Deputy Chief Steve Lagorio said. That victim was stabilized at a hospital, he said. Roughly 20 minutes later, the suspect ditched the minivan and took another vehicle, a Honda Pilot SUV, by stabbing a motorist in a parking lot in San Jose, Lagorio said. The suspect, behind the wheel, then struck a pedestrian, he said. Both victims were hospitalized and stabilized by medical personnel, Lagorio said. About 4 p.m. the suspect allegedly used the Pilot to strike a vehicle in downtown San Jose, he said. The man then stabbed the motorist inside, Lagorio said. The victim sustained injuries not believed to be life-threatening, he said. Minutes later the suspect, still behind the wheel of the SUV,  ""intentionally struck"" three people near a San Jose intersection, Lagorio said. Two of the three died at the scene, he said. A short time later, the suspect struck a person on a motorized scooter in San Jose, he said. The rider and the third pedestrian struck had non life-threatening injuries, police said. About 4:32 p.m. a stabbing took place at a Smart & Final store parking lot in adjacent Milpitas, and the SUV was found abandoned nearby, police said. The victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, said Hernandez, the Milpitas chief, at the news conference. Officers in the city turned their attention to the Milpitas High School graduation ceremony underway nearby and flooded the area with law enforcement as a precaution, Hernandez said. Tracking dogs alerted to the possibility the suspect was in the area, and at 6:15 p.m. Parkourana emerged from a parked car less than a quarter mile from the Smart & Final and surrendered without incident, Hernandez said. The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner has not released the names of the victims who died. The motive is under investigation. Mata, the San Jose chief, said Parkourana is on probation. Santa Clara County court records show a history of felony and misdemeanor convictions and dismissals since 2018 for the suspect. One of the felony cases with a conviction is described in a court docket as involving family violence. In multiple instances the suspect was ordered to appear in Mental Health Treatment Court, the record shows. An active case involves a petition to revoke his post release community supervision, a program that moves inmates from state custody to local oversight. A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said the institution will not comment while the San Jose and Milpitas cases were still under investigation. San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan said at the Friday news conference that the system of enforcement and justice must be reinforced. ""When we’re dealing with individuals who are repeat offenders with multiple convictions, our city, county, and state must do a better job holding people accountable for getting the care that they need or getting them off of our streets,"" he said.

"She thought her mom's drinking may have killed her — then a convicted murderer confessed, Austin police say",Tim Stelloh,"June 3, 2023, 1:13 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Sonia Houston wasn't sure what had killed her mother four years ago. If anything was to blame, it was probably her drinking, Houston said she believed — until Wednesday. That's when authorities in Austin, Texas, revealed that convicted murderer Raul Meza Jr., 62, had confessed to multiple killings, including the 2019 death of Houston's 66-year-old mother, Gloria Lofton. “Had he not confessed, she would have just been another unknown,” Houston said, putting the blame on authorities for not properly investigating her mother's death. Meza, who had been the subject of a manhunt in the May 20 killing of his 80-year-old roommate, made his admission last month after he called a city hotline and was transferred to a homicide detective, police said. ""My name is Raul Meza, and I think you’re looking for me,” Meza said, according to an affidavit in support of Meza’s arrest filed Wednesday in Travis County District Court. Meza, who served 11 years in prison for the 1982 murder and sexual assault of an 8-year-old girl, has since been accused of murder in both deaths. Austin police say they are looking into links between Meza and as many as 10 unsolved killings dating back to the 1990s. The revelation has left Houston furious with authorities over their handling of the investigation — an inquiry that she said for years offered few answers and appeared to miss potentially key evidence, including a used condom that Houston said she found in her mother’s kitchen. According to the affidavit, authorities accused him in the sexual assault and strangulation of Lofton — an allegation partly supported by a swab taken from Lofton at the time of her death that provided a DNA match to Meza in 2020. Yet in the months after her body was found, the Travis County Medical Examiner listed her cause and manner of death as “undetermined,” according to the affidavit. And Houston said she never heard from authorities again until after Meza told the detective on May 24 that he was responsible for the killing of a “lady” on “Sara Drive.” ""It would have been different if she was white and on the other side"" of Austin, Houston’s older sister, Christina Fultz, said in an interview. ""It would have been solved in a week."" Gloria Lofton was of Mexican descent and lived on Austin's east side. An Austin Police Department spokesperson said in an email that Chief Joseph Chacon was recently made aware of the case's details and had launched an administrative review of ""potential investigative lapses."" The spokesperson declined to comment further. A spokesman for Travis County said he could not comment on how the medical examiner's office reached its conclusion, citing an active investigation. According to the affidavit, one day after Meza's call the medical examiner updated Lofton's manner and cause of death to homicide by strangulation. A lawyer for Meza, who is being held at the Travis County Correctional Complex on a charge of capital murder, did not respond to a request for comment. A motive for Lofton's killing remains unclear. According to the affidavit, Meza told authorities that he had been promised 25% of the money Lofton's nephew would inherit. But Houston said her mother didn't have any nephews. Houston said she has no idea if her mother knew Meza. Houston described her relationship with Lofton as complicated. Her mother was whip-smart, Houston said, and introduced her to books, music and film. Lofton also worked hard doing administrative work, accounting and other clerical jobs to send her daughter to a private Catholic school, Houston said. But Lofton was troubled, Houston said. She'd been mentally and physically abused by men and never addressed what Houston described as the ""demons"" that seemed to fester with age, her daughter said. (Houston said her father, who served in the Army and Air Force, was ""very respectful"" and only stayed with Lofton until their daughter was 4.) Lofton quit working in her late 40s, spent much of her time drinking and moved in with her father, Houston said. She last saw her mother on May 8, 2019, when Lofton dispatched her to buy a pack of cigarettes and beer, she said. Houston said she reluctantly agreed after pressuring her mother to eat. The next day, as Houston returned home, she arrived to police officers who told her of her mother's death, she said. Authorities had found her in her bedroom, naked from the waist down with the two shirts she was wearing pulled above her head, according to the affidavit. They offered few details about what had happened, and after roughly 24 hours, authorities had returned her mother's house keys and said she could return to the home, she said. Houston's older sister, Fultz, went with her to the house. Lofton had given her older daughter up for adoption as a newborn but the sisters became close in the years before Lofton's death. ""We sat outside watching the crime scene people leave with bags and they didn’t say anything to us,"" Fultz recalled. ""They didn't warn us. They didn't say, 'Hey, by the way.'"" ""It was so insensitive,"" Fultz said. ""It was horrifying."" Inside, the sisters found a home that looked like it had been ransacked, Houston said. There was a bloody pillow and blood spatter down the hallway, Houston said. In the kitchen, Fultz said they found lube, a condom and a wrapper inside what appeared to be a detective's latex glove. Houston ran outside and burst into tears, Fultz said, adding: ""It was the worst wail of a cry. All I could do was hug her."" The police department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Despite the scene, Houston came to believe her mother's drinking was likely to blame for her death. ""Did she get drunk and hit her head?"" Houston said. ""She's home alone. Anyone who's been drunk, you know accidents do happen. Did she try to crawl her way into bed?"" Houston was baffled by the autopsy's inconclusive findings, but after Lofton's death she remained focused on laying her mother to rest and sorting out her affairs — not seeking legal advice, as some suggested. Now, she wants justice for her mother. ""They wanted us to solely blame the perpetrator, the criminal, and yes I can say all day long how I feel about Raul,"" she said. ""Karma is a very serious lady."" She added: ""Beyond him, am I supposed to say, they handled this to the best of their abilities? From the looks of it, they didn't."" "
Texas school superintendent arrested in sting in which officers posed as teens,Antonio Planas,"June 2, 2023, 10:30 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A Texas school superintendent sent lewd photos to an undercover officer posing online as a 15-year-old girl he planned to meet with, authorities said. Michael Keith Stevens, 47, superintendent of the Itasca Independent School District, was arrested Thursday and accused of online solicitation of a minor, according to court records. Itasca Independent School District is about 55 miles south of Dallas. Stevens was detained at the Harris County jail Friday afternoon. Online records indicate his bond was set at $100,000. It was not immediately clear if he had retained an attorney. Stevens’ relatives could not immediately be reached for comment. Stevens was one of seven people arrested after an undercover operation with more than a dozen local law enforcement agencies. Officers posed as teens ages 13, 14 and 15 and communicated online, Harris County Precinct 1 Constable Alan Rosen said in a video statement posted on Facebook. Rosen said the school administrator was allegedly communicating with a teen he believed was from Houston. “He sent pictures of his private parts and asked for nude videos and images in return,” The constable said. “He told the undercover investigator he was at work and some of his disturbing photos appear to be taken in his office. And during the conversation, he was planning a trip to Houston to engage in sex acts."" “Stevens has been around children his entire work life. He has been a coach, a principal and an assistant principal in various towns across north Texas. He is married with no children,"" Rosen added. No one with the Itasca schools could be reached for comment Friday. A statement from the school district on its Facebook page said: “On June 1, 2023, the District was contacted by a detective with the Harris County Sheriff’s Department. According to the detective, Superintendent Michael Stevens was taken into custody. Until more facts are confirmed, no further information can be shared. The Board of Trustees will be convening a meeting to review this matter and take appropriate action.” The Itasca district posted a notification for a special meeting on Monday. NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reported Stevens was named superintendent in 2022. Before moving to Hill County, Stevens worked in several Texas districts. In his video statement, Rosen encouraged parents to be vigilant about monitoring their children’s activity online. “These cases should be a wake-up call for parents,” he said. “You must know what your children are doing online. There are apps out there, even on your cellphone, that can help you keep track.” "
Utah parent upset by book bans gets Bible pulled from school shelves to expose ‘bad faith process’,David K. Li,"June 2, 2023, 8:53 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A Utah school district took the Bible off some bookshelves, officials said Friday, following a complaint from a parent upset by book bans who was hoping to expose the ""bad faith process."" The Davis School District — the state's second biggest public system with nearly 74,000 pre-K-to-12th grade students — has largely removed the book from circulation, but kept it in high school libraries. The parent, in a copy of the complaint obtained by NBC News that redacts their identity, said their effort to boot the Bible was in protest of a 2022 Utah law that made it easier to remove “pornographic or indecent” content from schools. The legislation was supported by conservative activist groups, including Utah Parents United. ""I thank the Utah Legislature and Utah Parents United for making this bad faith process so much easier and way more efficient,"" the parent said in the complaint. ""Now we can all ban books and you don’t even need to read them or be accurate about it. Heck, you don’t even need to see the book!"" An eight-page typed list of examples of objectionable material  from the Bible, quoting the exact scriptures, was included in the complaint. ""Incest, onanism, bestiality, prostitution, genital mutilation, fellatio, dildos, rape, and even infanticide,"" the parent wrote. ""You’ll no doubt find that the Bible, under Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-1227, has ‘no serious values for minors’ because it’s pornographic by our new definition."" A district review committee acted on the complaint and examined the King James version of the Bible, with an eye toward Utah codes covering public obscenity, pornography and other inappropriate material, officials said. That committee decided to ""retain the book in school library circulation only at the high school level based on age appropriateness due to vulgarity or violence,"" according to a statement to NBC News on Friday from  Christopher Williams, a spokesman for the district based in Farmington. The committee's decision has been appealed ""by an individual who would like it retained at all levels"" and the matter will be debated by a three-member committee of the district's Board of Education before the full panel finally decides, Williams added. All of these moves, for now, are moot since district students are off for summer vacation until Aug. 17. It's believed only seven or eight libraries in the district's elementary and junior high schools even had the Bible on their shelves and the book is not part of any school curriculum, Williams added. The effort to ban, limit or restrict books at libraries and other public settings is on the rise, according to the American Library Association (ALA). ""ALA opposes censorship of any materials that meet the information needs of a community’s members, including students,"" Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom, said in statement on Friday. ""Librarians have a professional responsibility to be inclusive rather than exclusive in developing their collections, and should address all information concerns of all those who use the library, including their religious information needs. "" Forces seeking to limit access to books should take note of this Utah case to understand the corrosive nature of bans, Caldwell-Stone added. ""The use of Utah’s 'sensitive materials' law to remove this book and other books demonstrates how efforts to suppress and censor library materials narrows educational opportunities and harms students’ access to information,"" according to Caldwell-Stone. ""The curation of library collections for young people should not be left to politicians and advocacy groups who place politics above young peoples’ education needs."" "
At least 7 injured in partial building collapse during concrete pouring mishap near Yale medical school,Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 8:24 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A building under construction near the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven partially collapsed Friday when a concrete pour went awry, injuring at least seven people including two critically, city officials said, adding there were no fatalities. City firefighters and other authorities were called to Lafayette Street shortly after 12:30 p.m. “Our units responded immediately within minutes and found several persons in varying degrees of injury, from broken bones to three that were partially buried under the rubble,” Fire Chief John Alston Jr. said during a news conference. “Those persons that were trapped had to be lifted out.” There were 36 people at the work site at the time, and all were accounted for, officials said. “They were doing a concrete pour on this building and as they were pouring concrete a portion of the second floor collapsed onto the first floor and then into the basement,” Mayor Justin Elicker said. Workers at the site told first responders the concrete was being poured faster than they could spread it, and it pooled too much in one area and caused the collapse, Alston said. Elicker said the property is owned by Yale and is being developed into what will be a seven-story residential building by RMS Companies, based in Stamford, Connecticut, which bills itself as a builder of “upscale, modern apartments and luxurious boutique hotels” on its website. The building is currently two stories high, with two parking levels underground. Plans call for 112 residential units, Elicker said. “There will be a significant investigation as with any construction situation like this,” the mayor said. A person who answered the phone at RMS said the company was not commenting at this time. Investigators with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration were at the scene. City officials said they planned to issue a stop work order at the site until it is safe. Lafayette Street is a short distance from Yale New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of Medicine and is home to several medical offices, about five blocks from the New Haven Green. Alston said city emergency officials had been talking about responding to building collapses in recent days, in response to the partial collapse of an apartment building in Davenport, Iowa, on Sunday that left three people missing and feared dead. “They did some excellent work under some harrowing conditions,” Alston said about New Haven first responders. “I’m very proud of that considering what happened in Iowa recently. We’ve been talking about collapses in our area so they responded admirably.” "
"Oklahoma man suffers hourslong bee attack, leaving him with broken hip and hundreds of stingers in his body",Uwa Ede-Osifo,"June 2, 2023, 6:56 PM UTC",U.S. news,"An Oklahoma man said he was the victim of an hourslong bee attack last Friday, leaving him with a broken hip and over 200 stingers in his body. Carl Amos, 81, was mowing his yard in Maysville when his family said he was swarmed and attacked by what appeared to be “killer bees,"" an aggressive subspecies also known as Africanized bees. “They were going in my hair and going in my ears and in my nose, and I thought I better keep my mouth shut because those bees will be in my mouth,” Amos said in an interview with NBC News affiliate in Oklahoma City KFOR. “I hit some of them with my hands,” he told the outlet. “You just can’t kill ’em fast enough.” Amos tried to run from the bees but fell and injured his leg in the process. “I knew I had broken my leg because I heard it pop, so I thought this is not good,” he told KFOR. He said the bees continued to sting him as he lay on the ground for nearly three hours. A man who worked at a business nearby discovered Amos and called an ambulance. “I feel like I owe him my life,” he told KFOR. Amos was subsequently transported to a local hospital where staff began to remove the bees' stingers, according to a statement posted on GoFundMe from his daughter Heather Garvey. “The hospital has removed over 200 stingers and are still removing them three days later,” Garvey said. “After all this, he is in good spirits but it will be a long road to recovery,” Garvey wrote.

The 8-year-old who died in Border Patrol custody had a 104.9-degree temperature and still was not sent to the hospital,Chantal Da Silva,"June 2, 2023, 11:21 AM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 6:53 PM UTC",Immigration,"A medically fragile 8-year-old girl who died in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol last month suffered a 104.9-degree fever, but was still not taken to a hospital, the day before she died, an internal investigation found. A contracted nurse practitioner also declined to review documents and refused repeated requests for an ambulance from the mother of Anadith Tanay Reyes Álvarez in the hours before the child appeared to suffer a seizure and died on her ninth day in the agency’s custody, according to the internal investigation by Customs and Border Protection. Anadith, who was born in Panama to Honduran parents, entered Brownsville, Texas, with her parents and two siblings on May 9. The following day, the child underwent medical screening as part of the intake process, during which her parents shared the 8-year-old's medical history, including that she had congenital heart disease and sickle cell anemia. Despite her medical history being provided, a nurse practitioner declined to review documents that were provided the day she died, May 17, and no personnel were aware of her chronic conditions, the Customs and Border Protection's Office of Professional Responsibility said in an initial statement Thursday after its investigation into the child's death. The nurse practitioner also reported refusing three or four requests from the girl's mother for an ambulance or for her child to be taken to a hospital that day, the statement said. Anadith's mother, Mabel Álvarez, had previously said repeated requests for an ambulance were denied. The internal review has so far focused on the ""events and interactions” that unfolded between the time Anadith and her family arrived at the Harlingen U.S. Border Patrol Station on May 14 for medical isolation to the day she was transported to the hospital and later died. Between the time of her family’s arrival the night of May 14, CBP-contracted medical personnel reported having around nine encounters with Anadith and her mother, with the child complaining of fever, flu-like symptoms and pain, the statement said. Medical personnel administered Oseltamivir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu, to the girl as prescribed, it said. They also treated her fever, which at one point peaked at 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit early in the morning of May 16, the day before she died, with a combination of ice packs, fever-reducing medications and a cold shower, it added. “Despite the girl’s condition, her mother’s concerns, and the series of treatments required to manage her condition, contracted medical personnel did not transfer her to a hospital for higher-level care,” the statement said. A fever is typically defined as a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher and the American Academy of Pediatrics says a pediatrician should be called right away if a fever rises above 104 degrees repeatedly at any age. The internal investigation found that contracted medical personnel did not consult with on-call physicians, including an on-call pediatrician, about the girl’s condition, symptoms or treatment and they failed to document “numerous medical encounters, emergency antipyretic interventions, and administrations of medicine."" Anadith was only taken to a hospital the next day, May 17, after her mother returned to medical personnel after repeated visits just before 2 p.m. local time with her daughter in her arms as the child appeared to suffer a seizure. The child became unresponsive, prompting medical personnel to call for emergency medical services and provide CPR aided by an automated external defibrillator, which did not recommend any defibrillation, the statement said. Anadith was taken to a hospital after 2 p.m. and was declared dead less than an hour later at 2:50 p.m. The child had already been seen on four occasions earlier that day by a nurse practitioner after complaining of a stomach ache, nausea and difficulty breathing, according to the statement. The nurse practitioner denied three or four requests during that time from the girl's mother for an ambulance to be called or for her child to be taken to a hospital. At around 10:30 a.m. local time that morning, another contracted medical worker reported having brought a pile of documents from the family's property to the nurse practitioner, but the nurse declined to review the papers, the statement said. It did not expand on what the exact contents of the documents were. As of Thursday, the professional responsibility office's review found that ""none of the CBP contracted medical personnel or U.S. Border Patrol personnel at Harlingen Station who interacted with the girl, or her mother, acknowledged being aware she suffered from sickle cell anemia or had a history of congenital heart disease,"" despite that information being provided. The statement noted that a closed-circuit television recording system at Harlingen Station was not functioning during the time Anadith and her family were in custody and it said only three medical encounters were formally documented. As a result, it said Thursday's update was based largely on interviews with Border Patrol agents and contracted medical personnel who interacted with the family. Anadith's family has called for justice following the 8-year-old's death. “Anadith’s parents came to this country seeking what most of us want for our children — safety, opportunity, and the chance at a better future, but instead, they were met with tragedy,” Karla Marisol Vargas, a senior attorney with the Beyond Borders Program at the Texas Civil Rights Project, said in a statement Friday afternoon. The organization is representing the girl’s family. “To add to their suffering and righteous anger, through this statement, the U.S. government is trying to divert responsibility for this little girl’s death away from their own deadly neglect,” Vargas said in the statement. The organization said it is seeking an independent autopsy for Anadith to determine her cause of death. The statement also said that Anadith’s mother “told every official she came into contact with” about her daughter’s medical history, including sharing medical documents with CBP and medical staff. “They could have done something for my daughter if they had called the ambulance sooner,” Álvarez told Noticias Telemundo from a shelter for migrants in McAllen, Texas, last month. “My daughter would still be alive.” Álvarez described her daughter as a “friendly, loving” girl who always thought of others, and who had hoped to one day help children with her same health conditions. In a statement Thursday, CBP Acting Commissioner Troy Miller said Anadith's death was a ""deeply upsetting and unacceptable tragedy."" In the days since the incident, he said CBP had taken multiple steps to address issues identified by the ongoing investigation, including directing a review of all medically fragile individuals and families in custody to prioritize their processing and minimize the amount of time they spend in custody. ""Through these efforts, we have reduced the average time in custody for family units by more than 50% from two weeks ago to today,"" he said. “We can —and we will— do better to ensure this never happens again,” he said.

Arkansas librarians sue to block new law that could jail them over explicit books,Tyler Kingkade,"June 2, 2023, 5:37 PM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 6:42 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A group of public libraries and book publishers in Arkansas is pushing back against a growing movement to restrict what children are allowed to read. Arkansas is one of four states that recently passed laws that make it easier to prosecute librarians over sexually explicit books, a designation conservatives often use to target books with descriptions of gender identity and sexuality. On Friday, a coalition led by the Central Arkansas Library System, based in Little Rock, filed a federal lawsuit it hopes will set a precedent about the constitutionality of such laws. The Central Arkansas Library System argued in a filing in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas that Act 372 violates the First Amendment by making it a misdemeanor for libraries to give children access to materials that are “harmful to minors.” The term — which means any depiction of nudity or sexual conduct meant to appeal to a prurient interest that lacks serious artistic, medical or political value and which contemporary community standards would find inappropriate for minors — is too broad, the suit contends. For example, the law would prohibit 17-year-olds from viewing materials deemed too explicit for 7-year-olds. The complaint also alleges that the law violates residents’ due process rights by allowing local elected officials to overrule librarians’ decisions about book challenges without providing explanations or permitting appeals from those who disagree. “There’s enormous angst and anxiety on the part of librarians in the state,” said Nate Coulter, the executive director of the Central Arkansas Library System, which has 17 branches in seven cities. “Because not only do they feel like people in the state government don’t respect their integrity, but they’re seen as a hostile party. They’ve been called groomers. They’ve been accused of being pedophiles. They’re basically targeted by a very divisive, angry group of people who are vocal about believing that somehow the library is the problem in our community.” It’s unclear how prosecutors or judges would handle such criminal cases, but violations of Act 372’s “harmful to minors” provision could result in maximum jail sentences of one year. The law also eliminates protections for librarians and teachers who distribute material “that is claimed to be obscene” as part of their job, a felony punishable by up to six years in prison; the lawsuit isn’t challenging that part of the law. Dan Sullivan, the Republican state senator who sponsored the measure, defended the possibility that a librarian could go to prison over children’s books. “We don’t exempt doctors from abuse laws. We don’t exempt pharmacists from drug laws,” Sullivan said. “And I don’t know why we would exempt librarians from these laws about what’s harmful to children.” Although the law doesn’t go into effect until Aug. 1, the lawsuit says Act 372 is already having an effect in Crawford County, where public libraries recently moved books about disabled people, puberty, religion and LGBTQ characters out of the children’s sections. When residents asked for the books to be moved back, Crawford County’s attorney defended the move and cited Act 372, according to a letter obtained by NBC News. The suit asks that a federal judge block prosecutors from enforcing Act 372’s provisions regarding book challenges and materials “harmful to minors.” It names the Crawford County government, Crawford County Judge, or CEO, Chris Keith and 28 prosecutors across the state in their official capacities as defendants. Keith declined to comment. The prosecutors either did not immediately respond to requests for comment or could not immediately be reached. Arkansas libraries are entering a nationwide maelstrom over children’s access to materials that include descriptions of sexuality and LGBTQ characters or themes. In the past two years, conflicts over restrictions on books have expanded from school and classroom libraries to public community libraries. As with school boards, library trustees meetings in many cities have turned from sleepy affairs to impassioned political battlegrounds, leading to heated rhetoric and legislation targeting librarians. This year, 15 states considered bills that would open public librarians up to criminal charges for letting minors check out certain books, according to the EveryLibrary Institute, a librarian advocacy group. The governors of Arkansas, Indiana and Montana signed bills into law, while in Idaho and North Dakota, similar measures passed but were vetoed by Republican governors. Last year, Oklahoma was the first state to pass a law removing librarians’ protection from prosecution. As the battles unfold locally, librarians have become targets of those who believe children shouldn’t have access to books with frank descriptions of sexuality, discussion of gender transitions or celebration of LGBTQ identity. In Moon Township, Pennsylvania, local elected officials — who’d objected to children’s books about drag queens — questioned a public library about its Disability Pride Month display, because they thought the use of the word “pride” was a reference to LGBTQ people. In Post Falls, Idaho, a library board called police to a meeting in February to address a rowdy crowd that kept shouting “shame” and “Satan” at people who defended keeping LGBTQ-themed books available for children. In Llano, Texas, county officials nearly shut down its library system this year over a dispute about whether to keep books like “Larry the Farting Leprechaun” and “I Need a New Butt!” on the shelf because residents complained the illustrations appealed to pedophiles. Clare Graham, the director of the Malvern-Hot Spring County Library in central Arkansas, has been watching in disbelief as such arguments roil communities in the state and beyond. “The messaging is saying, ‘If you are against this, you want kids to see porn,’ and that’s wrong, but that’s the way it’s been framed,” Graham said. “It leaves me scratching my head, because we are a sanctuary for many, and we are a neutral space.” In Saline County, in central Arkansas, dueling billboards show the divisions over public libraries. Billboards sponsored by the Saline County Republican Women and the Saline County Republican Committee warn of “X-RATED LIBRARY BOOKS” and direct people to a website that primarily highlights books that include LGBTQ characters. One example is a children’s book published by HBO’s “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” about a gay bunny named after former Vice President Mike Pence’s pet rabbit, which the website says is inappropriate for children and part of the library’s effort to “draw them away from Christian values.” In response, the Saline County Library Alliance, a group of residents opposed to book restrictions, put up a billboard urging residents to “FIGHT THE LIES. STAND WITH THE LIBRARY.” Bailey Morgan, who raised money for the billboards, said they fear the campaign against supposed explicit books will lead to funding cuts for the library, as has happened elsewhere in the state.

"Cynthia Weil, 'You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling' songwriter and Grammy-winner, dies at 82",The Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 6:07 PM UTC",Obituaries,"Cynthia Weil, a Grammy-winning lyricist of notable range and endurance who enjoyed a decades-long partnership with husband Barry Mann and helped write “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling,” “On Broadway,” “Walking in the Rain” and dozens of other hits, has died at age 82. Weil’s daughter, Dr. Jenn Mann, said that the songwriter died Thursday at her home in Beverly Hills, California, “surrounded by her family.” Mann, the couple’s only child, declined to cite a specific cause of death. Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, married in 1961, were one of popular music’s most successful teams, part of a remarkable ensemble recruited by impresarios Don Kirshner and Al Nevins and based in Manhattan’s Brill Building neighborhood, a few blocks from Times Square. With such hit-making combinations as Carole King and Gerry Goffin and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, the Brill Building song factory turned out many of the biggest singles of the ’60s and beyond. “I grew up around a lot of music and two incredible, brilliant, creative geniuses,” Jenn Mann said. “My parents inspired each other to write great songs. My mom always said that when things were good they had each other, and when things weren’t as good they had their music.” Weil and Mann were key collaborators with producer Phil Spector on songs for the Ronettes (“Walking in the Rain”), the Crystals (“He’s Sure the Boy I Love”) and other performers, and also provided hits for everyone from Dolly Parton to Hanson. “Somewhere Out There,” a collaboration with James Horner for the soundtrack of “An American Tail,” won Grammys in 1987 for best song and best song for a movie or television, and was nominated for an Academy Award and Golden Globe. “Don’t Know Much,” a Linda Ronstadt-Aaron Neville duet they helped write, was a top 5 hit that won a best pop performance Grammy in 1990. Their most famous song, a work of history overall, was “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling,” an anthem of “blue-eyed soul” produced by Spector as if scoring a tragedy and sung with desperate fury by the Righteous Brothers. “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling” topped the charts in 1965 and was covered by numerous other artists. According to Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), no other song was played more on radio and television in the 20th century. But when Weil and Mann first played “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling” for the Righteous Brothers, the response from singers Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield was “dead silence.” “Bill said, ‘Sounds good for The Everly Brothers not the Righteous Brothers,‘” she told Parade magazine in 2015. “We thought ‘Oh, God.’ Then Bobby said, ‘What am I supposed to do while the big guy’s singing?’ and Phil (Spector) said “You can go to the bank.’” While many of Weil’s peers struggled once the Beatles caught on in the mid-1960s, she continued to make hits, sometimes with Mann, or with such partners as Michael Masser, David Foster and John Williams, with whom she wrote “For Always” for the soundtrack to Steven Spielberg’s “A.I. Artificial Intelligence.” Weil helped write Parton’s pop breakthrough “Here You Come Again”; the Peabo Bryson ballad “If Ever You’re In My Arms Again”; James Ingram’s “Just Once”; the Pointer Sisters’ “He’s So Shy”; and Lionel Richie’s “Running With the Night.” In 1997, she was in the top 10 again with Hanson’s “I Will Come to You.” “When they are successful, songs are like little novels. They have a beginning, a middle and an end. You feel what the person is feeling who’s singing it and it paints a picture of the human condition,” Weil, who eventually published the novel “I’m Glad I Did,” told Parade. Her talents reached well beyond love ballads. She and Mann wrote one of rock’s first anti-drug songs, “Kicks,” a hit for Paul Revere and the Raiders in 1966. She also had a knack for lyrics about ambition and aspiration, such as “On Broadway” and its unforgettable opening line, “They say the neon lights are bright/on Broadway.” The Animals had a hit with her tale of working class frustration, “We’ve Got to Get Out of This Place.” The Crystals’ “Uptown” was a 1961 hit that touched upon race and class in ways not often heard in rock’s early years. Weil and Mann were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, with King introducing them at the Rock Hall ceremony. Mann and Weil were supporting characters in the hit Broadway musical about King, “Beautiful,” which opened in 2013 and documented the intense friendship and rivalry between the two married couples. Mann and Weil’s musical “They Wrote That?” had a brief run in 2004. “Cynthia’s high professional standard made us all better songwriters. My favorite Cynthia lyric is, “Just a little lovin’ early in the mornin’ beats a cup of coffee for startin’ out the day,‘” King wrote on her social media accounts Friday, quoting from the Mann-Weil ballad “Just a Little Lovin,’” covered by Dusty Springfield among others. “If we’re lucky, we know this is true, but she wrote it — and then she rhymed ‘mornin” with ‘yawnin’’ in the next verse. May the legacy of lyrics by Cynthia Weil continue to speak to and for generations to come.” Weil, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, was born in New York City and studied piano and ballet as a child. She majored in theater at Sarah Lawrence College, but was encouraged by an agent to try songwriting. By age 20, she was working for the publishing company of “Guys and Dolls” composer Frank Loesser, and would soon meet her future husband. “I was writing with a young Italian boy singer, the Frankie Avalon of his day, named Teddy Randazzo, when Barry came in to play him a song,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2016. “I asked the receptionist, ‘Who is this guy? Does he have a girlfriend?’ She said, ‘He’s signed to a friend of mine, Don Kirshner, and if I call Donny, maybe you can go up there to show him your lyrics and meet Barry again.’ So that’s what she did. And that’s what I did. He didn’t have a chance.” "
Padma Lakshmi announces she’s leaving ‘Top Chef’ after 17 years,"Gina Vivinetto, TODAY","June 2, 2023, 6:01 PM UTC",Pop Culture News,"Padma Lakshmi is packing up her knives and leaving “Top Chef” after 17 years. The longtime host, 52, announced Friday in a statement on social media that she will exit the Bravo cooking competition after Season 20 in part to focus on her Hulu series, “Taste the Nation.” “After much soul searching, I have made the difficult decision to leave Top Chef,” wrote Lakshmi, who is also an executive producer for the show. “Having completed a glorious 20th season as host and executive producer, I am extremely proud to have been part of building such a successful show and of the impact it has had in the worlds of television and food. “After 17 years, many of the cast and crew are like family to me and I will miss working alongside them dearly. I feel it’s time to move on and need to make space for ‘Taste the Nation,’ my books and other creative pursuits,” she continued. Lakshmi concluded by telling fans she was “deeply thankful” for so “many years of love and support.” The former model joined “Top Chef” in its second season in 2006, replacing original host Katie Lee. The TV personality and author has been nominated for 13 Emmy Awards for “Top Chef,” including three for Outstanding Host For A Reality Or Competition Program. Though Lakshmi’s departure comes as a surprise, she sounded uncertain about her future on “Top Chef” in an oral history of the show published last month in The Hollywood Reporter. “I hope the show does well. Television is always an unpredictable realm. No show lasts forever. I think we have had a really, really great run. I hope the show continues for a really long time,” she told the publication. During a visit to “Jimmy Kimmel Live” last month, Lakshmi stunned fans when she opened up about just how many calories she eats behind the scenes on “Top Chef.” “First half of the season when we have a lot of contestants, eight or nine thousand calories a day … easily,” Lakshmi said, before jokingly challenging Kimmel’s sidekick Guillermo Rodriguez to an eating contest. “Hot dogs with no ketchup,” she quipped. Lakshmi also made headlines last month for posing in a bikini in the 2023 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. “It was so exciting to do it,” Lakshmi said during a May 15 visit to ""TODAY."" “I mean, I would have killed for it in my 20s when I was a model, but that it’s happening now is all the much sweeter, and I’m glad they’re being more diverse.” In a video Sports Illustrated filmed to promote the issue, Lakshmi said, at 52, she was excited to represent older women. “I love where I am in my life and know my body is not perfect by any means, but I feel beautiful. I feel like I have a very lucky, fruitful, productive life,” she said. “My thighs may have been leaner, and my boobs were probably slightly higher in earlier parts of my life, but I have never felt better about myself. I hope they see a full woman in all my facets and nuances and some contradictions. I wouldn’t go back to my 20s if you paid me all the money in the world.” "
"Brothers, ages 8 and 9, fatally shot as they played with kittens in their backyard",The Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 5:26 PM UTC",Guns in America,"Relatives of two young boys killed by gunfire as they played with kittens in the backyard of their Pennsylvania home were mourning them as authorities announced two men were charged with their slayings. Brothers Jesus and Sebastian Perez-Salome, ages 8 and 9, and a third victim were killed Tuesday night in Lebanon. An adult and a teen were charged in the shooting, and police said they were seeking a third suspect. In a phone interview Thursday from his home in Puerto Rico, the children’s uncle Felix Muniz Torres said their mother was working at a nearby convenience store when she heard the shots ring out. She ran over to find them shot, he said. Her other child, who is 13, was fortunately at a school event. “She’s in shock and is unable to speak coherently,” Muniz Torres said. He described his nephews as “very innocent and polite,” always together playing, mostly with their superhero figures. “They were very close,” he said. Alex Torres Santos, 22, and a boy, 16, were both charged with three counts of criminal homicide, Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf said at a news conference in Lebanon on Thursday. They also face aggravated assault, conspiracy and weapons offenses related to the shooting in Lebanon, a small city in an agricultural region roughly 70 miles northwest of Philadelphia. A third male is still being sought and will likely face similar charges, authorities said. Santos was on house arrest for several unrelated charges and was wearing an ankle monitor at the time of the shooting. A 33-year-old neighbor who was wounded by a stray bullet underwent surgery and remains hospitalized but is expected to recover, authorities said. The shooters apparently targeted the third person who was killed, 19-year-old Joshua Lugo-Perez, over what authorities called “a previous argument.” He and the boys lived at the home where the shooting occurred, but Lugo-Perez was not related to them. Jesus Perez-Salome was pronounced dead at the scene. Sebastian Perez-Salome and Lugo-Perez both died a short time later at hospitals. Once the autopsies are completed, the family will bring the boys back to Puerto Rico to be buried, Muniz Torres said. He expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support and donations responding to a GoFundMe appeal to raise funds for their funeral. The family had come to the United States in 2019 to chase the American dream of finding better opportunities than what was offered on their Caribbean island. But life had not been easy. Only a year ago, they had lost everything they owned in a fire at their previous apartment that started because of an electrical problem, Muniz Torres said. A Lebanon County SWAT team arrested Santos at his apartment Wednesday. Authorities said he attempted to flee the residence but was captured there, while the teenage suspect was later arrested at a nearby apartment where he was trying to hide. Ammunition and multiple firearms were found at the apartment where Santos was arrested, authorities said. Graf, the district attorney, said Thursday that the suspects could potentially face the death penalty, but that decision has not yet been made. It wasn’t clear Thursday if either suspect had retained an attorney, and court records were not immediately available. "
"Florida man points gun at woman's head after vehicle briefly backs into his driveway, authorities say",Antonio Planas,"June 2, 2023, 5:19 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A Florida man was charged with aggravated assault after allegedly pointing a gun at a woman's head when her friend used the suspect’s driveway to back up a vehicle, authorities said. Terry Vetsch, 60, of Palm Coast, approached the two victims from his home on Saturday, yelling and “armed with a gun after one of the victims had briefly used Vetsch’s driveway to backup their vehicle,” according to a Facebook post from the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office. Vetsch “used the gun to strike the victim’s backseat window before the other victim approached him and an argument ensued. Vetsch then pointed his gun at the victim’s head and continued to argue with them,” the sheriff’s office said. According to a charging affidavit provided by the sheriff's office, he also allegedly threatened to shoot and kill one of the victims. Vetsch told a deputy who responded to his home that he thought the alleged victims were his neighbors, whom he had previously had several arguments with. The deputy received permission from Vetsch to review surveillance footage that captured the incident. The video showed a woman following Vetsch toward his property while arguing, but the victims “had not trespassed” when Vetsch pointed the gun, according to the sheriff’s office. Vetsch could not be immediately reached for comment Friday afternoon. The sheriff's office on Friday provided NBC News with a roughly 95-second video of the alleged incident, appearing to show Vetsch pointing a handgun at a woman after he confronted her because a vehicle was on the driveway. The woman and Vetsch repeatedly swear at each other and the woman can be heard saying, ""You pointed a gun at my head."" Vetsch was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill. He was jailed and held on $50,000 bond, the sheriff’s office said. Vetsch posted bond on Sunday, court records show. He was ordered no contact with the victim and to surrender his firearms and ammo, which he did following his jail release, according to the sheriff's office. Palm Coast is about 80 miles northeast of Orlando. Vetsch’s Florida arrest is similar to an April incident in New York in which a homeowner fatally shot 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis after her boyfriend pulled into the wrong driveway while looking for a party. Kevin Monahan is charged with second-degree murder in the incident. If convicted, he faces a minimum of 15 years to life and a maximum of 25 years to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty. "
Pride Night celebrations at the ballpark were largely uncontroversial — until now,David K. Li,"June 2, 2023, 4:53 PM UTC",OUT News,"For the better part of two decades, Pride Night celebrations in professional sports went off with a minimum of fanfare, as clubs eagerly showed off their embrace of the LGBTQ community. Fast-forward to last month, when a Florida lawmaker voiced displeasure with the Pride Night guest list of a Major League Baseball team 2,700 miles away, leading to a cancellation, un-cancellation and hurt feelings of everyone involved — including that of a two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher. Somewhere along the line, the routine act of backing a generic LGBTQ celebration became not-so-routine anymore, with even  stitching on practice jerseys becoming a hot-button topic. ""I think it's people's existing political leanings showing a little bit,"" said U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., chairman of the Congressional Equality Caucus and one of Congress' 13 openly LGBTQ members. He added, ""Since Donald Trump, a lot of people who wear white hoods have left them in the closet for the last six years. You can suddenly say stuff that's unpopular out loud, because this is the current environment."" Cyd Ziegler, a historian of gay sports and the founder of the LGBTQ sports news website Outsports, traces the current backlash to two inflection points: patches and pronouns. Five Tampa Bay Rays players refused to wear LGBTQ Pride-themed jerseys last June. And earlier this year, Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Ivan Provorov and San Jose Sharks goaltender James Reimer refused to wear warmup equipment with Pride symbols. ""We had teams that started to put Pride rainbow flags on the uniforms of players, and that is when some of the players were like, 'Uh, I'm not doing that,'"" Ziegler said. ""So that was a change."" But the bigger inflection point, he said, might be centered on issues around transgender rights. Embrace of cornerstone gay rights, such as same-sex marriage, was a relatively simple step for most Americans, Ziegler said, and far less complicated than questioning gender roles and identification. This is ""the new battlefront,"" he said, and with trans rights front and center, he doesn't think the Pride Night debates are going away anytime soon. “This is not just a bump in the road,” Ziegler said of the backlash. “This is going to be a fight."" The most recent debate over Pride Night stems from the Los Angeles Dodgers honoring the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence at the team’s annual LGBTQ Pride event on June 16. The decades-old charitable group of drag performers describe themselves as a “leading-edge Order of queer and trans nuns.” The Pride Night temperatures could even be boiling into the 2024 presidential race, with former Vice President Mike Pence chiming in  Wednesday about the Dodgers' guest list. ""Having been raised in a Catholic family, the Dodgers decision to invite the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a hateful group that blatantly mocks Catholicism, to their event next month is deeply offensive,"" Pence told his Twitter followers on May 31. ""The MLB should not be apologizing to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, they should be apologizing to Catholics across America."" Athlete Ally, which promotes sports as a vehicle to end prejudice against the LGBTQ community, said in a statement this week that Pride Night events are important to greater acceptance of all communities. ""Sport has traditionally been a space where LGBTQI+ players, coaches and fans are unwelcome,"" the group said in a statement. ""While much progress has been made through the years, often thanks to out athletes and coaches who have helped pave the way forward, there still are tremendous barriers to making sport truly a safe, welcome and inclusive place for all."" The group added, ""Teams have the power to incorporate their values into how they show up for the communities that love and support them, and Pride nights are an opportunity for teams to proactively show up for their LGBTQI+ fans."" MLB's open embrace of the gay community dates back nearly 30 years, to when the San Francisco Giants held their first “Until There’s a Cure Day” in 1994. The game and pregame ceremonies raised  money and awareness in the battle against AIDS. The event was widely embraced in the San Francisco Bay Area with only minimal disruption. But Pride Day/Night celebrations are usually traced to a Dodger Stadium incident in August 2000, when security guards kicked out two female fans who had kissed in the stands. The team apologized, gave tickets to local gay community groups and, perhaps inadvertently, touched off a sequence of events leading to Pride Day/Night celebrations held by 29 of 30 MLB clubs ever since. The Texas Rangers remain the lone star holdout franchise to never have held such a celebration, Outsports reported. "
Texas cheerleader shot 3 times after friend got into wrong car recalls harrowing attack and hurdles in recovery,Marlene Lenthang,"June 2, 2023, 2:05 PM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 4:39 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Payton Washington, the Texas cheerleader who was shot and critically injured after a friend accidentally got into the wrong car in April, says she didn’t even see the shooter and tried to keep her friends calm, even as she was bleeding. The 18-year-old was struck by three bullets — twice in her right buttock and once in the back that impacted her left abdomen— on April 18 in the parking lot of an H-E-B in Elgin, a carpool point for her and her three cheerleading friends after practice. Her friend, Heather Roth, accidentally entered a car she thought was hers before noticing a man in the passenger seat and quickly exiting. That man, identified by police as Pedro Tello Rodriguez Jr., 25, then approached the vehicle the girls were in and opened fire. “I was actually texting and eating Twizzlers,” Washington recalled in an interview aired Friday morning on ""Good Morning America"" when the shooting started. “I didn’t see him honestly.” “I heard in the background what was happening but I didn’t think it was going to be as big of a deal as it was. She just kept saying like 'I’m sorry, I’m sorry,' that was the last thing really said,” she said. After hearing the first shot she ""turned immediately."" “I didn’t know where it was coming from or anything but it being so loud that my ears were ringing, I knew to turn and do something,” she said. The girls sped away from the scene in their car, and Washington realized she was struggling to breathe. “We were trying to get away as fast as we could. All the other girls were screaming. I really was just telling myself don’t breathe. It was hard to breathe because of my diaphragm,” she explained. Despite her injury, her focus was keeping her friends calm. “I was trying to stay as calm as possible for the other people in the car. I could tell how sad and scared they were. The more calm you are, like your body will stay calm as well,"" she said. ""Of course it was scary but I wasn’t going to act like I was scared.” That's when she noticed blood on her passenger seat, but she couldn't tell where her wounds were due to her adrenaline rush. When they pulled over, she started to throw up. “I was throwing up blood and I was like oop that’s not normal. So that’s when I knew something, somewhere was wrong,” she said. She was airlifted to the ICU in critical condition and she soon learned her spleen was shattered, she had two holes each in her stomach and diaphragm. She said in her treatment doctors had to remove a lobe from her pancreas and she had 32 staples on her body. Roth was grazed by a bullet and the two other girls in the car were not physically injured. Washington, a decorated champion cheerleader, was determined to regain her strength but it was no easy feat. “It was hard. Hurting to walk or stand is really weird when a week before you were doing a bunch of flips, running the track and doing long jump,"" she said to ABC News. ""Can’t get out of bed by yourself, can’t roll off the couch, can’t stand by yourself, going up the stairs I’d get winded. Just stuff you never thought of before,” she continued. Her father, Kelan Washington previously told NBC News his daughter was strong and had an “undeniable will not to settle for anything.” “Payton’s accomplished everything she has with only one lung [from] when she was born. She’s as tough as they come,” he said. Five weeks later, Washington has made great strides in her recovery and was able to wear a cap and gown and join her friends at high school graduation. Now she's optimistic for her future, determined to return to her passions of cheer and tumbling this summer and set to attend Baylor University in the fall. Suspect Rodriguez Jr. was charged with deadly conduct, a third-degree felony, Elgin police said at the time. According to online jail records, he was released on May 12 on a $100,000 surety bond. His attorney, Charlie Baird, said in a statement Friday that Rodriguez was employed at the H.E.B. and was a victim of a robbery in a car in the past. He was startled when one of the young cheerleaders entered into his car and thought he was going to be robbed, Baird said. His bail was reduced to $100,000 from $500,000 after a hearing “where the judge heard evidence regarding the circumstances of this incident, and learned of Pedro’s ties to the community and his lack of a criminal record,” Baird said. “Pedro wishes Ms. Washington a full and speedy recovery.” Washington said she isn't focused on the shooter. “He did what he did and I’m just going to try and get through it. There’s no point in me really thinking about what he did,” Washington said. Instead, she wants her story to be a message of hope to others. “You can literally do anything, if you push and persevere,” she said. “Don’t doubt yourself ever. Cause you can do anything as long as you're putting your 120% into it.” "
Search suspended for 2 missing during tragic family fishing trip in Alaska,Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 4:12 PM UTC",U.S. news,"JUNEAU, Alaska  — An Alaska fishing adventure became a nightmare for a family of eight when disaster struck one of the two boats they chartered over the Memorial Day weekend, leaving three people dead and two more missing despite a desperate search over hundreds of square miles of ocean. The tragedy tore the Tyau family apart: Two sisters and one of their husbands are dead, while the other’s partner and the boat captain remain missing off southeast Alaska four days after the boat was found partially submerged off an island. Authorities suspended a more than 20-hour search covering 825 square miles (2,100 square kilometers) on Monday and have no plans to resume it. The women’s parents, older brother and sister-in-law were on the other charter boat as part of a three-day trip to a destination fishery known for king salmon and groundfish. The sisters and their sister-in-law didn’t like fishing but joined the vacation to spend more time with a family that was usually split between Hawaii and Los Angeles. “It was just supposed to be a simple family get-together for eight of us, since we haven’t been together in the same spot for so long,” Michael Tyau, the older brother, told The Associated Press on Thursday. “For it to turn out like this is really devastating.” The Tyau siblings — Michael, Brandi and Danielle — grew up fishing in Hawaii with their parents. Michael Tyau said his sisters hated being cold and wet but would endure it for their water-loving parents and later their partners. Brandi Tyau’s longtime partner, Robert Solis — a Navy diver-turned-private investigator who was stationed in Hawaii when they met decades ago — was someone for whom “ the ocean really was his life,” one of Solis’ brothers said. So when the Tyau siblings’ mother suggested a family trip last year, a fishing vacation in the Sitka Sound won out. “My sisters, I think, reluctantly agreed,” Michael Tyau said. He and his wife flew from Los Angeles to Alaska on Thursday with Brandi Tyau, 56, and Solis, 61. They met up with their parents, sister Danielle Agcaoili, 53, and her husband, 57-year-old Maury Agcaoili, all Hawaii residents. The whole family stayed in a lodge owned by charter boat company Kingfisher Charters in Sitka. The small port city with a backdrop of a stunning volcanic mountain is located on the shore of Baranof Island, which is part of a cluster of islands dripping off Alaska’s southeast coastline. The area is a “premier fishing destination” for tourists because the many bays and passageways created by the islands provide protection from the wind and waves on days when the open sea is too rough, Kingfisher Charters says on its website. Forrest Braden, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Guides Organization, said anglers often stay for multiple days on trips to the region. “It’s more of a fishing-themed trip for a lot of people, rather than being one of a variety of activities that they do,” he said. The boats the Tyau clan chartered, named the Pockets and the Awakin, set out Friday amid rough conditions. Michael Tyau said his sisters and wife spent the day’s voyage seasick in the two boats’ cabins and skipped Saturday’s trip to recover on land. When Sunday dawned, their last vacation day before Monday flights home, the women rejoined the boats. Danielle Agcaoili said “she didn’t want to let anybody down,” Michael Tyau recalled through tears. The boat captains opted for different fishing spots. Aboard the Pockets, Michael Tyau said he “in no way felt in jeopardy, like this wasn’t safe for us to fish in.” The Pockets returned to the lodge Sunday evening, but the family began worrying when Brandi Tyau, Danielle Agcaoili, Maury Agcaoili and Solis didn’t respond to text messages and never arrived for dinner. The Awakin hadn’t come back, the charter company told Michael Tyau, and they lost radio contact with the captain, 32-year-old Morgan Robidou. What happened aboard the Awakin on Sunday remains unclear. Efforts to recover the 30-foot (9-meter) aluminum vessel have been hampered by rough seas and strong winds. The bodies of Brandi Tyau and Danielle Agcaoili were found inside the cabin. Maury Agcaoili’s body was discovered near the boat. Solis and Robidou were still considered missing Thursday. The boat was last seen Sunday afternoon near Sitka, authorities said, but around 7 p.m. Sunday was found partially submerged off Low Island, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of Sitka. Coast Guard investigators are working to determine the timeline and cause of the incident. The area was experiencing 6-foot to 11-foot (1.8- to 3.35-meter) waves, a Coast Guard spokesperson said. Kingfisher Charters declined to respond to questions outside a statement released Wednesday saying the company is “devastated by the loss of the guests and captain of the Awakin” and is fully cooperating with an investigation it hopes “furnishes answers to the questions as to how it occurred.” For the Tyau family, it’s too late. The deaths of Brandi Tyau, the reserved middle child who was a calming influence on Solis, and Danielle Agcaoili, the happy-go-lucky baby of the family who was often called “Dani,” has been devastating. Brandi Tyau and Solis leave behind one son together, as well as Solis’ three sons from a previous relationship. The Agcaoilis have two children, one of whom just graduated from high school. The family’s vacation was meant for them to enjoy a holiday weekend away and bridge the gap between their homes in Hawaii and Los Angeles. “I don’t think all eight of us have been together in over 10 years,” Michael Tyau said. Now, only four are left. "

"Jeffrey Epstein tried to send a letter to Larry Nassar before his death, records show",The Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 2:37 PM UTC",U.S. news,"NEW YORK — Two weeks before ending his life, Jeffrey Epstein sat in the corner of his Manhattan jail cell with his hands over his ears, desperate to muffle the sound of a toilet that wouldn’t stop running. Epstein was agitated and unable to sleep, jail officials observed in records newly obtained by The Associated Press. He called himself a “coward” and complained he was struggling to adapt to life behind bars following his July 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges — his life of luxury reduced to a concrete and steel cage. The disgraced financier was under psychological observation at the time for a suicide attempt just days earlier that left his neck bruised and scraped. Yet, even after a 31-hour stint on suicide watch, Epstein insisted he wasn’t suicidal, telling a jail psychologist he had a “wonderful life” and “would be crazy” to end it. On Aug. 10, 2019, Epstein was dead. Nearly four years later, the AP has obtained more than 4,000 pages of documents related to Epstein’s death from the federal Bureau of Prisons under the Freedom of Information Act. They include a detailed psychological reconstruction of the events leading to Epstein’s suicide, as well as his health history, internal agency reports, emails, memos and other records. Taken together, the documents the AP obtained Thursday provide the most complete accounting to date of Epstein’s detention and death, and its chaotic aftermath. The records help to dispel the many conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein’s suicide, underscoring how fundamental failings at the Bureau of Prisons — including severe staffing shortages and employees cutting corners — contributed to Epstein’s death. They shed new light on the federal prison agency’s muddled response after Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at the now-shuttered Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. In one email, a prosecutor involved in Epstein’s criminal case complained about a lack of information from the Bureau of Prisons in the critical hours after his death, writing that it was “frankly unbelievable” that the agency was issuing public press releases “before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family.” In another email, a high-ranking Bureau of Prisons official made a spurious suggestion to the agency’s director that news reporters must have been paying jail employees for information about Epstein’s death because they were reporting details of the agency’s failings — impugning the ethics of journalists and the agency’s own workers. The documents also provide a fresh window into Epstein’s behavior during his 36 days in jail, including his previously unreported attempt to connect by mail with another high-profile pedophile: Larry Nassar, the U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of athletes. Epstein’s letter to Nassar was found returned to sender in the jail’s mail room weeks after Epstein’s death. “It appeared he mailed it out and it was returned back to him,” the investigator who found the letter told a prison official by email. “I am not sure if I should open it or should we hand it over to anyone?” The letter itself was not included among the documents turned over to the AP. The night before Epstein’s death, he excused himself from a meeting with his lawyers to make a telephone call to his family. According to a memo from a unit manager, Epstein told a jail employee that he was calling his mother, who’d been dead for 15 years at that point. Epstein’s death put increased scrutiny on the Bureau of Prisons and led the agency to close the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 2021. It spurred an AP investigation that has uncovered deep, previously unreported problems within the agency, the Justice Department’s largest with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates and an $8 billion annual budget. An internal memo, undated but sent after Epstein’s death, attributed problems at the jail to “seriously reduced staffing levels, improper or lack of training, and follow up and oversight.” The memo also detailed steps the Bureau of Prisons has taken to remedy lapses Epstein’s suicide exposed, including requiring supervisors to review surveillance video to ensure officers made required cell checks. Epstein’s lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said people detained at the facility endured “medieval conditions of confinement that no American defendant should have been subjected to.” “It’s sad, it’s tragic, that it took this kind of event to finally cause the Bureau of Prisons to close this regrettable institution,” Weinberg said Thursday in a phone interview. The workers tasked with guarding Epstein the night he killed himself, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged with lying on prison records to make it seem as though they had made their required checks before Epstein was found lifeless. Epstein’s cellmate did not return after a court hearing the day before, and prison officials failed to pair another prisoner with him, leaving him alone. Prosecutors alleged they were sitting at their desks just 15 feet from Epstein’s cell, shopped online for furniture and motorcycles, and walked around the unit’s common area instead of making required rounds every 30 minutes. During one two-hour period, both appeared to have been asleep, according to their indictment. Noel and Thomas admitted to falsifying the log entries but avoided prison time under a deal with federal prosecutors. Copies of some of those logs were included among the documents released Thursday, with the guards’ signatures redacted. Another investigation, by the Justice Department’s inspector general, is still ongoing. Epstein arrived at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on July 6, 2019. He spent 22 hours in the jail’s general population before officials moved him to the special housing unit “due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among the inmate population,” according to the psychological reconstruction of his death. Epstein later said he was upset about having to wear an orange jumpsuit provided to inmates in the special housing unit and complained about being treated like he was a “bad guy” despite being well-behaved behind bars. He requested a brown uniform for his near-daily visits with his lawyers. During an initial health screening, the 66-year-old said that he had 10-plus female sexual partners within the previous five years. Medical records showed he was suffering from sleep apnea, constipation, hypertension, lower back pain and prediabetes and had been previously treated for chlamydia. Epstein did make some attempts to adapt to his jailhouse surroundings, the records show. He signed up for a Kosher meal and told prison officials, through his lawyer, that he wanted permission to exercise outside. Two days before he was found dead, Epstein bought $73.85 worth of items from the prison commissary, including an AM/FM radio and headphones. He had $566 left in his account when he died. Epstein’s outlook worsened when a judge denied him bail on July 18, 2019 — raising the prospect that he’d remain locked up until trial and, possibly longer. If convicted, he faced up to 45 years prison. Four days later, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. Epstein survived. His injuries didn’t require going to the hospital. He was placed on suicide watch and, later, psychiatric observation. Jail officers noted in logs that they observed him, “sitting at the edge of the bed, lost in thought,” and sitting “with his head against the wall.” Epstein expressed frustration with the noise of the jail and his lack of sleep. His first few weeks at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Epstein didn’t have his sleep apnea breathing apparatus he used. Then, the toilet in his cell started acting up. “He was still left in the same cell with a broken toilet,” the jail’s chief psychologist wrote in a email the next day. “Please move him to the cell next door when he returns from legal as the toilet still does not work.” The day before Epstein ended his life, a federal judge unsealed about 2,000 pages of documents in a sexual abuse lawsuit against him. That development, prison officials observed, further eroded Epstein’s previous elevated status. That, combined with a lack of significant interpersonal connections and “the idea of potentially spending his life in prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide,” officials wrote.

"Girl, 4, found dead in Florida canal after wandering away from her family's vacation rental",David K. Li,"June 2, 2023, 2:12 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Searchers found the body of a 4-year-old girl who wandered away from her family's vacation rental in Florida, officials said Friday. A Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission boat came upon the remains of Evelyn K. Geer on the edge of a canal in Port Charlotte, according to the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office. That location was behind a home the family had rented from VRBO, the sheriff said. “We are heartbroken to confirm that the body of 4-year-old Evelyn K. Geer has been discovered,” according to the sheriff’s statement. “FWC located her about an hour ago while searching by boat. Please keep the family in your prayers as they go through this unbearable time,” the sheriff's office added. The sheriff sent the department's bloodhound to search for the diaper-clad girl around a neighborhood bordered by Barksdale Street, Cochran Boulevard and Collingswood Boulevard, about 30 miles north of Fort Myers, officials said. Cochran had been closed during the search but that street has since been reopened to traffic. "
Michigan man who killed radio news anchor and attacked his family sentenced to life in prison,The Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 11:02 AM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 1:32 PM UTC",U.S. news,"MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. — A Detroit-area man has been sentenced to life in prison for the brutal slaying of a radio news anchor and attack on the anchor’s family. Macomb County Circuit Court Judge James Biernat called Arthur Williamson the “embodiment of evil” Thursday during sentencing in Mount Clemens, according to The Detroit News. “The only thing that’s amazing is you didn’t kill all of them,” Biernat said. Williamson of Pontiac pleaded no contest in April to first-degree murder, assault with intent to murder and unlawful imprisonment. A no-contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is used as such at sentencing. In September, WWJ-AM overnight anchor Jim Matthews was found bludgeoned with a hammer in Chesterfield Township, northeast of Detroit. Authorities have said Williamson, 55, was a friend of Matthews’ girlfriend, Nichole Guertin. Guertin and the 10-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter she shared with Matthews were injured. The boy was also struck in the head with the hammer and left tied up in a closet. Guertin testified that Matthews was working a late shift when Williamson came to their home to smoke crack cocaine and bring heroin. Guertin said that when she refused to role play and tie herself up, Williamson slashed her throat and zip-tied her wrists and ankles, The Detroit News reported. When Matthews arrived home, he was struck with a hammer and stabbed. Guertin escaped with their 5-year-old daughter and asked someone to call the police. Matthews’ and Guertin’s son wrote in a victim impact statement to the court that Williamson ruined their lives. “I hate you for what you did to me and my family,” the boy wrote. “You put me and my mom and my sister through hours of hell. You are evil.” "
"The U.S. economy added 339,000 jobs in May, once again beating expectations","Jeff Cox, CNBC","June 2, 2023, 12:38 PM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 1:03 PM UTC",Economy,"The U.S. economy continued to crank out jobs in May, with nonfarm payrolls surging more than expected despite multiple headwinds, the Labor Department reported Friday. Payrolls in the public and private sector increased by 339,000 for the month, better than the 190,000 Dow Jones estimate and marking the 29th straight month of positive job growth. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in May against the estimate for 3.5%, even though the labor force participation rate was unchanged. The jobless rate was the highest since October 2022, though still near the lowest since 1969. Average hourly earnings, a key inflation indicator, rose 0.3% for the month, which was in line with expectations. On an annual basis, wages increased 4.3%, which was 0.1 percentage point below the estimate. The average workweek fell by 0.1 hour to 34.3 hours. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up about 200 points. Treasury yields rose as well. May’s hiring jump was almost exactly in line with the 12-month average of 341,000 in a job market that has held up remarkably well in an economy that has been slowing. Professional and business services led job creation for the month with a net 64,000 new hires. The government helped boost the numbers with an addition of 56,000 jobs, while health care contributed 52,000. Other notable gainers included leisure and hospitality (48,000), construction (25,000) and transportation and warehousing (24,000). May’s job numbers come amid a challenging time for the economy, with many experts still expecting a recession later this year or early in 2024. Recent data has shown that consumers continue to spend, though they are dipping into savings and increasingly using credit cards to pay for their purchases. A resilient labor market also has helped underpin spending, with job openings rising back above 10 million in April as employers still find it difficult to fill open positions. One major potential headache appears to have been eliminated, as warring factions in Washington this week have reached a debt ceiling deal. An agreement is on its way to President Joe Biden’s desk for a signature following passage in the House and Senate this week. There remain other issues ahead, though. The Federal Reserve has raised benchmark interest rates 10 times since March 2022 in an effort to fight inflation that hasn’t gone away. In recent days, some policymakers have indicated a willingness to take a break in June from the succession of hikes as they look to see what impact the policy tightening is having on the economy. Other data points have shown that the manufacturing sector of the economy is in contraction, though the much larger services sector has held in expansion. The ISM manufacturing index released Thursday also showed that prices are pulling back, a positive sign for the Fed. "
How the U.S.-China clash is being felt on campus,Janis Mackey Frayer,"June 2, 2023, 10:21 AM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 12:30 PM UTC",World,"SHANGHAI — When Megan See was looking for somewhere to study international relations, China seemed like a good place to start. “It was just totally different than anything I’d done before,” See, who arrived at New York University’s Shanghai campus in August 2019, told NBC News. There were also “obvious benefits to being exposed to a place that clearly has a lot of importance in U.S. foreign policy,” she added. But as with the broader relationship between the world’s two largest economies, Covid-19 would soon complicate ties between this American and China — exacerbating a trend that many fear is representative of a deeper lack of mutual understanding helping to fuel their growing rivalry. See’s studies were disrupted by the pandemic, which prompted China to close its borders for almost three years and impose other strict controls that included a grueling two-month lockdown last year for Shanghai’s 26 million people. But when China finally reopened at the start of this year, she was ready to return. “There was a lot of unknowns, but I thought it was worth the risk to come back and to be here again,” said See, 22, who is from suburban Washington, D.C.

Arizona limits new housing around Phoenix because of dwindling water supply,The Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 11:26 AM UTC",Climate in Crisis,"PHOENIX — Arizona will not approve new housing construction on the fast-growing edges of metro Phoenix that rely on groundwater thanks to years of overuse and a multi-decade drought that is sapping its water supply. In a news conference Thursday, Gov. Katie Hobbs announced the restrictions that could affect some of the fastest-growing suburbs of the nation’s fifth-largest city. Officials said developers could still build in the affected areas but would need to find alternative water sources to do so — such as surface or recycled water. Driving the state’s decision was a projection that showed that over the next 100 years, demand in metro Phoenix for almost 4.9 million acre-feet of groundwater would be unmet without further action, Hobbs said. An acre-foot of water is roughly enough for two to three U.S. households per year. Despite the move, the governor said the state isn’t running out of water. “Nobody who has water is going to lose their water,” Hobbs said. Officials said the move would not affect existing homeowners who already have assured water supplies. Hobbs added that there are 80,000 unbuilt homes that will be able to move forward because they already have assured water supply certificates within the Phoenix Active Management Area, a designation used for regulating groundwater. Years of drought in the West worsened by climate change have ratcheted up pressure among Western states to use less water. Much of the focus has stayed on the dwindling Colorado River, a main water source for Arizona and six other Western states. Over the past two years, Arizona’s supply from the 1,450-mile powerhouse of the West has been cut twice. Phoenix relies on imported Colorado River water and also uses water from the in-state Salt and Verde rivers. A small amount of the city’s water supply comes from groundwater and recycled wastewater. The drought has made groundwater — held in underground aquifers that can take many years to be replenished — even more vital. Under a 1980 state law aimed at protecting the state’s aquifers, Phoenix, Tucson and other Arizona cities have restrictions on how much groundwater they can pump. But in rural areas, there are few limitations on its use. Long pumped by farmers and rural residents in Arizona with little oversight, Hobbs and other state officials recently vowed to take more steps to protect the state’s groundwater supplies. In rapidly growing Phoenix suburbs such as Queen Creek and Buckeye, developers have relied on unallocated groundwater to show that they had adequate water supplies for the next 100 years, which Arizona requires for building permits in some areas. “Developers rely on groundwater because it has been frankly, cheaper and easier for them, and they have been able to move through the process much more quickly,” said Nicole Klobas, chief counsel for the Arizona Department of Water Resources. Under the new restrictions, that won’t be possible. “It closes off that path,” said Kathryn Sorenson, director of research at the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. Because the rule largely affects cities and towns outside Phoenix and larger cities in the metro area, Sorenson said developers would likely “weigh whether they want to continue to buy relatively cheap land ... and incur the cost of developing a whole new water supply versus purchase land that is probably more expensive without the boundaries of a designated city.” "
"Women more likely than men to skip or delay medications due to cost, CDC report finds",Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"June 2, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Health news,"Women are more likely than men to skip, delay or take less medication than was prescribed because of cost, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday. The finding came from the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey, an annual survey in which tens of thousands of people in the U.S. are asked questions about their health-related experiences. It found that in 2021, 9.2 million adults ages 18 to 64 — about 1 in 10 — reported skipping, delaying or using less medication than prescribed over the past year to save money. Women led men when it came to this nonadherence: 9.1% versus 7%. “I was not surprised by the findings, but they are disheartening,” said Robin Feldman, a pharmaceutical and intellectual property law expert at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco (formerly the University of California, Hastings). “Women today still shoulder more of the burden of child care and household management. They may make their own health a lower priority, in the face of financial or time pressures,” said Feldman, who was not involved in the survey. Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said the gender gap could also be due to the fact that women under 65 typically take more medications or are more likely to be on medication than men. However, Dusetzina noted another potential factor: “We know that women tend to have lower incomes than men.” Not taking medications as prescribed can “make health conditions worse, result in more serious illness and lead to additional expensive treatment,” said Eric Tichy, a pharmacist and division chair of pharmacy supply solutions at the Mayo Clinic. “It really is a vicious cycle.” More than half of adults ages 18 to 64 in the U.S. take at least one prescription drug, according to the CDC. The CDC survey also found adults with disabilities were more likely than adults without disabilities to skip, delay or take less medication to reduce cost. People in fair or poor health were almost threefold more likely to do so than those in excellent or very good health. In addition, adults without insurance were more likely than those with insurance to not take their medications because of cost, as were Black and nonwhite Hispanic adults, compared with white and Asian adults. Robin Cohen, a CDC statistician and co-author of the study, noted that the report does not look at what prescriptions people are taking or for what conditions. It also only looked at people who did not adhere to the medications because of the cost. “So there may be other reasons that people do not take medication as prescribed, but we do not evaluate them,” she said. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law last year, aims to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for people in the U.S., but most of the savings will likely go toward adults over the age of 65, said Inma Hernandez, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego’s Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Hernandez said it’s possible that a provision in the law that penalizes drugmakers that raise the prices of the medications faster than inflation could help adults under 65. That provision takes effect in 2024. “It is possible there are some spillover effects,” she said. In the meantime, more may need to be done, Feldman said. Last year, billionaire investor Mark Cuban launched the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co., which offers some generic drugs at discounted prices. California has also announced plans to make its own low-cost insulin. It will partner with Civica Rx, a nonprofit generic drug company. “There is much work to be done to bring sanity to drug pricing,” Feldman said. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
"Days before Iowa building collapsed, engineers warned it could crumble",Marlene Lenthang,"June 1, 2023, 5:48 PM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 4:19 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Four days before part of an Iowa apartment building collapsed, an engineering firm warned that it appeared at risk of crumbling. Select Structural Engineering said in a letter dated May 24 that large patches of brick “appear ready to fall imminently” and laid out repair recommendations “to keep the entire face of the building from falling away when the bottoms area(s) come loose.” The engineers also warned that “the brick façade is unlikely to be preserved in place, but it can be brought down in a safe, controlled manner.” City officials said Thursday that they didn’t order residents to vacate because they relied on the engineering team's assurances that the building was safe. The 116-year-old building in Davenport partly collapsed over the weekend, and three people are still unaccounted for, police said Thursday. They were identified as Branden Colvin, Ryan Hitchcock and Daniel Prien, 60. Police said this week that five people were unaccounted for, but two of them have been located: One moved out a month ago and was in Texas, and the other was in Davenport. Davenport Police Chief Jeffery Bladel said that there is a ""high probability"" the three missing people were home when part of the building caved in and that they are in ""that collapsed space."" ""All the information provided to us is that space is not sustainable to life,"" he said. Mayor Mike Matson said there's no timeline for demolition as officials work with experts to find a way to safely demolish the building while acknowledging it as a ""resting place."" Ryan Shaffer, who co-owns RA Masonry, said he repeatedly warned construction workers at that building, as well as the building’s owner, about the dangers there. RA Masonry put in a bid to do work at the building, and it was rejected, Shaffer said, but he kept up with the project. He said he warned workers there Saturday, a day before it fully collapsed, after he saw that interior layers of bricks — not just outer bricks — had been falling. “That’s the main structure of the building. If that falls, it’s going,” Shaffer said. “So Saturday is when I addressed the workers — I said, ‘You need to leave. It’s going to fall.’” The city released a cache of documents and permits Wednesday evening showing a history of tenant complaints and issues plaguing 324 Main St. Asked by reporters at a news conference Thursday why the building wasn't shut down despite myriad problems, city officials said that the collapse is ""a new thing for our city"" and that they trusted a report in May from an engineering firm hired by the property owner, which deemed the structure safe. Here are most damning revelations in the released documents: A citation was filed against Wold on Tuesday in Scott County Court for failing to maintain the building in a safe and sanitary condition. The city asked for a $300 fine plus court fees. “The city of Davenport requests that the Court order the defendant from committing any further violations of the city code provisions,” the citation said. City Attorney Tom Warner said the citation was filed to prevent Wold from transferring the property to avoid the demolition order. A court date is set for June 9. There have been outrage and frustration with the city’s handling of the building and the aftermath of the collapse. Former and recent tenants of the historic apartment building said they had complained to management for years about cracks in the walls, plumbing woes and a lack of heat and air conditioning — but were consistently ignored. Asked Thursday whether the city should have vacated the building to prevent such a disaster, Matson, the mayor, simply said: “I have the same anger and concern.” Wold, who bought the property in June 2021, issued his first public comment since the collapse Tuesday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with our tenants and families during this difficult time,” said a statement signed by Wold and the Village Property Management team. “We have been working closely with the American Red Cross and other agencies to assist the displaced tenants affected by this event. We are forever grateful to them for all of their assistance with our tenants,” the brief statement said. "
Attorney accused of rapes in Boston in 2007 and 2008 faces charges,Phil Helsel,"June 2, 2023, 3:19 AM UTC",U.S. news,"An attorney accused in a series of sexual assaults in Boston more than a decade ago waived extradition in New Jersey on Thursday and was set to return to Massachusetts, officials said. Matthew Nilo, 35, is charged with rape, kidnapping and assault counts from incidents that occurred in 2007 and 2008, Boston police said. Joseph Bonavolonta, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston field office, said Nilo was an ""accused serial rapist and kidnapper."" The FBI and Boston police arrested Nilo, who is formerly from the city’s North End, Tuesday outside his residence in Weehawken, Bonavolonta said. Four victims have been waiting years to learn the identity of their attacker, he said. ""We certainly realize that identifying this individual does not ease their pain — nothing can,"" Bonavolonta said at a news conference Tuesday. ""But hopefully it answers some questions."" Investigators used investigative genetic genealogy, which uses DNA analysis but also traditional genealogy to develop leads, to help identify Nilo, he said. Boston police requested help in October, and Nilo's identity was confirmed last month, he said. Nilo will plead not guilty, his attorney, Jeff Garrigan, told reporters Thursday. “He’s looking forward to fighting these charges and showing that he’s innocent,” Garrigan said. The sexual assaults occurred in the area of Terminal Street in the Charlestown neighborhood in August and November 2007 and August and December 2008, Boston police said. He is charged with three counts of aggravated rape, two counts of kidnapping, one count of assault with intent to rape and one count of indecent assault and battery, according to police. Nilo is an attorney who is from the Boston area, but after 2008 he also lived in Wisconsin, California and New York, Bonavolonta said. Cowbell, a company that advertises cyber insurance, employed Nilo but has since suspended him, a spokesperson said. The company, which hired Nilo in January after he passed a background check, has suspended him pending further investigation, spokesman Justin Finnegan said in an email. The company did not say what role he held. Authorities are asking anyone who thinks they were a victim or who has information to contact Boston police or the FBI. Suffolk County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Kevin Hayden said sexual assault cases are very challenging and difficult to solve. “These are events with lingering and often life-changing ramifications for our victims,” Hayden said. The technique used to identify Nilo is used to generate leads, but ""it's not the end-all,"" Bonavolonta said. ""There is a significant amount of investigative steps that have to occur even after we've identified who we believe to be, in this case, a suspect in an investigation to corroborate all of it,"" he said. It was also used to identify ""The Lady of the Dunes,"" the victim of Massachusetts' oldest unsolved homicide, as Ruth Marie Terry. Her body was found in 1974 on a Provincetown beach and remained unidentified until last year. Her killer has not been identified. "
32 Mississippi school districts still under federal desegregation orders,Associated Press,"June 1, 2023, 10:12 PM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 2:38 AM UTC",NBCBLK,"LEXINGTON, Miss. — There are 32 school districts in Mississippi still under federal desegregation orders, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division’s assistant attorney general said Thursday. Enforcing the open desegregation orders fit into a broader body of civil rights work launched in Mississippi that is examining jails, police departments and hate crimes in the state, according to Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. Referring to the U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation of public schools across the country, she said the Justice Department is ensuring school districts provide Black students in Mississippi with equal access to education programs. “In our ongoing efforts to fulfill the promise of Brown vs. Board of Education, we currently have 32 open cases with school districts here in Mississippi,” Clarke said. “And in each of those cases, we are working to ensure that these districts comply with desegregation orders from courts.” Clarke spoke to a small group of residents, local leaders and reporters Thursday at the Holmes County Circuit Court Complex in Lexington, about 62 miles from Jackson, the state capital. Mississippi is the latest stop in Clarke’s “listening tour” throughout the Deep South. The Justice Department is learning where to direct resources and where it might need to mount civil rights lawsuits, she said. Mississippi has the highest percentage of Black residents of any state. It has been home, as have other states, to legal fights over desegregation. In 2017, a Mississippi Delta school district agreed to merge two high schools after nearly 50 years of litigation in which the district sought to maintain historically Black and white schools. In addition to school districts, Clarke said at least five Mississippi jails and prisons have come under federal scrutiny. The department is looking into whether the facilities protect prisoners from violence and meet housing standards. The facilities include the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, the South Mississippi Correctional Institution, the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility, the Wilkinson County Correctional Facility and a Hinds County Jail. Clarke also said her division is investigating whether Rankin County Sheriff’s Deputies used excessive force when they shot Michael Corey Jenkins in the mouth during an alleged drug raid. An Associated Press investigation found that several deputies from the department have been involved in at least four violent encounters with Black men since 2019 that left two dead and another with lasting injuries. Clarke declined to offer more details about the case, citing an ongoing federal civil rights investigation. After delivering prepared remarks in Lexington, she met with community members about allegations of police brutality in the small town. Police have “terrorized” Black residents by subjecting them to false arrests, excessive force and intimidation, an ongoing federal lawsuit claims. “What I hope she’ll do is seriously address the issues. Not gloss over them, say that she has heard about these violations, talk about them in detail and say that it is wrong if it is happening,” said Jill Collen Jefferson, president of JULIAN, a civil rights organization that filed the federal lawsuit on behalf of a group of Lexington residents. The community meeting was closed to reporters. The Justice Department has not announced an investigation into the Lexington Police Department. Jefferson said her organization plans to file a class action lawsuit against the Lexington Police Department in the new few months. Against the backdrop of ongoing investigations into potential civil rights violations ensnaring school districts, jails and police departments is FBI data released in March showing the number of hate crimes in the U.S. rose in 2021. “Hate and bigotry are sadly on the rise,” she said.

Woman who refused tuberculosis treatment is in custody months after an arrest warrant was issued,Tim Stelloh,"June 2, 2023, 1:44 AM UTC",U.S. news,"A Washington state woman who repeatedly refused a judge’s orders to isolate or take medication for tuberculosis was arrested Thursday, more than three months after a rare civil arrest warrant was issued, officials said. The woman, identified in court documents as V.N., was detained and booked into a “negative pressure” room at the Pierce County Jail, a spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department said. The room is specially equipped for isolation, testing and treatment, the Tacoma-Pierce County Public Health Department said in a statement. The sheriff’s spokesman, Darren Moss Jr., said V.N. will not face criminal charges but has been ordered to remain at the jail for at least 45 days. “Depending on her treatment she could leave early or stay later,” he said in an email. Moss did not respond to questions about when the woman was taken into custody or where she was found. “We are hopeful she will choose to get the life-saving treatment she needs to treat her tuberculosis,” the health department said in a statement that thanked sheriff’s deputies “who supported public health with this necessary intervention.” V.N.’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening. Pierce County Superior Court Judge Philip Sorensen first ordered V.N.’s involuntary detention on Jan. 19, 2022, finding that health officials had made “reasonable efforts” to obtain voluntary compliance with public health rules for tuberculosis, a communicable disease that is deadly and contagious and can spread through the air when people who have it cough or sneeze. By February, public health officials said they had gone to Sorensen 16 times and asked him to enforce his detention order with a contempt warrant, a move the department called ""a last resort."" On Feb. 24, Sorensen signed the warrant. A corrections official said in a declaration filed with the court that authorities began surveilling V.N. in March to execute the warrant ""in a safe manner."" A deputy following V.N. watched her leave her home and board a city bus and go to a local casino, the official said. The deputy did not take her into custody; authorities have declined to say why. On May 19, after V.N. failed to appear at a court hearing, Sorensen again found her in contempt and said the warrant remained in effect. Nearly 100,000 cases of tuberculosis were recorded annually in the U.S. in the early 1950s. By 2021, the number had declined to 7,882, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pierce County gets roughly 20 active cases of the disease annually, according to the county Health Department. CORRECTION (June 1, 2023, 11:55 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of the judge in the case. He is Philip Sorensen, not Sorenson. "
Bill Cosby faces new sexual assault lawsuits after states extend statutes of limitations,Doha Madani,"June 1, 2023, 11:41 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Bill Cosby faces new lawsuits from women who have accused him of sexual misconduct decades ago, brought about by states’ passing laws that expand the window for sexual abuse accusers to take action. Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy model who has publicly accused Cosby of drugging her and raping her in 1969, sued him Thursday, now that California legislators have temporarily allowed sexual abuse lawsuits in cases that exceed the 10-year statute of limitations. Valentino, 80, says she never thought when she came forward that she would ever see any form of tangible justice in her case. “No matter how much of a settlement comes out of this, and if, you know, if nothing comes out of it, it doesn’t matter, because it will never replace what was taken from me,” Valentino said. All details Valentino shared to NBC News about the alleged incident are also in the lawsuit. She said she met Cosby in 1969 when she went for an audition after her 6-year-old son died. She said she remembers telling Cosby about the death, a drowning, but didn’t hear from him again until she and her roommate ran into him at Café Figaro in Los Angeles. “I was surprised, but he saw me sitting there crying, because I was having a hell of a day,” she said, referring to her grief over her son. Cosby offered to pay for a spa for her and her roommate, Valentino said, and offered to take them to dinner afterward. She said that she didn’t want to go but that it appeared that Cosby, who had just starred in the hit show “I Spy,” seemed sincere in his offer. “We weren’t looking for a date, but, you know, when the big star of this popular television series is offering to reach out to you seemingly in sympathy, you know, you kind of can’t turn it down,” she said. At dinner, Cosby offered her and her roommate a pill and said it would make them “all feel better,” Valentino said. She said that she believes he faked taking his own pill and that he put a second one directly in her and her roommate’s mouths. They began to feel unwell and asked to go home, Valentino said. But instead of driving them home, she said, Cosby took them to a townhome where he said he wanted to show them his “I Spy” awards. Valentino said she thinks she must have passed out after Cosby got them out of the car, because, she said, she woke up in a room with Cosby sitting by her roommate. “He looked like he was getting ready to pounce on a little mouse,” she said. “And then I saw a bulge in his pants, and I knew he was going to rape her while she was unconscious. I just felt very protective of her, and I tried to distract him.” She said that she began grasping at Cosby, who was out of her reach, and that she couldn’t quite form words in her state. Cosby then came over to her, she said, seemingly angry at her attempts to stop him. Valentino said that when she stood up, she immediately felt her legs collapse beneath her and ended up kneeling in front of Cosby, who was on a love seat. Cosby then orally and vaginally raped her, according to her retelling and her lawsuit. Andrew Wyatt, Cosby’s spokesperson, accused Valentino in a statement Thursday of having no “proof or facts” and of going from “town to town” with her allegations. He also alleged that the legislation that allowed her suit was a violation of Cosby’s constitutional rights. Cosby has consistently denied all allegations of sexual misconduct. “What graveyard can Mr. Cosby visit, in order to dig up potential witnesses to testify on his behalf?” Wyatt said. “America is continuing to see that this a formula to make sure that no more Black Men in America accumulate the American Dream that was secured by Mr. Cosby.” Valentino pushed back against accusations that the allegations against Cosby, whom 60 women have accused of sexual abuse, had anything to do with his being Black. “Andrew Wyatt has tried to make it seem as though it’s about race, but it’s not about race,” she said, adding that Cosby “was an equal opportunity rapist and probably the most prolific serial rapist of the 20th century. This is about rape, not race.” Cosby was convicted in Pennsylvania on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault in 2018, charged with drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. The case was overturned in 2021. The state Supreme Court vacated the sentence, finding that he was denied protection against self-incrimination. Cosby has no criminal convictions. Valentino’s lawsuit was filed under a new California law that created a window of time in which adult victims of sexual assault can file for civil damages even if the statute of limitations has expired. The law expanded previous legislation that extended the statute of limitations for minors alleging sexual abuse. Valentino said she was absolutely stunned when she learned about the change that would allow her to face Cosby in court. She also said she knew she had to see her allegations through. “There is no statute of limitations on murder, and rape is a murder of the soul,” Valentino said. “It’s a life sentence for the victim, so why should the rapist get any less? It’s time for a reckoning.” Similar measures, referred to as “look back windows,” have passed in New York and New Jersey. Five women sued Cosby in New York in December, accusing him of sexual assault, which his representatives have denied. Cosby was also found civilly liable last year of molesting Judy Huth at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in 1975, when she was 16 years old; his attorneys called her a liar. Nevada passed a law, SB129, which was signed Wednesday, eliminating the civil statute of limitations in sexual abuse cases involving adults, a substantial change to the previous two-year limit. The change is also likely to bring forth more legal challenges for Cosby, as accuser Lise-Lotte Lublin is a Nevada resident. Lublin has publicly accused Cosby of drugging her at a hotel in Las Vegas in 1989. Her husband, Benjamin Lublin, said that he was told about the incident when they started dating 23 years ago but that they both saw the situation in a new light after Janice Dickinson came forward accusing Cosby of assault. His wife decided to file a police report in 2014. “I had to sit outside, and when she came out, she was crying,” Lublin said. “I asked her, ‘Well, what’s wrong?’ And she said they can’t do anything. ... And the detective turned to me and said it’s because of the statute of limitations. I said, ‘What the hell is the statute of limitations?’” The couple, both born and raised in Nevada, have spent years supporting legislation to expand statutes of limitations in their state. When a similar version of SB129 failed to pass in 2019, Lublin said, they almost gave up. But then the couple went to support Huth in her California case, he said. “I saw Judy in the court with Lise, and we both saw how strong she was and how she was fighting, you know, to seek justice,” Lublin said. “That re-energized us. ... Because once I saw that, if this was possible in California, then it is possible in Nevada.” Nevada state Sen. Lisa Krasner, a primary sponsor of SB129, said she was motivated to make sure victims and survivors of sexual assault could seek justice. The bill, which passed unanimously in the state Senate, would allow people time to come to terms with what happened to them and seek justice, Krasner said. “They still have to go in front of a courtroom, in front of a judge and a jury of their peers,” Krasner said. “They still have to have evidence. They still have to prove their case. So there’s a lot of hurdles they must cross, but it keeps the courtroom doors open so that they have the ability to bring their case if they want to.” It’s important that lawmakers work to ensure people feel they are able to seek justice, Krasner said. Asked about the Nevada law and the possibility of another suit against Cosby, Wyatt said it was “interesting” that such laws were being passed in the states where Cosby’s accusers lived. “Mr. Cosby is a citizen of these United States, but these judges and lawmakers are consistently allowing these civil suits to flood their dockets — knowing that these women are not fighting for victims — but for their addiction to massive amounts of media attention and greed,” Wyatt said. Cosby has denied Lublin’s allegations. Lublin said he and his wife have spoken to an attorney about a future suit against Cosby, as well as reached out to fellow Cosby accusers who might have interest in a civil case. He also supported Valentino, whom he called a friend, in her case in California. Lublin described his wife and the other women who have come forward as warriors. “This is personal, because this happened to my wife, and we’ve been seeking justice for so many years because of Cosby,” Lublin said. “And this is personal because for decades upon decades upon decades in Nevada, Bill Cosby has hid behind the statute of limitations. And that day is over, and we’re coming for him.” "
Medicare plans to pay for Alzheimer's drugs that win full FDA approval,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"June 1, 2023, 8:38 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 10:22 PM UTC",Health news,"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said Thursday that it will pay for new Alzheimer’s drugs that are granted full approval from the Food and Drug Administration, although it will require physicians to collect data about how well the drugs perform in the real world. It's expected to help more Alzheimer's patients afford the new drugs. The change, which CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure announced in a news release, is a win for advocacy groups, including the Alzheimer's Association, that have been seeking broader access to a newer class of medications that have shown signs in clinical trials of slowing the progression of the disease. About 6.7 million people over age 65 have Alzheimer's in the U.S. and could qualify for coverage under Medicare. “Alzheimer’s disease takes a toll on not just the people suffering from the disease but also on their loved ones and caregivers in a way that almost no other illness does,” Brooks-LaSure said in a statement. Until now, Medicare would pay for those medications — which have been granted a fast-tracked version of approval called accelerated approval — only if patients were enrolled in a clinical trial. Two drugs have been granted accelerated approval: Biogen's Aduhelm and Eisai's Leqembi. Accelerated approval is for medications that “fill an unmet medical need,” according to the FDA. To gain full approval, the drugmakers need to conduct additional clinical trials. Doctors who prescribe the drugs will have to use a government registry to track how well patients are doing. In a statement Thursday, the Alzheimer's Association said requiring physicians to submit data in a registry is an ""unnecessary barrier."" ""We look forward to learning more details from CMS and we are hopeful for the future of health care access for our constituents,"" the group said in a statement. A panel of experts is expected to vote on whether to recommend that the FDA grant full approval to Leqembi at an FDA advisory committee meeting on June 9. Clinical trials showed the drug appeared to slow the progression of the disease in people with mild cognitive impairment or at an early stage. The medication costs $26,500 a year, putting it out of reach for most people. But if the advisory committee meeting goes well and the FDA grants traditional approval, people on Medicare who want the drug should be able to get it under the new Medicare rules.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

"Head of JPMorgan Chase says he never met Jeffrey Epstein, who kept millions at the bank for 15 years",Chloe Atkins,"June 1, 2023, 9:59 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The head of JPMorgan Chase said that he had never met disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and never even heard of him until Epstein’s 2019 arrest, and that he wasn’t aware of the bank’s internal investigation of its relationship with Epstein, who kept much of his fortune at the bank for 15 years. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was deposed last week by lawyers for plaintiffs suing the bank over its alleged role in enabling Epstein’s sex trafficking, as well as a lawyer for a former Chase executive whom the nation’s largest bank blames for prolonging its ties to Epstein. Epstein, who pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008, died by suicide in jail in 2019 after being rearrested and charged with trafficking. During the deposition, Dimon said he didn’t “recall knowing anything about Jeffrey Epstein until the stories broke sometime in 2019,” adding he was “surprised that I didn’t even, had never even heard of the guy, pretty much, and how involved he was with so many people,” according to the transcript. When a lawyer asked if he had ever heard “the name Jeffrey Epstein” prior to his 2019 arrest, Dimon responded, “Not that I recall.” Chase has been sued by the U.S. Virgin Islands and a victim of Epstein’s identified as “Jane Doe 1” over its links with Epstein, who kept money at the bank from 1998 to 2013. The financial institution has denied liability. “JPMorgan’s banking relationship with Epstein was known at the highest levels of the bank,” the U.S. Virgin Islands alleged in its complaint, referring to an August 2008 internal email that states, “I would count Epstein’s assets as a probable outflow for '08 ($120mm or so?) as I can’t imagine it will stay (pending Dimon review).” But according to the transcript Dimon testified that he was not informed by anyone at the bank that Epstein had entered a guilty plea to soliciting a minor in Florida in 2008. Dimon said he also wasn’t aware that in 2008 the bank reviewed whether Epstein should remain a JPMorgan Chase customer due to his plea. At one point, Dimon argued that the bank’s former general counsel, Steve Cutler, was the “ultimate decider” in keeping Epstein as a client and “had the ability to override” other executives’ decisions at the bank. He said that Cutler “had the ultimate authority to kick him out if he thought it had gone that far.” Cutler joined JPMorgan Chase in 2007 and served as the general counsel for nine years. As general counsel, he was head of the company’s legal and compliance activities worldwide and reported to Dimon. In 2011, Cutler sent an email about Epstein to Mary Erdoes, now head of asset and wealth management at JPMorgan Chase, and Jes Staley, then head of JPMorgan Chase’s private bank, which was dedicated to wealthy clients like Epstein. Cutler said Epstein was “not an honorable person in any way” and “he should not be a client,” the transcript showed. An attorney for the Virgin Islands read the email to Dimon during his questioning. Dimon responded that he wasn’t “aware at the time” of the email. Cutler “testified under oath that Jes Staley and Mary Erdoes made the decision to retain Epstein as a customer of the bank,” the Virgin Islands’ attorney told Dimon, the transcript showed. The same attorney also asked Dimon if “as CEO of private bank or asset and wealth management, Mary Erdoes could have decided to terminate Jeffrey Epstein as a customer, as a client of JPMorgan, is that right?” according to the transcript. Dimon responded, “I generally would say that’s true, yes.” Dimon said that he trusted and respected Cutler and Erdoes, and that he thought “they were both trying to do the right thing.” “Had the firm believed he was engaged in an ongoing sex trafficking operation, Epstein would not have been retained as client,” a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday night. “In hindsight, we regret he was ever a client.” Cutler did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. Via a Chase spokesperson, Erdoes declined to comment. The bank sued Staley in March, saying he repeatedly “thwarted” its efforts to cut ties with Epstein during his tenure at the bank. In May, a federal judge denied Staley’s motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the bank. During Dimon’s deposition, he denied repeatedly that he had spoken to Staley about Epstein. David Boies, a lawyer for Jane Doe, asked Dimon about a 2010 message to Epstein from an assistant asking about food preferences for an evening appointment with “Jes and Jamie,” the transcript showed. “I have never had an appointment with Jeff Epstein,” Dimon said. “I’ve never met Jeff Epstein. I never knew Jeff Epstein. I never went to Jeff Epstein’s house. I never had a meal with Jeff Epstein.” Dimon did testify that there was “a chance” Staley knew about Epstein’s misconduct. Staley worked at JPMorgan Chase for over 30 years, leaving to work for Barclays. In 2021 he stepped down as Barclays’ CEO after a probe into his relationship with Epstein. Staley has previously expressed regret for his affiliation with Epstein. "
Georgia gun shop owner shutters store after mass shootings targeting children,David K. Li,"June 1, 2023, 7:31 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 8:50 PM UTC",Guns in America,"A gun store owner near Atlanta said he is closing his store after his conscience was burdened by recent mass shootings that targeted young victims. Jon Waldman, 43, opened Georgia Ballistics in Duluth in March 2021, and post-pandemic business has been steady ever since, he said. But a pair of recent attacks, one at a Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee, and another inside an Atlanta hospital, were the final straws for Waldman, who said that his shop is already closed and that he plans to have all weapons cleared out by June 15. ""There’s no guilt about it. I sell to law-abiding citizens,"" Waldman said Thursday. He said he reached the point of worrying that any weapon he sells, even to someone who will never commit a crime, could end up in the wrong hands. “I’m not against the Second Amendment. But just with my conscience, I can’t sell it, because I don’t know who it’s going to affect and hurt,"" he said. ""That’s what eats at me,"" he said. ""If it can happen, it’s only a matter of time until it does happen."" Two recent shootings led Waldman to his decision, he said. A former student of The Covenant School in Nashville killed three children and three adults at the campus on March 27, officials said. Police shot and killed the shooter. “That really affected me,” Waldman said. “And then the shooting at Midtown [Atlanta] — this just has to stop. Dude killed a woman from the CDC who only wanted to help others. So I just can’t. That was the final straws.” On May 3, a 24-year-old man opened fire in an Atlanta hospital, killing a woman and wounding four others, before he was captured, police said. Waldman said that if he hadn't already decided to close his shop, another reason presented itself six weeks ago when a customer wanted to buy 4,000 rounds. Even 1,000 would have been reasonable, but four times that amount, Waldman said, made him question his field. ""If you had ordered 200 to 1,000 rounds, that's fine. Anyone who shoots regularly, you're going through a thousand rounds in a month,"" he said. ""But when you order 4,000 rounds, the kind of stuff that goes through engine blocks, refrigerators and vests that police officers wear, I just can't sell that,"" he said. Waldman insisted he's not pushing for greater restrictions on firearm ownership but is only advocating for more gun safety. ""I am more of a training and learning advocate,"" he said. ""I am more about training and safety than I am 'everybody should just have one.' You should be able to safely have one."" He said too many gun owners don't pay the same attention to their firearms as to their cellphones. “For the last couple of months, you just see kids, over and over again, getting shot,"" Waldman said. ""It's kids being randomly shot, and I'm tired of it. I have a kid. My girlfriend has two kids. I’m a family man. I’m all about people being armed, but at the same time, they leave their stuff in their cars. They don’t see their firearms [to be as important] as their phones.” Shannon Watts, the founder of the gun violence prevention group Moms Demand Action, praised Waldman for linking firearms to threats against children. ""This moral character being displayed by this one Georgia man — prioritizing children’s lives over gun-related profits — is sorely needed among right-wing Republican lawmakers in America,"" Watts said Thursday. Asked about Waldman's concerns about young victims, Kris Brown, the president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, said too many children are hurt by firearms every day in the U.S. ""We hear every day about a child, sometimes as young as 3 or 4 years old, getting their hands on their parents’ gun and accidentally shooting a loved one, or themselves,"" Brown said in a statement to NBC News. ""That’s because gun owners are for the most part not legally required to safely store their firearms. Eight kids a day are unintentionally killed or injured by these instances of ‘family fire.’” "
"S.C. store owner who killed teen previously shot at people he suspected of shoplifting, authorities say",Minyvonne Burke,"June 1, 2023, 6:39 PM UTC",Guns in America,"A South Carolina convenience store owner who fatally shot a 14-year-old in the back after falsely accusing him of stealing was involved in at least two prior altercations in which he confronted people he suspected of shoplifting and then opened fire, authorities said. As the owner, Rick Chow, remained in jail awaiting a bond hearing in the death of Cyrus Carmack-Belton, the Richland County Sheriff’s Department on Wednesday revealed it had received numerous calls about trouble at the Xpress Mart Shell gas station. In one incident in 2015, Chow fired six times at a car after he tried to stop someone he suspected of shoplifting, it said. Three years later, he shot a man in the leg, department spokesperson Veronica Hill said. Chow’s conduct in both cases “did not meet the requirements under South Carolina law to support criminal charges,” she said, adding authorities made that determination because he wasn’t the instigator in either incident. An incident report stated that in May 2015, Chow allegedly tried to stop a woman from stealing two cases of beer and a package of boiled peanuts. Chow confronted the woman in the parking lot. The woman, who was not identified in the report, told him that she purchased the items and he said she had not. The woman and Chow “began to struggle over the items"" and she ""began to yell for help” from a man seated inside her vehicle, the report stated. The woman allegedly threatened to shoot Chow, Hill said. Chow grabbed the beer and the woman’s purse, which contained the peanuts, according to the report. The scuffle left Chow with two scratches and a broken glasses, the report said. As the man and the woman attempted to drive away, Chow pulled out a handgun and fired about six shots at the vehicle, according to the report. No one was injured, Hill said. Deputies responded but could not find the man and the woman, the report said. Three years later, Chow said he watched a man take a can of Easy-Off cleaner from a shelf, conceal it under his clothes and then leave the store without paying, an incident report stated. Chow followed the man, Alexis Aguilera, 23, out of the store and demanded the item back, it said. Aguilera told him to call the police. Chow said he was “unsure of what happened next” but was struck in the face and the can of Easy-Off fell to the ground, according to the report. Chow then pulled out his firearm and fired two shots at Aguilera as he fled, the report stated. Aguilera returned to the scene as a deputy arrived, according to the report. He was taken to the hospital and treated for a gunshot wound before being taken into custody in connection with the incident. Aguilera pleaded guilty to a shoplifting charge, court records show, and was sentenced to 30 days or a $300 fine. Publicly listed numbers were not available for Aguilera. Chow’s attorney declined to discuss the earlier incidents. The shootings were just two examples of prior incidents at the store. During the past five years, the sheriff’s department has received hundreds of calls from the store ranging from assaults, larceny and shoplifting to motor vehicle theft, vandalism, robbery and burglary, according to Hill. On Sunday, Chow, 58, fatally shot Cyrus after accusing the 14-year-old of stealing bottles of water. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott said the teen “did not shoplift anything.” “We have no evidence that he stole anything whatsoever,” he said at a news briefing. Cyrus entered the convenience store around 8 p.m. Sunday. Lott said the teen took four bottles of water from a cooler and then put them back. Hill, the department spokesperson, said Wednesday that there is video showing the teen either setting down the water bottles or putting them back. At some point, the teen got into an argument with Chow and Chow’s son. Lott didn’t detail what led to the dispute but said that Cyrus eventually left the store and took off running. Chow, armed with a pistol, and his son chased the 14-year-old toward a nearby apartment complex, Lott said, adding that the teen fell at one point but got back up. Chow’s son said Cyrus had a gun, which is when the owner shot the teen in the back as he was running away, according to Lott. Authorities later recovered a gun next to his body, but the sheriff said there was no evidence the teen ever pointed the weapon at Chow or his son. Cyrus was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. An investigation determined the shooting was “not a bias motivated incident,” according to a report from the sheriff’s department. Hill said authorities reached that conclusion because investigators have no evidence that suggests racial bias was a factor. Cyrus was Black. Chow is Asian. The shooting has angered some people in the community. “It’s senseless,” Lott said. “It doesn’t make sense. You have a family that’s grieving. We have a community that’s grieving over a 14-year-old who was shot.” He said that even if Cyrus took something from the store, it didn’t warrant a shooting. “Regardless, even if he had shoplifted four bottles of water, which is what he initially took out the cooler and then he put them back, even if he had done that, that’s not — that’s not something you shoot anybody over, much less a 14-year-old,” Lott said. Democratic state Rep. Todd Rutherford, the attorney for the teen’s family, said in an Instagram post that what happened “wasn’t an accident. It’s something that the Black community has experienced for generations: being racially profiled, then shot down in the street like a dog.” “Words can’t describe the pain I feel having known this family for decades,” he said. Rutherford could not be reached for comment. Some people on social media have called for a boycott of the store and on Monday, a crowd gathered outside to protest. The report stated that several people broke into the store and took items off the shelves. Chow is being held at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center on a murder charge. His son has not been charged. The sheriff’s department said it has consulted with the Fifth Circuit Solicitor's Office seeking its opinion on whether the son should be charged. The solicitor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. "
"Texas murder suspect calls police and tells them, 'You’re looking for me'",David K. Li,"June 1, 2023, 5:20 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A murder suspect phoned Texas police and confessed to multiple slayings, telling them, ""You're looking for me,"" triggering a manhunt that led to his arrest this week, authorities said. Marshals and police captured Raul Meza Jr., 62, in Austin on Monday, five days after his chilling call to homicide detectives, officials said. Meza had been called a person of interest in the fatal stabbing of Jesse Fraga, an 80-year-old man whose body was found on May 20 in nearby Pflugerville. Meza called police on May 24 and told them he was aware he was being sought, Austin police Detective Patrick Reed told reporters on Tuesday. ""The caller stated, 'My name is Raul Meza, and you’re looking for me,'” Reed said. Meza confessed to killing Fraga, revealing details of the murder not disclosed to the public, before admitting to another homicide, Reed said. “'I got out (of prison) in 2016, I end up murdering a lady soon afterwards. It was on Sara Drive,'"" Meza told police, according to Reed. Jail records did not indicate whether Meza had hired a lawyer or had a public defender assigned to him. The 2019 strangulation of Gloria Lofton, 66, on Sara Drive in Austin had been unsolved, but DNA from the crime scene matched Meza's, police said. Meza had been known to stay in hotels close to Interstate 35 in and around Austin, and a fugitive task force arrested him at one of them on Monday evening. ""Raul Meza was considered armed and dangerous,"" Deputy U.S. Marshal Brandon Filla said. ""He was suicidal and had violence tendencies."" Authorities found zip ties, duct tape, a flashlight, a .22-caliber pistol and rounds on Meza when he was arrested, Filla said. Reed said that Meza on Monday night admitted to planning more murders. Meza ""was ready and prepared to kill again, and he was looking forward to it,"" Reed said. Police said they are looking into possible links between Meza and several unsolved murders going back to the 1990s. ""There is a good possibility that we will find additional cases,"" Austin police Detective Katy Conner said. “Right now, we have between between eight and 10 cases that kind of fit these similar circumstances that we’re looking at, but that can obviously grow,” she said. Meza served 11 years behind bars for the Jan. 3, 1982, murder and sexual assault of an 8-year-old girl, police said. Bruce Mills, now the interim assistant city manager of Austin, was a city police sergeant leading the investigation in that 1982 case. He told reporters Tuesday that police were developing a strong case against Meza before prosecutors made a plea bargain with him for a 30-year sentence, which turned out to be 11 years of actual time behind bars. ""I remember it like it was yesterday,"" Mills said of the murder investigation. ""We  were shocked, disappointed with no real explanation as to why this case didn’t go to trial. We never got solid answers to that."" ""Here’s a serial killer that justice was not served,"" Mills added. ""It was a travesty of justice."" A representative for Travis County District Attorney José Garza could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday. The county's top prosecutor in 1982 was Ronnie Earle, who died in 2020. A representative for his family could not be reached for comment. The building that now houses the Travis County DA operations was named in honor of Earle in 2018. "
Train carrying hazardous materials derails and closes highway in Minnesota,Marlene Lenthang,"June 1, 2023, 3:23 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A train containing some hazardous materials derailed Wednesday in northwest Minnesota near the Canada border, forcing the closure of a highway, officials said. Twenty-four cars of a Canada Pacific Kansas City train carrying mixed freight derailed in an unpopulated area in Kittson County, 4 miles south of Lancaster, at 4:30 p.m. local time, the railway company said. The Lancaster Fire Department said some of the cars were carrying an unspecified flammable liquid, which stayed confined to within the cars. “The initial assessment by first responders on the scene is that there are no leaks from our rail cars,” Canada Pacific Kansas City said in a statement. There was no fire and no waterways near the scene. The cause of the derailment is under investigation. Emergency response teams, including hazardous materials experts, were deployed to the scene, the railway said. Gov. Tim Walz tweeted Wednesday night, “Glad to hear that no injuries are reported and the site is contained.” “Experts are on the way to survey the site and make sure the community has everything they need,” he said. The Minnesota Department of Transportation said Highway 59 south of Lancaster was closed Wednesday evening due “to a train derailment.” The department said the highway would remain closed to allow local responders, rail inspectors and cleanup crews to do their work, which could take two to three days. The incident was the latest derailment in Minnesota. Last weekend, a train derailed near St. Cloud, spilling tons of rock. In March, a train derailed near Raymond causing a spill of ethanol and corn syrup. "
"Most Americans say companies should publicly support LGBTQ community, survey finds","Brandon Gomez, CNBC","June 1, 2023, 3:05 PM UTC",OUT News,"A clear majority of Americans who don’t identify as LGBTQ believe companies should publicly support the community, according to a new survey from gay rights organization GLAAD. About 70% of more than 2,500 adults who don’t identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or an otherwise member of the community said support from companies should come through hiring practices, advertising and sponsorships, according to online responses to GLAAD’s annual “Accelerating Acceptance"" study, conducted in February. “When people are exposed to LGBTQ people and experiences in media it changes hearts and minds and shifts culture and sentiment,” GLAAD said in its release. “Measuring comfortability in media is a pathway to 100% acceptance for LGBTQ people.” Three out of 4 survey respondents said they feel comfortable seeing LGBTQ people in advertisements, and nearly 70% reported feeling comfortable seeing an LGBTQ family with children included in ads. The study comes as retailers like Target, Kohl’s and PetSmart have come under attack for their annual LGBTQ Pride merchandise displays and ad campaigns. Mega retailer Target went as far as to pull some of its merchandise from the retail floor last week. A spokesperson for the company said threats to employees were “impacting our team members’ sense of safety and wellbeing while at work.” Critics continue to incite anti-LGBTQ attacks in stores and on social media, with some calling for boycotts. In April, Bud Light came under fire after partnering with transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The campaign prompted violent videos of customers shooting cans of Bud Light and a right-wing boycott. In response, the marketing executive who oversaw the partnership at Bud Light parent company Anheuser-Busch Inbev took a leave of absence. Sales of Bud Light since then continue to suffer, according to data by Evercore ISI. In the week ended May 20, Bud Light sales volume — the number of units of beer sold — declined 29.5% compared with the same period last year. The company has also faced criticism from LGBTQ leaders who have dinged the company for not defending its ties with Mulvaney and the community more strongly. In a statement responding to the backlash, Anheuser-Busch said it “works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics.” GLAAD and more than 100 leading LGBTQ advocacy organizations wrote a letter on Wednesday calling on Target to “reject and speak out against anti-LGBTQ+ extremism going into Pride Month,” which is celebrated in June. “Doubling down on your values is not only the right thing to do,” the group wrote in a statement. “It’s good for business.” A separate survey conducted by GLAAD and the Edelman Trust Institute in December found that if a brand publicly supports and demonstrates a commitment to expanding and protecting LGBTQ+ rights, Americans are twice as likely to buy or use the brand. GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis emphasized in her personal call to action on Twitter last week that companies need to stand behind their products and ad campaigns instead of backing down. “Anti-LGBTQ violence and hate should not be winning in America,” said Ellis. “But it will continue to until corporate leaders step up as heroes for their LGBTQ employees and consumers and do not cave to fringe activists calling for censorship.” This article originally appeared on CNBC.com.

Kim Cattrall couldn't stay away from 'Sex and the City' role after all,"Liz Calvario, TODAY","May 31, 2023, 11:44 PM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 12:52 PM UTC",Celebrity,"Kim Cattrall is stepping back into Samantha Jones' shoes. The official “And Just Like That...” Twitter account confirmed on Wednesday that Kim Cattrall will reprise her “Sex and the City” role in the second season of the Max show. She was not part of the show's first season. “Secret’s out!!” the account wrote, retweeting a report on Cattrall’s return. A spokesperson for Max also confirmed Cattrall’s return as Samantha Jones in “And Just Like That…” to NBC News. Reps for Cattrall did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Season Two of “And Just Like That...” will premiere June 22 and will also see the return of John Corbett as Aidan Shaw and Candice Bergen’s character Enid Frick. Cattrall has not been a part of the revival series and publicly said she was done with the show amid an alleged feud with star Sarah Jessica Parker. Fans last saw the outspoken PR maven in the second “Sex and the City” movie in 2010. Cattrall made comments about her relationship with her former co-stars, telling Piers Morgan in 2017 that Parker “could have been nice” and that their relationships were “toxic.” Parker said she was “heartbroken” by Cattrall’s comments. Cattrall told Variety in 2022 that she wasn’t asked to join “And Just Like That...” She also said she was ready to say goodbye to Samantha after filming “Sex and the City 2” because her character not progressing. Later that year, Parker confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that Cattrall was never approached for the HBO reboot. “We did not ask her to be part of this because she made it clear that that wasn’t something she wanted to pursue, and it no longer felt comfortable for us, and so it didn’t occur to us,” Parker said.

"3 teens arrested after killing and eating New York village's prized swan, police say",Chantal Da Silva,"June 1, 2023, 9:38 AM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 12:03 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Three teenagers have been arrested and accused of stealing a swan prized by its community in upstate New York, killing the beloved bird and eating it over the Memorial Day weekend, officials said. Police in Manlius, a southeast suburb of Syracuse, sounded the alarm this week after Faye, one of the village's most iconic residents, and four of her baby swans, known as cygnets, were reported missing after a Memorial Day parade. ""Unfortunately, the investigation led to the discovery that Faye ... had been killed over the weekend,"" Manlius police said in an update Tuesday. Not only was the swan slain; she was later eaten by the teenagers and ""family,"" Police Sgt. Ken Hatter said at a news conference. He said the teens sneaked into the pond area “in the middle of the night” and pounced on the bird as she was nesting. “She wasn’t fighting back, and they were able to capture her,” he said, adding that the swan was killed at the pond. Hatter said the teenagers initially believed the swan was “just a very large duck.” After they killed the bird, the teens took its remains back to the house of one of their aunts, where it was cooked, Hatter said in separate comments, according to The Associated Press. The four cygnets were found safe and are in the care of a biologist tasked with overseeing the health and well-being of Manlius’ swans, Hatter said at the news conference. The teenagers were arrested Tuesday after someone spotted two baby swans in a store in nearby Salina and called authorities, Hatter said. One of the suspects, a juvenile who was working at the store, confessed to having taken the birds along with two other teenagers, he said. The suspect spoke of planning to raise the birds as pets and had no plans to eat them. The three teens face grand larceny, criminal mischief and other charges, Hatter said. Two are juveniles, he said. The third, who is 18, had a hunting license, he said. Hunting swans is legal in a number of states, but New York is not one of them. Manlius has been known for its swans for more than a century, with its swan pond long serving as a local landmark and signs and banners across the village emblazoned with an image of the bird. ""We’ve had swans for over 100 years. We’re going to continue to have swans. It’s part of this village,"" Mayor Paul Whorrall said at the news conference. Faye is not the only swan who will be missing from the pond, however. Whorrall said her mate, Manny, is expected to be moved to another location because of concerns over how he will react to having lost his partner. The pair had called the village pond their home for over a decade. Swans, Whorrall noted, are known to form monogamous bonds and can ""mate forever"" with a single partner. With Faye gone, he said, there is a possibility Manny could become ""combative"" and pose a threat to the four cygnets once they are returned to the pond. ""We will let the four cygnets grow up, and we are hoping that two of those cygnets will mate, and then we will be back to the way it used to be,"" Whorrall said. Social media users expressed sadness, one writing on Twitter: “This is actually devastating. These swans are not only part of the fabric of the Village of Manlius, they’re a special part of this entire community.” “I’m crushed and I know others are feeling the same,” the person said. Whorrall said steps were being taken to ensure the safety of the swans, including placing security cameras around the pond. “This is not ending. We will continue to have swans and hopefully at some point get back to normal,"" he said. "
"Man who escaped from Ohio prison drowned, autopsy shows",The Associated Press,"June 1, 2023, 10:17 AM UTC",U.S. news,"HENDERSON, Ky. — A man who escaped from a northwest Ohio prison this month drowned, according to autopsy results released Wednesday. Bradley Gillespie, 50, was reported missing May 23 from the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima along with another man who authorities said escaped alongside him. Authorities determined the two escaped by concealing themselves in a trash container. The other man, James Lee, 47, was caught the next day in Henderson, Kentucky, after a police pursuit of a stolen car the men were in ended in a crash and a foot chase, but Gillespie avoided capture. His body was spotted Sunday in the Ohio River, not far from the area where he was last seen. Henderson is a city across the river from Indiana and about 350 miles southwest of Lima. The Henderson County coroner’s office released the preliminary autopsy results Wednesday and said toxicology results won’t be available for several weeks. Gillespie was imprisoned since 2016 and was convicted of a double homicide. Lee was serving a sentence imposed in 2021 for burglary and safecracking. A major and three corrections officers at the prison have been placed on paid administrative leave, and similar action may be taken against others as the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction’s internal investigation continues, officials have said. A criminal investigation by the Ohio State Highway Patrol is also ongoing. "
'What happened to Ray?' Family of Native American man killed by Border Patrol in Arizona wants to know why he was shot,Julia Ainsley,"June 1, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",U.S. news,"A relative of a Native American man who was killed by Border Patrol agents near the Arizona-Mexico border two weeks ago said she was talking to him moments before he was shot and he told her he had contacted the Border Patrol earlier in the evening to ask for help. But the relative said none of the law enforcement agencies investigating the May 18 shooting death of Raymond Mattia has asked her or any other family members for information, and Customs and Border Protection’s official statement about the incident makes no mention of a call from Mattia. The relative said that she has been pressing law enforcement for information about the shooting since it happened, without success — and that the family was not even allowed to approach his body for hours. “I asked that night: ‘We want to talk to someone. What happened to Ray? We need answers,’” said the relative, who preferred to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation by law enforcement. Now she wants to know: “Why did the Border Patrol run into the yard instead of assessing? Why were there so many gunshots? Why didn’t you try talking to Ray?” According to the relative, who lives close to Mattia’s house, Mattia regularly called the Border Patrol to report migrants crossing his property on Tohono O’odham Nation tribal land. The 4,000-square-mile reservation in the desert west of Tucson shares a long border with Mexico. The relative said the Border Patrol had frequent interactions with him. The relative said that if she were contacted by the FBI or Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility, two federal entities investigating the shooting, she would tell investigators that around 6 p.m. on May 18, Mattia told her he had called the Border Patrol to complain about three undocumented migrants who had entered his home and asked to use his telephone and bathroom. More than three hours later, she said, she and Mattia were talking on the phone again when Border Patrol vehicles raced into his yard. He believed they were responding to his call and told her he would go talk to them. He hung up, she said, and then she heard gunshots. A statement about the incident from CBP makes no mention of the alleged earlier call from Mattia. Instead, it says the Border Patrol agents were assisting Tohono O’odham tribal police to respond to a “shots fired call.” The discrepancy may explain why Mattia went out of his house to meet the agents, thinking they were responding to his earlier request, while the agents, according to CBP’s statement, “spread out to search for the man.” The statement said CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility has reviewed video taken from body cameras worn on the agents and deciphered that Mattia threw an object at the agents, which landed a few feet away from them, and “abruptly extended his right arm,” causing them to shoot. According to Mattia’s relative, she was not aware of any shots fired in the area that evening before the Border Patrol and tribal police arrived. She said there is no electricity at Mattia's home, making visibility for law enforcement officers difficult at 9:35 p.m. The relative also said the object Mattia threw may have been his cellphone, because he had just ended his call with her when he approached the agents. Neither CBP nor the FBI, which oversees all shooting investigations on tribal land, have said what Mattia threw. They did not respond to a request for comment about why none of the relatives have been interviewed, when the body camera video would be made public or whether the Border Patrol knew whether Mattia had made a call to them earlier in the day before they arrived at his house. The incident may further corrode trust between the Border Patrol and the Tohono O’odham Nation. “My uncle didn’t deserve to die like this,” Yvonne Nevarez, Mattia’s niece, told The Arizona Republic. “After this happened, we feel like we can’t trust [the Border Patrol] to come when there’s issues.” According to Mattia’s relative, who rushed to the site of the shooting, a Tohono O’odham police officer blocked family members from seeing his body. She said that the officer told them to go home but that the family members told the officers they needed to stay with their brother and bless his body. She said they did not see Mattia until he was in a body bag on his way to the medical examiner. The Tohono O’odham Police Department did not respond to a request for comment about why the family was blocked from seeing Mattia. “We said our goodbyes while he was in a body bag,” the relative said. “The elders said it was very disrespectful.” The next morning, the relative said, all the crime scene tape around Mattia’s house had been removed, but no law enforcement officers or agents came to speak with the family about what happened. “It looked like the whole investigation was over,” the relative said. “But no one ever came to talk to us.” Last weekend, the family organized two protests outside Border Patrol stations in Tucson and near the Tohono O’odham Nation Reservation to demand answers about Mattia’s death.

"What is berberine, the supplement dubbed 'nature's Ozempic' on social media?",Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"June 1, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Health news,"A dietary supplement called berberine is gaining momentum on social media for its weight loss effects, even being referred to by some as “nature’s Ozempic,” in reference to the popular drug that can help people shed pounds. Users say berberine, which is found in a number of plants, including barberry plants, helps curb appetite and improve blood sugar levels, resulting in weight loss. Google searches for “berberine” began to increase at the end of March before they spiked in late May. Berberine is rising in popularity as demand increases for medications like Ozempic and Wegovy, known for their weight loss effects. Ozempic and Wegovy are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, which mimic a hormone that helps reduce food intake and appetite. They are highly effective, but they are in short supply in the U.S. They are also expensive — around $1,000 or more out of pocket — and need to be prescribed by a doctor. By comparison, berberine appears to be widely available online, and it usually ranges in price from $15 to $40 for a month’s supply. ""You don’t have to deal with a doctor, and it’s going to be a lot less expensive,” said Dr. Pieter Cohen, who researches supplement use at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Somerville, Massachusetts. “So from an advertising perspective, it’s perfect.” But that doesn’t mean berberine is effective, or safe, for weight loss. Here’s what to know about it, including how well it works and whether it’s safe. Many of the claims about berberine haven’t been verified by large, peer-reviewed studies — and the bulk of the research has been conducted in mice, not humans, experts say. A meta-analysis of 49 studies published last year in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition found berberine may provide metabolic benefits in people, mainly for the heart, although there may be small benefits for weight loss. “It’s not a dramatic weight loss average for berberine,” said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity medicine specialist and the equity director of the endocrine division at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The studies show it is “between a quarter of BMI point to one BMI point, which is nowhere near what you see on average with semaglutide,” she said, referring to the drug found in Ozempic. Stanford wasn’t involved in the research. For people in those studies, the optimal dose appeared to be 1 gram per day, Stanford said. Cohen was more cautious about using the compound for weight loss. Because dietary supplements aren’t reviewed or approved by the Food and Drug Administration, they can be promoted for just about any health claim, Cohen said. Supplements can also contain inaccurate amounts of the compound or contain other ingredients that aren’t listed on the label. “An active pharmaceutical drug like berberine, it’s not the kind of thing that you should just be taking willy-nilly,” he said. What’s more, how the supplement supports weight loss — if at all — is largely unknown, Cohen said. “People are saying it is like metformin, but it is not,” said Dr. Holly Lofton, the director of the weight management program at NYU Langone Health, referring to a medication people with diabetes use to lower their blood sugar levels. She said she isn’t recommending berberine for weight loss. Medications derived from plants aren’t uncommon, Cohen said. Highly effective drugs, including aspirin and morphine, come from plants. Known side effects of berberine in humans include nausea and vomiting, Stanford said. In animal studies, it appeared to enlarge the liver and the kidney and reduce the number of white blood cells, which fight off infections. Larger studies would need to be conducted to know whether there are any serious side effects in humans. Stanford said she would recommend speaking with a doctor before taking berberine as a part of a weight loss regime. It may not be safe for pregnant women, she added. “These don’t go through any FDA approval or regulation,” she said. “You might work with someone that has some knowledge, whether it be an MD or naturopathic physician.” If there are any side effects, stop taking the medication, she said. Cohen said that despite the potential benefits for weight loss, it’s “not worth the risk.” In fact, he said, if people do experience weight loss using berberine, they should stop taking it immediately and talk to a doctor. “That could suggest that something is wrong with the product you’re taking and you might be exposed to something that’s more dangerous than berberine,” he said.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

Search for man who fell off Carnival cruise ship near Florida is suspended,Phil Helsel,"June 1, 2023, 4:15 AM UTC",U.S. news,"The Coast Guard on Wednesday night suspended the search for a cruise ship passenger who is believed to have fallen into the sea east of Florida on Monday morning, officials said. Ronnie Peale, 35, was identified as the passenger who fell about 4 a.m. as the Carnival Magic cruise ship was around 180 miles east of Jacksonville. “The decision to suspend the active search efforts pending further development is never one we take lightly. We offer our most sincere condolences to Mr. Peale’s family and friends,"" Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Hooper said in a statement. The Coast Guard said it was notified around 6:30 p.m. Monday that a passenger had fallen. The search involved HC-130 Hercules airplanes, a HC-144 plane and a cutter, which is a ship. More than 5,171 square miles were searched, the Coast Guard said. The Carnival Magic is around 1,000 feet long and has a capacity of almost 3,700 passengers, in addition to around 1,300 crew members, according to the cruise company.

Teen birthrates hit another record low as progress starts to slow,Kaitlin Sullivan,"June 1, 2023, 4:01 AM UTC",Health news,"The teen birthrate in the U.S. reached another record low last year, with signs that there may not be much room left for improvement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report published Thursday. Teen birthrates fell 3% in 2022, the report found — a smaller decrease than in previous years. Since 2007, the teen birthrate has decreased about 8% per year. The smaller decline last year could indicate the nation is reaching a plateau thanks to years of progress, experts say. “If there are a lot of states where the rates are already low, they bottom out. They can’t get any lower,” said the report’s lead author, Brady Hamilton, a statistician and demographer at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Hamilton noted that the data in the new report are provisional and will be updated once the final numbers for 2022 are available. Access to both contraception and comprehensive sex education has driven the sharp decrease in teen births, which are down nearly 80% from what they were in the early 1990s. “Declining birthrates, especially among those in their teens and early 20s, is a good thing, because a lot of these pregnancies are unplanned,” said Karen Guzzo, the director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “This means people are having babies when they want to.” For many people, that means having children later in life. Birthrates in women ages 35 to 39 rose 2% in 2022, the report found. For women ages 40 to 44 — who have had near-continuous increases since 1985 — the birthrate rose 4%. Women ages 45 and up had an even greater increase in birthrate, at 12%, though the overall number of births to women that age remained low. Waiting to have kids is a trend across all nations with low or moderate fertility rates, such as most of Europe, said Joshua Goldstein, the director of the Berkeley Population Center at the University of California, Berkeley. That’s usually a good thing, but researchers are left with questions about why it is happening. “It probably means that more women are having children when they want to have children.  They’ve had chances to get better education, better chances to find the right partner, more chances to excel in their career,” Goldstein said. The CDC report included data from more than 99% of birth records for babies born in the U.S. last year. It found that overall, the birthrate declined by a marginal amount, less than 1%, in 2022. Aside from a small uptick in 2021, the number of babies born in the U.S. has been falling steadily since 2007. Since that year, birthrates have consistently been below the rate needed for a generation to replace itself. Goldstein said he isn’t concerned that not enough people in the U.S. are becoming parents. “It’s not the size of the next generation that matters. It’s the contribution that generation can make. The fact that women are able to have children at the ages they want and invest in those children is a positive thing,” he said. The data also doesn’t yet reveal clues about how many people are choosing not to have children at all. Because people — both men and women — are waiting until later in life to have kids, it will take years of tracking population data to determine whether or not people are forgoing children altogether. “This conversation is always framed as why are women choosing to not have kids, but young men are not having kids, either,” Guzzo said, noting that younger people often don’t feel ready to be parents, often because of finances. “This is not a story about women being too career-driven. This is a story about what happens when young people try to transition in society and whether or not they have the resources to build another generation of people,” she said. The number of women in their childbearing years is also declining in the U.S. “The biggest thing is the age structure of the U.S. population is changing. The age structure is very different now compared with a decade or two decades ago. The number of women who are at reproductive age is shrinking,” said Feinian Chen, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University. Where it differs is among immigrants. Younger immigrants moving to the U.S. and having children is one explanation for why birthrates are so much higher among Asian and Hispanic women compared to American Indian and Alaska Natives and Black and white Americans, Chen said. Total births among American Indian or Alaska Native and white women declined by 3%, and the number of babies born to Black mothers declined 1%. Birthrates among Asian women increased 2%, and the number of babies born to Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and Hispanic mothers increased 6%. “Immigrants have been propping up our population rates for a long time,” Guzzo said.

Former limo company operator sentenced in crash that killed 20 in New York,Phil Helsel,"June 1, 2023, 2:27 AM UTC",U.S. news,"The former operator of a New York limousine company who was convicted of manslaughter in a deadly 2018 crash was sentenced to at least five years in prison Wednesday. Twenty people died in the crash in Schoharie, in upstate New York, on Oct. 6, 2018. Nauman Hussain, the operator of the company the limo was rented from, Prestige Limousine, was convicted of manslaughter on May 17. Judge Peter Lynch on Wednesday sentenced Hussain to an indeterminate sentence of at least five years and a maximum of 15 years in prison. Hussain, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, made no comments and walked with his head down after he was sentenced. “There’s a sense of relief that we got through a long journey,” Kevin Cushing, whose 31-year-old son, Patrick Cushing, was killed in the crash, told reporters, adding that there could be an appeal. “We know that we’re not finished, but this was a great step forward for the families.” Hussain’s attorney said they an appeal is planned, NBC affiliate WNYT of Albany reported. Lynch, the judge, rejected a proposed plea deal last year that would have spared Hussain from serving prison time. The driver, all 17 passengers and two pedestrians died when the 2001 Ford Excursion stretch limousine crashed in Schoharie, a city of a little more than 29,000 around 30 miles west of Albany. A group of friends had rented the limo for a surprise party. It crashed after its brakes failed to slow it on a hill, investigators said. The National Transportation Safety Board said the limo company’s “egregious disregard for safety” led to the brake failure and the crash. The vehicle reached a speed of more than 100 mph on the steep hill before it crashed. The NTSB also blamed poor oversight by the state Transportation Department. It said that the Transportation Department's oversight was ineffective and that it knew of Prestige’s multiple out-of-service violations. The department also failed to properly register the limo, which allowed the company to evade safety and inspection requirements, it said. New York changed its laws regarding commercial vehicle safety after the tragedy. Cushing told reporters his son was a sportsman who wanted life to be fair. Patrick Cushing’s girlfriend and some of his best friends also died in the crash. “Things happen in life where it isn’t fair,” Cushing said. “In this case, this certainly wasn’t fair to the 20 individuals who lost their lives.” "
Hawaii man pleads guilty and is fined following death of Yellowstone bison calf,Phil Helsel,"June 1, 2023, 1:10 AM UTC",U.S. news,"A visitor to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming pleaded guilty to a federal charge and was fined after he helped a bison calf, which was later euthanized after its herd rejected it, officials said. Clifford Walters, of Hawaii, pleaded guilty to one count of feeding, touching, teasing, frightening or intentionally disturbing wildlife, the U.S. attorney's office for Wyoming said. He was ordered to pay around $1,000 in a fine and payment to the park's wildlife fund, the U.S. attorney's office said in a statement. On May 20, Walters helped a newborn bison calf out of the Lamar River after the animal became separated from its herd, the National Park Service said. But the herd rejected the calf, which can happen when humans interfere with wildlife, according to the park. Staff members killed the calf because it was abandoned and because it was ""causing a hazardous situation by approaching cars and people along the roadway,"" the park said in a statement. There was nothing to indicate Walters acted maliciously, federal prosecutors said. Walters represented himself, court records show. He declined to comment Wednesday. Yellowstone has explained its decision to euthanize the calf instead of send it to a sanctuary or care for it by saying state and federal regulations prohibit transferring bison out of Yellowstone except for scientific research or meat processing. The park also said that it is there to preserve natural processes and that it is not a zoo. It said that as many of 25% of bison calves born this spring will die but that they will benefit other animals by feeding them. ""Allowing this cycle of life to play out aligns most closely with the stewardship responsibility entrusted to us by the American people. Unfortunately, the calf’s behavior on roads and around people was hazardous, so rangers had to intervene: but the calf’s body was left on the landscape,"" it said. Park officials have stressed that visitors should give wildlife space by staying at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and at least 25 yards away from other animals. The sentence handed down for Walters included a $500 fine and a $500 payment to Yellowstone's wildlife protection fund, the U.S. attorney's office said. "
Actor Armie Hammer won’t face sexual assault charge,Diana Dasrath,"June 1, 2023, 12:11 AM UTC",U.S. news,"LOS ANGELES — Actor Armie Hammer will not face criminal charges in connection with allegations of sexual assault made in 2021, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said Wednesday. The district attorney’s office said there was insufficient evidence to charge Hammer, the star of “The Social Network” and “Call Me by Your Name.” “Due to the complexity of the relationship and inability to prove a non-consensual, forcible sexual encounter we are unable to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,” district attorney’s spokesperson Tiffiny Blacknell said in a statement. A woman, who has identified herself only as Effie, had publicly accused Hammer of sexual assault. Police confirmed in 2021 that detectives were investigating an allegation, and the case was forwarded to the district attorney’s office for review this year. In a statement Wednesday on Instagram, Hammer, 36, thanked supporters and those who helped him. “I am very grateful to the District Attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and coming to the conclusion that I have stood by this entire time, that no crime was committed,” he wrote. “I look forward to beginning what will be a long, difficult process of putting my life back together now that my name is cleared.” Effie said Wednesday she was disappointed. “I felt a duty to speak out and file a report in order to try to hold Armie accountable for all the harm and trauma he has caused me and in order to protect other women from experiencing similar abuse,” she said in a statement. The woman said that since she came forward, she has experienced death threats and harassment. Blacknell, the district attorney’s spokesperson, said that sexual assault cases are among the most difficult to prove and that the office assigns its most experienced prosecutors to review them. “As prosecutors, we have an ethical responsibility to only charge cases that we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt. We know that it is hard for women to report sexual assault,” she said. Effie has said she was 20 in 2016 when she began an affair with Hammer, who was married at the time, after they connected on Facebook. She claimed he raped her in 2017 and committed other acts of violence against her and said, ""I thought that he was going to kill me."" Hammer appeared in the 2010 film “The Social Network” as twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and he starred as Oliver in the 2017 film “Call Me by Your Name.” "
Bruce Willis’ daughter Tallulah reveals the first signs he had dementia,"Liz Calvario, TODAY","May 31, 2023, 11:49 PM UTC",Pop Culture News,"Tallulah Willis is reflecting on father Bruce Willis’ health struggles. In February, the 68-year-old actor’s family revealed that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, after first announcing in March 2022 that he would be retiring from acting after his aphasia diagnosis, which affects the ability to express and understand written and spoken language. Tallulah Willis, the 29-year-old daughter of the “Die Hard” star, wrote about how she knew something was wrong with her father in an emotional essay for Vogue. Willis said she had suspected a potential illness “for a long time.” “It started out with a kind of vague unresponsiveness, which the family chalked up to Hollywood hearing loss: ‘Speak up! ‘Die Hard’ messed with Dad’s ears,’” she wrote in the Vogue essay. “Later that unresponsiveness broadened, and I sometimes took it personally. He had had two babies with my stepmother, Emma Heming Willis, and I thought he’d lost interest in me.” Bruce Willis shares three daughters — Tallulah, Scout, 31, and Rumer, 34 — with ex-wife Demi Moore. He is also father to Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9, with wife Emma Willis. “Though this couldn’t have been further from the truth, my adolescent brain tortured itself with some faulty math: I’m not beautiful enough for my mother, I’m not interesting enough for my father,” Tallulah Willis wrote, also touching on her own issues with body dysmorphia and a borderline personality disorder diagnosis. She shared that in recent years she was in denial about her father’s health declining due to her own health issues, which also included anorexia nervosa and an ADHD diagnosis. Throughout all this, she wrote, “my dad was quietly struggling.” “All kinds of cognitive testing was being conducted, but we didn’t have an acronym yet,” she said. “I had managed to give my central dad-feeling canal an epidural; the good feelings weren’t really there, the bad feelings weren’t really there.” But in summer 2021, it “painfully” hit her that her father’s health was declining. It happened when she was at a wedding on Martha’s Vineyard and the bride’s father gave a moving speech. “Suddenly I realized that I would never get that moment, my dad speaking about me in adulthood at my wedding. It was devastating,” she recalled. “I left the dinner table, stepped outside, and wept in the bushes.” Now in her own recovery, Willis said that she has the tools to be present in her life “and especially in my relationship with my dad.” “I can bring him an energy that’s bright and sunny, no matter where I’ve been,” she said, adding that in the past she was afraid of “being destroyed by sadness.” “I can savor that time, hold my dad’s hand, and feel that it’s wonderful. I know that trials are looming, that this is the beginning of grief, but that whole thing about loving yourself before you can love somebody else — it’s real,” she said. Willis also shared how when she visits her father, she takes a lot of photos and looks at things from a new perspective. She also saves every voicemail from him on a hard drive. “I find that I’m trying to document, to build a record for the day when he isn’t there to remind me of him and of us,” she shared. She wrote that his dementia has not affected his mobility and that he still remembers who she is “and lights up when I enter the room.” “He may always know who I am, give or take the occasional bad day,” she wrote, noting that one difference between frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease is, “at least early in the disease, the former is characterized by language and motor deficits, while the latter features more memory loss.” Amid her father's diagnosis, Tallulah Willis is focusing on her family’s wellbeing and how she can make her father more comfortable. After sister Rumer welcomed her daughter, Louetta, earlier this year, she is soaking it all in. “There’s this little creature changing by the hour, and there’s this thing happening with my dad that can shift so quickly and unpredictably. It feels like a unique and special time in my family, and I’m just so glad to be here for it,” she wrote. Dr. Jagan Pillai, a neurologist with Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, previously told TODAY.com that the life expectancy for someone with frontotmeporal dementia depends on the parts of the brain affected, how severely they are affected and the rate of disease progression. The Cleveland Clinic has noted that the average life expectancy after a diagnosis of FTD is 7.5 years, while the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration gave a range of 7 to 13 years. "
Police video shows a car rocketing off a tow truck on a Georgia highway,Tim Stelloh,"May 31, 2023, 11:48 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A Florida driver was seriously injured after her car “vaulted” off a tow truck ramp on a Georgia highway in a dramatic crash that was captured on a police officer’s body camera, authorities said Wednesday. The incident occurred May 24 after an unrelated crash on the same highway in the southern part of the state, a spokeswoman for the Georgia State Patrol said in an email. Around 11:20 a.m., the truck was getting ready to load a wrecked vehicle and was parked in the highway's eastbound left lane with its emergency lights on, according to a state patrol crash report. Body camera video from an officer at the scene captured a car identified in the crash report as a 2014 Nissan Altima driving toward the truck's ramp. The report doesn't say how fast the driver was moving. It identifies the posted speed limit in the area as 65 mph. In the video, the Nissan drives up the ramp and launches into the air. The car slowly flips as it soars over the truck's cab and driver, who's standing near the vehicle's front bumper, and appears to land on its roof before it rolls over on the road. The crash report says the Nissan vaulted about 120 feet before it struck another car on the highway. The Nissan's driver, identified in the report as a Tallahassee woman born in 2001, was hospitalized with serious injuries, the spokeswoman said. Her condition wasn't immediately clear. A second driver was also hospitalized, according to the report. It wasn't clear what the driver was doing before the crash, the spokeswoman said. Efforts to reach her Wednesday were unsuccessful. "
A New York man is fired after a woman accused him of ripping her wig off in the street,Claretta Bellamy,"May 31, 2023, 11:40 PM UTC",NBCBLK,"A woman whose wig was ripped off her head by a man as she was walking in New York City early Monday said she now wants to take legal action. The woman, known online as Lizzy Ashliegh, posted a video on TikTok of an incident that she said took place near Penn Station around 1 a.m., when a man ripped off a turquoise wig from her head. In the video, which had over 500,000 views Wednesday evening, Ashliegh, who is audibly distraught, asks the man, “For what reason did you take my wig off?” The man appears intoxicated  and laughs when he is questioned. “Why did you do that?” Ashliegh asks the man. “What makes you think that that’s OK?” The video shows that two people were with the man and that they encouraged him to apologize. Ashliegh, who is a creative director, actor and singer, posted another TikTok video later in the morning explaining how her wig was secured with combs, highlighting the excessive force the man used when he ripped it off her head. “If you pull the wig, it looks like it’s going to come off, right, but it gets stuck, because it has combs in it,” Ashliegh says in the video. “So he ended up pulling my hair.” Ashliegh’s initial TikTok video got hundreds of comments from TikTok users who ultimately helped identify the man as Anthony P. Orlich, who worked as a litigator for Leader Berkon Colao and Silverstein LLP, a law practice based in New York. The firm declined to comment, directing NBC News to a statement posted Tuesday on LinkedIn announcing Orlich’s termination. “We have been made aware of a video of a non-work related incident involving one of our associates circulating on social media,” the statement read. “We take seriously any inappropriate behavior by any employee, whether inside or outside the workplace. This associate is no longer with the Firm.” The firm’s post prompted comments from dozens of people on LinkedIn, including some Black users, who said that Orlich should be charged with assault and that his termination is not enough. A request for comment sent to Orlich’s previous work email was returned with a notice saying he “is no longer with Leader Berkon Colao & Silverstein LLP.” Attempts to reach Orlich through phone numbers listed under his name were unsuccessful. Ashliegh did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ashliegh she thanked her followers in another TikTok video she posted Monday, noting that people “found him in less than 12 hours.” She said she also filed a police report later that day and visited a doctor, who told her that her “neck area is very tense” and prescribed a muscle relaxer, she said. The New York Police Department said it could not provide any details. In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, Ashliegh said she is “unable to say more at the moment as I move forward legally.” She told her followers she would share any updates with them. "
Danny Masterson found guilty of rape,Diana Dasrath,"May 31, 2023, 9:16 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 10:27 PM UTC",#MeToo Reckoning,"LOS ANGELES — “That ’70s Show” star Danny Masterson was convicted on two counts of rape Wednesday at his retrial in Los Angeles. The seven-woman, five-man jury could not reach a verdict on a third count, which alleged Masterson raped a former girlfriend, after having deliberated for over a week, The Associated Press reported. Masterson, 47, was led from the courtroom in handcuffs while his wife, the actor and model Bijou Phillips, wept. His family and friends sat in stunned silence. He faces up to 30 years in prison at his sentencing, set for Aug. 4. The verdict came some six months after Masterson’s first trial, at which he also faced charges of raping three women he met through the Church of Scientology, ended in a mistrial, with jurors leaning toward acquittal. He was charged with raping the three women — identified at trial as Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2 and Jane Doe #3 — at his Hollywood Hills home from 2001 to 2003. All three accusers are former members of the Church of Scientology, to which Masterson still belongs. “I am experiencing a complex array of emotions — relief, exhaustion, strength, sadness — knowing that my abuser, Danny Masterson, will face accountability for his criminal behavior,"" Jane Doe #2 said after the verdict was handed down. ""I am disappointed that he was not convicted on all counts, but take great solace in the fact that he, the Church of Scientology, and others, will have to fully account for their abhorrent actions in civil court.” Jane Doe #3, whose count the jury did not convict Masterson on, said she was ""devastated that he has dodged criminal accountability for his heinous conduct against me. "" ""Despite my disappointment in this outcome, I remain determined to secure justice, including in civil court, where I, along with my co-plaintiffs, will shine a light on how Scientology and other conspirators enabled and sought to cover up Masterson’s monstrous behavior,” she said. Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón thanked all of the women who came forward. ""Their courage and strength have been an inspiration to us all,"" Gascón said in a release after the verdict. “While we are disappointed that the jury did not convict on all counts, we respect their decision. The verdicts handed down by the jury in this case were undoubtedly a difficult one to reach and we thank the jurors for their service."" Just as in his first trial, Masterson did not take the stand. And his defense attorneys declined to call any witnesses. Masterson, who has been free on bail since his June 2020 arrest by the Los Angeles Police Department’s Robbery-Homicide Division, has steadfastly denied all of the allegations. He has also denied assaulting a fourth woman, identified as Jane Doe #4, who told the court at his first trial he had raped her, too. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo initially denied the prosecution’s request to put Jane Doe #4 on the stand in the first trial, but she changed her mind after prosecutors argued that Masterson’s lawyer opened the door by suggesting that his three other accusers colluded against him. Masterson was not charged with raping the fourth woman. Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller put Jane Doe #4 on the stand again at Masterson’s retrial along with a fifth woman, who testified that Masterson raped her in 2000 after a cast party in Toronto, Deadline reported. The fifth woman did not testify in the first trial. Unlike Masterson and the three Jane Does he was charged with raping, the additional witnesses are not Scientologists. Both trials focused a lot of unwanted attention on the Church of Scientology, which the Jane Does have accused of trying to cover up the allegations. At the retrial, Olmedo made it clear once again that Scientology was not a defendant. But she again allowed witnesses to testify that church officials pressured them not to talk to police about the rape allegations. Scientology spokeswoman Karin Pouw has denied those allegations and insisted, repeatedly, that church doctrine requires members to “abide by all the laws of the land.” Diana Dasrath reported from Los Angeles and Corky Siemaszko from New York City. CORRECTION (May 31, 2023, 10:30 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified Reinhold Mueller. He is a deputy Los Angeles County district attorney, not the district attorney. "
Tenants of partially collapsed building in Iowa say complaints were ignored for years,Marlene Lenthang,"May 31, 2023, 8:58 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Former and recent tenants of the historic Iowa apartment building that partially collapsed over the weekend say they had complained to management for years about cracks in the walls, a lack of heat and air conditioning, and plumbing woes — but were consistently ignored. A portion of the 116-year-old, six-story Davenport building fell into a rubble heap Sunday evening, prompting a frantic evacuation. Authorities said Tuesday that five people are unaccounted for and two are thought to be inside the building. Since the collapse, people who once lived at 324 Main Street have shared their experiences with issues they said plagued the building and of feeling brushed off by management. Schlaan Murray, 46, moved out in February after a year. He said that while he lived at the building, he struggled with no AC or heat, faulty plumbing and a toilet that wasn't bolted to the floor. Murray said he contacted the building's management office, Village Property Management, more than 15 times with different complaints and only once was a maintenance worker sent to address the toilet problem. “My toilet was all cracked, it came off [the ground]. That was the only time, when I reached out, they did come and so-called fixed it,"" he said. ""All they did was put caulk on it."" He said he often complained about the lack of heating, especially during the Midwestern winter. One time after talking to management, he said he came home to find a small space heater at his front door, a move he called “a slap in the face.” Murray said he wasn't the only one suffering. “Every time I came in and there was a tenant there, we’d talk. Like 'Hey, is this going on? Is your heat working? Is your AC working?'"" Murray said despite messaging and calling management, ""nothing was ever done."" He said he notified the city of Davenport twice, leaving his contact information and complaint information, but never heard back. Village Property Management did not address the allegations of mishandling tenant complaints when reached for comment Wednesday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with our tenants and families during this difficult time,” a statement signed by Andrew Wold, who purchased the property in June 2021, and the property management team, said. “We have been working closely with the American Red Cross and other agencies to assist the displaced tenants affected by this event. We are forever grateful to them for all of their assistance with our tenants,” the brief statement said. "
"Months after Adidas cut ties with Kanye West, Yeezy shoes are back on sale",The Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 8:23 PM UTC",Business News,"Some of Adidas’ remaining Yeezy shoes are back on sale — months after the German sportswear company cut ties with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. Adidas ended its yearslong partnership with Ye in late October, in light of his antisemitic remarks and other harmful behavior. In the months that followed, the fate of $1.3 billion worth of unsold Yeezys remained unknown — until earlier this month, when Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden announced the company would be selling a portion of the remaining inventory and donating some of the proceeds to social justice organizations. The first batch of Adidas’ remaining Yeezys went on sale Wednesday. At this time, the sneakers appear to be available through Adidas’ app “Confirmed,” according to the retailer’s website. Part of the profits will be donated to organizations including the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change, Adidas says. Wednesday’s release marks the first time that Adidas has sold Yeezys since the partnership termination in October. The Yeezy products up for sale include already-existing designs as well as those that were initiated in 2022 and set to be released in 2023, Adidas previously noted. “We believe (selling and donating these Yeezys) is the best solution as it respects the created designs and produced shoes, it works for our people, resolves an inventory problem, and will have a positive impact in our communities,” Gulden said in an May 19 statement. At a May 11 annual shareholder meeting, Gulden explained the company made the decision to sell and donate Yeezys after speaking with nongovernmental organizations and groups that were harmed by Ye’s comments and actions. Some details of Adidas’ plans are still unclear — including how many Yeezys will eventually go on sale and what portion of sales will be donated. The Associated Press reached out to Adidas for further information Wednesday. Cutting ties with Ye cost Adidas hundreds of millions of dollars — contributing to a loss of $655 million in sales for the last three months of 2022, which helped drive the company to a quarterly net loss of 513 million euros. Adidas reported $441 million in lost sales at the start of 2023, the company announced this month. Net sales declined 1% in the first quarter, to 5.27 billion euros, the company said. It reported a net loss of 24 million euros, a plunge from a profit of 310 million euros in the same period a year ago. Operating profit, which excludes some items like taxes, was down to 60 million euros from 437 million euros a year earlier. Meanwhile, investors also filed a class-action lawsuit against Adidas in late April, alleging the company knew about offensive remarks and harmful behavior from Ye years before terminating its pact with him. Adidas has pushed back on the allegations. "
Alex Murdaugh pleads not guilty — for now — to federal wire fraud and money laundering charges,The Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 8:22 PM UTC",U.S. news,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — Alex Murdaugh was arraigned Wednesday on federal money laundering and wire fraud charges for indictments saying he stole money from his clients, and although he pleaded not guilty for now, his lawyer said that might change soon. Murdaugh is already serving a life sentence in a South Carolina state prison for killing his wife and son, and the details of the 22 financial charges aren’t new. State prosecutors have indicted Murdaugh on similar charges, saying he diverted money meant for clients and a wrongful death settlement for his family’s longtime housekeeper who fell at Murdaugh’s home to his own bank accounts. Murdaugh’s lawyers said in a statement last week the former attorney has been cooperating with federal investigators, and they anticipated the latest charges would be “quickly resolved without a trial.” A federal guilty plea to the charges that all carry at least 20 years in prison would guarantee a long time in prison for Murdaugh even if his pending appeal of his double murder conviction was successful. Murdaugh took the stand at his murder trial earlier this year to repeatedly deny shooting his 22-year-old son, Paul, and 52-year-old wife, Maggie, at their home. Prosecutors said he decided to kill them because his millions of dollars of theft was about to be discovered, and he was hoping their deaths would buy him sympathy and time to figure out a cover-up. Murdaugh, who turned 55 in a state prison cell in protective custody Saturday, also faces around 100 other state charges, including stealing from clients and his family’s law firm, insurance fraud and tax evasion. Prosecutors, Murdaugh’s attorneys and state Judge Clifton Newman, who presided over the murder trial, are trying to find court time to try at least some of those charges before Newman has to retire because of his age at the end of 2023. In federal court, Murdaugh faces 14 counts of money laundering, five counts of wire fraud, one count of bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. His longtime friend Cory Fleming — an old college roommate and godfather to one of his sons — pleaded guilty last week to conspiracy to commit wire fraud for his part in helping Murdaugh steal more than $4 million in wrongful-death settlements with insurers meant for the family of his longtime housekeeper Gloria Satterfield. The other allegations prosecutors detail in Murdaugh’s federal indictments already have been revealed in state legal papers. It said Murdaugh and a banker friend, Russell Laffitte, worked together to take settlement money out of client’s accounts, prosecutors said. Laffitte was convicted in November of six wire and bank fraud charges. Other federal indictments give detailed allegations of how Murdaugh created a bank account that had a similar name to a legitimate company that handled settlements to steal money from clients. "
"14-year-old fatally shot in the back by S.C. store owner who wrongly accused him of shoplifting, sheriff says",Mirna Alsharif,"May 30, 2023, 7:53 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 8:02 PM UTC",Guns in America,"A 14-year-old was fatally shot in the back Sunday by a South Carolina convenience store owner who wrongly accused him of shoplifting and chased him after a confrontation, authorities said. Rick Chow, 58, was arrested Monday and charged with murder in the death of Cyrus Carmack-Belton. “He did not shoplift anything,"" Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott told reporters at a news briefing Monday. ""We have no evidence that he stole anything whatsoever."" Cyrus entered the convenience store on Parklane Road in Columbia around 8 p.m., Lott said. At some point, the teenager, Chow and the owner’s son started arguing, said Lott, who didn't detail what led to the dispute. Eventually, Cyrus left the store and took off running, Lott added. The owner, armed with a pistol, and his son chased the teen toward a nearby apartment complex, Lott said, adding that Cyrus fell at one point but got back up. Chow’s son said Cyrus had a gun, which is when the owner shot him in the back as he was running away, Lott said. Authorities later recovered a gun next to the teen’s body, but the sheriff said there was no evidence the teen ever pointed the weapon at Chow or his son. The wound caused hemorrhaging and significant damage to Cyrus' heart, Richland County Coroner Naida Rutherford said. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. “It’s senseless,” Lott said. “It doesn’t make sense. You have a family that’s grieving. We have a community that’s grieving over a 14-year-old who was shot.” He said that even if Cyrus took something from the store, it didn’t warrant a shooting. ""Regardless, even if he had shoplifted four bottles of water, which is what he initially took out the cooler and then he put them back, even if he had done that, that's not — that's not something you shoot anybody over, much less a 14-year-old,"" Lott said. The investigation determined the shooting was “not a bias motivated incident,” according to a report from the sheriff’s department. Asked how authorities reached that conclusion, department spokesperson Veronica Hill said investigators have no evidence that suggests racial bias was a factor. Cyrus was Black. Chow is Asian. Democratic State Rep. Todd Rutherford, the attorney for the teen's family, said in an Instagram post that what happened to the teen ""wasn’t an accident. It’s something that the Black community has experienced for generations: being racially profiled, then shot down in the street like a dog. Words can’t describe the pain I feel having known this family for decades."" ""I’m asking that our community continue to wrap their arms around this family as they’ve joined the club that no Black family ever wants to be a part of. You’re outraged. I’m outraged,"" he added. In a statement, Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., said “this tragedy should have never happened,” adding Cyrus recently celebrated his eighth grade graduation from Summit Parkway Middle School. “The criminalization of Black men and boys and the historic trend of painting them as aggressors have time and again led to deadly and heartbreaking circumstances. Cyrus Carmack-Belton has since been declared innocent, but his supposed crime of shoplifting a bottle of water should not have cost him his life. I pray justice is swift,” he said in the statement. A crowd gathered outside the store Monday to protest, the report said. At 9:43 p.m., several people broke into the store and took items off the shelves, it said. Pictures of the aftermath show Cyrus' name spray-painted on the store, as well as broken glass and trash. Signs reading ""No child deserves to die over water"" and ""CLOSE IT DOWN"" were taped outside the store. Inside, racks were knocked down. Chow is being held at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center, the sheriff's department said. He made his first court appearance Tuesday. Wearing a navy jail jumpsuit, he did not talk about the shooting during the proceeding. A bond hearing will be held later. An attorney for Chow didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. "
Boiler explosion at southeastern Texas power plant kills contractor,The Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 6:37 PM UTC",U.S. news,"FRANKLIN, Texas — One person was killed when a boiler exploded at a southeastern Texas power plant Wednesday morning, according to a spokesperson for Dallas-based Luminant. “A contractor was fatally injured” in the blast about 8 a.m. at the Oak Grove Power Plant, according to a statement from spokesperson Meranda Cohn for Luminant, which owns the plant. “All other employees and contractors have been accounted for and there are no other known injuries at this time,” Cohn said.

Nun whose body shows little decay since 2019 death draws hundreds to rural Missouri,The Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 5:32 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Hundreds of people flocked to a small town in Missouri this week and last to see a nun whose body has barely decomposed since 2019. Some say it’s a sign of holiness in Catholicism, while others say the lack of decomposition may not be as rare as people think. Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster was exhumed in April, according to a statement from the Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles, in Gower, Missouri. The nuns had been preparing for the addition of a St. Joseph shrine, and that involved “the reinterment of the remains of our beloved foundress, Sister Wilhelmina,” the statement said. When they exhumed Lancaster, they were told to expect only bones, since she had been buried in a simple wooden coffin without any embalming four years ago. Instead, they discovered an intact body and “a perfectly preserved religious habit,” the statement said. The nuns hadn’t meant to publicize the discovery, but someone posted a private email publicly and “the news began to spread like wildfire.” Volunteers and local law enforcement have helped to manage the crowds in the town of roughly 1,800 people, as people have visited from all over the country to see and touch Lancaster’s body. “It was pretty amazing,” said Samuel Dawson, who is Catholic and visited from Kansas City with his son last week. “It was very peaceful. Just very reverent.” Dawson said there were a few hundred people when he visited and that he saw many out-of-state cars. Visitors were allowed to touch her, Dawson said, adding that the nuns “wanted to make her accessible to the public ... because in real life, she was always accessible to people.” The monastery said in a statement that Lancaster’s body will be placed in a glass shrine in their church on Monday. Visitors will still be able to see her body and take dirt from her grave, but they won’t be able to touch her. The Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph also released a statement. “The condition of the remains of Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster has understandably generated widespread interest and raised important questions,” the diocese said. “At the same time, it is important to protect the integrity of the mortal remains of Sister Wilhelmina to allow for a thorough investigation.” “Incorruptibility has been verified in the past, but it is very rare. There is a well-established process to pursue the cause for sainthood, but that has not been initiated in this case yet,” the diocese added. The Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles, also said that Lancaster has not yet reached the required minimum of five years since death for the sainthood process to begin. Rebecca George, an anthropology instructor at Western Carolina University in North Carolina, said the body’s lack of decomposition might not be as rare as people are expecting. George said the “mummification” of un-embalmed bodies is common at the university’s facility and the bodies could stay preserved for many years, if allowed to. Coffins and clothing also help to preserve bodies, she said. “Typically, when we bury people, we don’t exhume them. We don’t get to look at them a couple years out,” George said. “With 100 years, there might be nothing left. But when you’ve got just a few years out, this is not unexpected.” "
MLB players say drag troupe invited to Dodgers' Pride Night mocks Christianity,David K. Li,"May 31, 2023, 4:34 PM UTC",OUT News,"Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw and Washington Nationals pitcher Trevor Williams tore into Kershaw’s Los Angeles Dodgers for scheduling a Pride Night event that will include a popular satirical drag troupe. The Dodgers this month rescinded their invitation to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence to the team’s annual LGBTQ Pride event on June 16 before they did a second 180 and reinvited the decades-old charitable group of performers, who describe themselves as a ""leading-edge Order of queer and trans nuns."" But rather than put the dispute to bed, the Dodgers' invitation, rejection and re-engagement with the Sisters apparently has sparked anger in the two high-profile players, who believe the group is anti-Catholic. ""As a devout Catholic, I am deeply troubled by the Dodgers' decision to re-invite and honor the group 'The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence' at their Pride Night this year,"" Williams said in a statement Tuesday. ""To invite and honor a group that makes a blatant and deeply offensive mockery of my religion, and the religion of over 4 million people in Los Angeles county alone, undermines the values of respect and inclusivity that should be upheld by any organization."" And last week, at the behest of Kershaw, the Dodgers hastily scheduled a Christian Faith and Family Day at Dodger Stadium on July 30. The Christian event was regularly held at Dodger Stadium, with Kershaw as a primary organizer, through 2019. It hadn't been held since the pandemic, and Kershaw said he set on relaunching it this year — speeding up the planning once the team went forward with Pride Night with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. “I think we were always going to do Christian Faith Day this year, but I think the timing of our announcement was sped up,” Kershaw told the Los Angeles Times this week. “Picking a date and doing those different things was part of it, as well. Yes, it was in response to the highlighting of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence” by the Dodgers. Kershaw, a sure-fire Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher, insisted he has no other issue with the LGBTQ community and won't boycott his team's June 16 game against the San Francisco Giants. “This has nothing to do with the LGBTQ community or Pride or anything like that,” said Kershaw, a native of suburban Dallas. “This is simply a group that was making fun of a religion — that I don’t agree with.” Williams went a step further than Kershaw and called for Catholics to think twice about backing the Dodgers, one of the oldest and most storied franchises in baseball. ""I also encourage my fellow Catholics to reconsider their support of an organization that allows this type of mockery of its fans to occur,"" said Williams, a native of San Diego. ""I know I am not alone in my frustration, hurt, and disappointment about this situation."" A representative for the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence declined to comment specifically on the players’ remarks, saying it's not the group's ""place to comment on the personal opinion of these brilliant athletes."" ""Our mission is to help those in need and provide service and aid to the LGBTQ community,” Sister Dominia, the abbess of the Los Angeles Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, said as she read a prepared statement over the phone. “We accepted our nomination to the L.A. Dodgers for their recognition of our 27 years of service to Los Angles and the LGBTQ+ people. We thank the Dodgers for their support.” Sister Dominia also expressed gratitude that Kershaw isn’t boycotting the Pride Night game, calling his decision ""very Christian."" ""Neighbors are neighbors,"" she said. ""He has his beliefs. It’s OK. I’m not mad about anything. It’s all good.” On Tuesday, Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Anthony Bass apologized for asking consumers and his social media followers not to patronize companies that support LGBTQ rights, such as Target and Anheuser-Busch, which makes Bud Light. “I recognize yesterday ​​I made a post that was hurtful to the Pride community, which includes friends of mine and close family members of mine,” Bass said in a statement he read to reporters before Toronto's game against the visiting Milwaukee Brewers. “I am truly sorry for that.” Bass said he spoke to teammates about his social media post and promised to ""educate myself."" “As of right now, I am using the Blue Jays’ resources to better educate myself to make better decisions moving forward,” said Bass, a native of suburban Detroit. “The ballpark is for everybody. We include all fans at the ballpark. We want to welcome everybody. That’s all I have to say.” A representative for Major League Baseball could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday, and a spokesman for the MLB Players Association, the union representing players, declined to discuss the matter.

White man who pulled gun in MLK Day confrontation with Black teens gets probation,Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 4:12 PM UTC",Guns in America,"MIAMI — A white man was sentenced to probation in South Florida Tuesday for pulling a gun and yelling racial slurs in a traffic confrontation with a group of Black teenagers protesting housing inequality on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2019. As part of a deal with with prosecutors, Mark Bartlett, 55, pleaded guilty to a hate crime and aggravated assault and also agreed not to possess a firearm for a decade, the Miami Herald reported. Bartlett must also perform 300 hours of community service and take anger management classes and racial sensitivity training. Bartlett could have faced decades in prison, but Miami-Dade County Judge Alberto Milian granted Bartlett a withhold of adjudication, which means Bartlett will avoid a formal conviction. Bartlett had previously claimed he was acting in self-defense during the confrontation, but following a 2021 hearing Milian ruled that Bartlett did not act reasonably in getting out of his SUV and pulling a pistol on the teenage protesters who had stopped traffic near the Brickell Bridge in downtown Miami. Bartlett had testified that he was being held hostage as his SUV was stuck in traffic and that he was goaded into repeatedly using a slur. He acknowledged the slur is a derogatory term for a Black person but denied that it was racist. As a condition of his plea agreement, Bartlett apologized in court Tuesday and admitted that his words were hateful. Cellphone video taken by bystanders shows Bartlett carrying a handgun and yelling racial slurs at the teenagers on bicycles blocking traffic in downtown Miami. The protest involved potential loss of affordable housing in the impoverished Liberty City neighborhood of Miami. It coincided with a much larger event, “Wheels Up, Guns Down,” that was timed to coincide with Martin Luther King Jr. Day and involved mostly young Black men riding motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles in traffic, popping wheelies and riding while standing on the seats.

"Ezra Miller won't be recast if there's a sequel to ‘The Flash,’ director says",Variety,"May 31, 2023, 4:07 PM UTC",Pop Culture News,"Ezra Miller will continue being the Flash as long as Andy Muschietti is involved in the Warner Bros. superhero franchise, the director said. During an interview on upcoming episode of “The Discourse” podcast, Muschietti said he has no plans to recast Miller despite the actor’s history of legal troubles and alleged abuse. “If [a sequel] happens, yes,” Muschietti said about having Miller back as the Flash. “I don’t think there’s anyone that can play that character as well as they did. The other depictions of the character are great, but this particular vision of the character, they just excelled in doing it. And, as you said, the two Barrys — it feels like a character that was made for them.” “The Flash” producer Barbara Muschietti added, “In principal photography, Ezra was brilliant and the most committed and the most professional [actor]. Ezra gave everything for this role — physically, creatively, emotionally. They were absolutely supreme.” Miller was cited in Vermont with felony burglary last year. In 2020, the actor made headlines after a recording surfaced in which they appeared to be choking a woman outside of a bar in Iceland. No charges were filed. The actor was also arrested twice in Hawaii in 2022, once for disorderly conduct and harassment. In the Hawaii incidents, Miller pled no contest to a single count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct and paid a $500 fine and $30 in court costs. The harassment charge was dismissed. Variety exclusively reported last August that Miller was seeking treatment for “complex mental health issues” after going “through a time of intense crisis.” “I want to apologize to everyone that I have alarmed and upset with my past behavior,” Miller said in a statement at the time. “I am committed to doing the necessary work to get back to a healthy, safe and productive stage in my life.” Given that Muschietti’s “The Flash” was developed and filmed under the previous leadership at DC Studios, it’s unclear whether or not the Miller-starring tentpole will get a sequel or not (surely big box office grosses will help). James Gunn and Peter Safran are now in charge of DC Studios, but their first slate announcement did not include any word on a second go-around for Miller’s the Flash. Gunn has already hyped the film by calling it “one of the greatest superhero movies” ever made, while Safran has said that Miller’s future as the Flash depends on their continued recovery. “Ezra is completely committed to their recovery,” Safran said in January. “And we are fully supportive of that journey that they’re on right now. When the time is right, when they feel like they’re ready to have the discussion, we’ll all figure out what the best path forward is. But right now, they are completely focused on their recovery. And in our conversations with them over the last couple of months, it feels like they’re making enormous progress.” Warner Bros. unveiled “The Flash” in its entirety at CinemaCon in April. The tentpole earned strong first reactions from journalists in attendance. Andy Muschietti told press at the event, “Ezra is well now. We’re all hoping that they get better…They’re taking the steps to recovery. They’re dealing with mental health issues, but they’re well. We talked to them not too long ago, and they’re very committed to getting better.” “The Flash” production designer Paul Austerberry said earlier this month that most moviegoers would “forget” Miller’s history by the time the movie opened, thus it wouldn’t be a concern for the movie’s opening. “The Flash” opens in theaters nationwide June 16 from Warner Bros.

Sign with a homophobic slur in front of Florida business sparks backlash,Jay Valle,"May 31, 2023, 3:21 PM UTC",OUT News,"A sign with a homophobic slur outside a Florida auto repair shop has sparked backlash from the local community and social media users. The sign, which appeared to have gone up over Memorial Day weekend outside Rick’s Repair Shop in Tallahassee, said, “Veterans get a day fags and child molesters get a month why,” appearing to refer to Pride Month in June. Jackson Peel, a spokesperson for the Florida House Democrats, tweeted a photo of the sign and publicly denounced the message. “This kind of bigotry should have no place in our Tallahassee community,” Peel wrote. “It is an embarrassment and the people at Rick’s Repair Shop should be ashamed of their foolish, hurtful, and wrong words.” The viral post, which was shared Sunday, has been viewed over 900,000 times and received hundreds of responses. Tyler Clark-McLendon, the board chair of Tallahassee Pride, shared Peel’s tweet and said the shop “chose to have a hate-filled Memorial Day.” Tallahassee City Commissioner Jeremy Matlow also criticized the business, sharing Peel’s tweet and writing, “I’m not sure the sad, miserable place a person must be in to take the time to put this up, but I do know the majority of folks in Tallahassee reject this hatred and respect the freedom to be who you are, love who you want and support LGBTQ rights every month of the year.” Shop owner Rick Hughes is known in the community for sharing controversial messages outside his store, according to Peel. Hughes could not be reached for comment. Since the post, Rick’s Repair Shop has received hundreds of negative ratings and reviews on the business-review platform Yelp. Yelp posted a message Tuesday afternoon saying it had temporarily disabled the posting of new reviews to the shop’s page due to “increased public attention, which often means people come to this page to post their views on the news rather than actual consumer experiences with the business.” Earlier this month, drivers in Orlando, Florida, were met with a violent and homophobic message on the road, where a digital traffic sign that appeared to be tampered with displayed the message “KILL ALL GAYS.” Orlando police said the incident is under investigation, NBC affiliate WESH of Orlando reported. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer denounced the hateful message, calling the sign “disgusting” and saying “hate has no place in Orlando.” “To Orlando’s LGBTQ+ residents and visitors: you are respected and valued here,” Dyer tweeted. “And we won’t be deterred in our efforts to ensure that our city is inclusive for all.” "
"Body of missing Missouri ER doctor found in Arkansas, family says",The Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 1:57 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The body of a Missouri emergency room doctor who has been missing for more than a week has been found in northwest Arkansas, his brother told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Dr. John Forsyth was last heard from in text messages around 7 a.m. May 21. His brother, Richard Forsyth, said authorities called the family Tuesday night to say his brother was found deceased. He said he and other family members were waiting for more details from detectives. Messages left with the Missouri State Highway Patrol were not immediately returned. Police said John Forsyth, 49, was reported missing when he failed to show up for work May 21 at Mercy Hospital in Cassville, a town of 3,100 residents deep in the Missouri Ozarks. His black Infiniti was found parked in a remote area near an aquatic park in Cassville. The car was unlocked with his wallet, two phones and a laptop and other items inside. “It doesn’t seem like a person who left with a plan,” Richard Forsyth told the AP earlier Tuesday. “Right now, we really don’t have any breaks in the case. I’m confused, and I’m worried. And I don’t like this one bit.” Several law enforcement agencies, including the Missouri State Highway Patrol, searched about a 9-mile radius around the park using people, dogs and drones. Forsyth’s family set up a Facebook page seeking information. “My brother has now been missing for week. I’m grieving, I’m afraid, and it feels like the world has tipped into sheer chaos,” his sister, Tiffany Andelin, wrote Monday. Richard Forsyth said the last person his brother texted with was a woman to whom his brother had recently gotten engaged. The last time Richard saw him was a few days before he went missing. “We had dinner Wednesday before he disappeared, and we sat and talked for three hours,” Richard Forsyth said. “I told him this is the happiest I’d seen him in a long time. His divorce was final May 11, and I think that gave him energy for the future.” Phone and email messages left Tuesday with Cassville police were not immediately returned. Police have said there were no signs of foul play. Richard Forsyth said his brother had been at the Cassville hospital for about 15 years. He described John Forsyth as a doting father, family physician and part-time math nerd. “He really cared about his patients,” Richard Forsyth said, adding that his brother stayed in his RV near the hospital when he was on call. “And he loved his kids.” "
"Alec Baldwin gets a hip replacement after suffering 'intense chronic pain,' wife says",Marlene Lenthang,"May 31, 2023, 11:48 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Alec Baldwin has undergone hip replacement surgery after having suffered with “intense chronic pain,” his wife said on social media. Hilaria Baldwin revealed Tuesday on Instagram that her husband, 65, “got a new hip today…it was a long time necessary.” “We have been through so much together … as your partner and as you heal, I want so very much for you to leave this very intense chronic pain chapter behind and improve your quality of life,” she wrote. She thanked doctors and hospital staff members for “bringing him safely through this.” Baldwin commented on the post: “And you. Thanks to you.” It has been a tumultuous few years for Baldwin, who was accused of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of his Western movie “Rust” in New Mexico in October 2021. He was rehearsing with a pistol for a scene when the gun went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Last month, New Mexico prosecutors formally dismissed charges, saying ""new facts"" demanded further investigation. Prosecutors dismissed “without prejudice” the case, meaning new evidence could prompt them to refile charges. "
"Al Pacino, 83, is expecting a baby with girlfriend, Noor Alfallah, 29","Liz Calvario, TODAY","May 31, 2023, 7:43 AM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 11:40 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Al Pacino and his girlfriend, Noor Alfallah, are expecting their first child together, a representative for the 83-year-old actor confirmed. Alfallah, 29, is eight months pregnant with the “Scarface” star’s fourth child. The pair have been romantically linked since April 2022 after being photographed leaving Felix Restaurant in Venice, California. In April of this year, Alfallah shared a photo of her with Pacino on her Instagram. The pair were at the Gagosian art gallery in New York City seeing her friend’s exhibition. Alfallah dated Mick Jagger from 2017 to 2018, according to E! Online. Pacino is also father to daughter Julie Marie, 33, whom he shares with ex-girlfriend Jan Tarrant. He also shares 22-year-old twins Anton and Olivia with ex Beverly D’Angelo. In an interview with The New Yorker in 2014, Pacino opened up about not wanting to be like his father, who left his family when he was 2. “Having children has helped a lot. I consciously knew that I didn’t want to be like my dad. I wanted to be there. I have three children. I’m responsible to them. I’m a part of their life,” he said, adding that when he’s not around them it’s “upsetting to me and to them.” “So that’s part of the gestalt And I get a lot from it. It takes you out of yourself,” he added. Pacino’s baby news comes the same month that his longtime friend and former co-star Robert De Niro also welcomed another child. The 79-year-old actor subtly revealed that he was now a father of seven while chatting with Entertainment Tonight Canada. “I just had a baby,” the “Taxi Driver” star said, without revealing more information. A rep for De Niro later confirmed the details to TODAY.com on May 9. That same day, De Niro spoke with “Access Hollywood” where he shared fatherhood tips. “Sometimes I don’t think people really know what being a good father is,” he said, quickly adding, “Well, they do. You know you have your responsibility.” “But look, it’s a mystery. It’s a lot of excitement, but scary. And you do your best,” he said.

U.S. Border Patrol chief retiring after seeing out end of Title 42 restrictions,Chantal Da Silva,"May 31, 2023, 9:09 AM UTC",Immigration,"The head of the U.S. Border Patrol is retiring after more than three decades with the agency and after having helped oversee policy changes this month to curb irregular crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border after the end of Title 42 pandemic restrictions. Troy Miller, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, called Chief Raul Ortiz a ""true leader"" in a statement announcing Ortiz’s retirement. ""He has numerous accolades and awards from his tenure in the Border Patrol, but the highest compliment we can bestow on him is that he is a great agent,"" Miller said. ""I want to congratulate Chief Ortiz on his retirement after more than three decades of service to our country. I look forward to seeing him out on the water, fishing from his boat, as he enters this next and well-deserved chapter.” It is not yet clear who will replace Ortiz, who said his last day would be June 30 in a note to staff members Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. “I leave at ease, knowing we have a tremendous uniformed and professional workforce, strong relationships with our union partners, and outstanding leaders who will continue to tirelessly advocate for you each day,” Ortiz said in the note, according to the AP. NBC News has not seen the note and was unable to immediately verify the reporting. The Border Patrol did not immediately respond to an overnight request for comment. Ortiz became the 25th chief of the Border Patrol on Aug. 15, 2021. His predecessor, Rodney Scott, who embraced restrictive immigration policies ushered in during the Trump administration, retired after the Biden administration asked him to step down. Ortiz led the Border Patrol through a large part of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Title 42 emergency health restrictions, which began in March 2020 during the Trump administration, allowing agents to swiftly turn migrants away from the U.S. border. Ortiz also helped roll out new restrictions this month to discourage migrants from crossing the border without authorization while opening up other legal pathways to enter the U.S. after the end of pandemic restrictions. Despite predictions of an influx of arrivals at the border after Title 42 ended May 11, the number of migrant encounters with U.S. border agents drop in the days after it expired. Shelter operators and workers have said that many migrants were aware they risked facing five-year bans from the U.S. if they were deported under an existing rule called Title 8, so, they said, many were waiting to get official U.S. asylum appointments via cellphone rather than trying to cross the border without authorization. In the lead-up to lifting pandemic restrictions, Ortiz estimated that 60,000 to 65,000 migrants were in northern Mexico waiting to enter the U.S. “We are not in a position where we can ATD everyone,” he said, referring to Alternatives to Detention, the program that allows the authorities to track migrants released into the country, but he said, “I would like to.” Ortiz began his career with the Border Patrol in May 1991 with the agency's San Diego Sector, according to a profile on the CBP's website. Before he joined the Border Patrol, he served in the Army’s 8th Infantry Division in Baumholder, Germany, and he attended the University of Texas at San Antonio and Southwest Texas Junior College, studying political science and criminal justice, the profile says. He was given two Meritorious Honor Awards from the State Department, the Certificate of Achievement from the state of Texas and the Superior Civilian Service Medal, the Defense Department’s third-highest civilian honor.

"Five juveniles arrested after brawl with Marines on California pier over Memorial Day weekend, officials say",Minyvonne Burke,"May 30, 2023, 4:29 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 4:23 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Five juveniles were arrested Tuesday in connection with an assault on three Marines on a Southern California pier over Memorial Day weekend. The suspects face felony charges of assault with a deadly weapon, the Orange County Sheriff's Department said in a news release. Four of the youths are boys and one is a girl, the sheriff's department said. The release did not identify what types of weapons were allegedly used but said they were not guns. Citing the ages of the suspects, the department declined to release additional information about their identities. The department said the fight, part of which was captured on cellphone video and shared on social media, broke out Friday night at San Clemente Pier, a popular seaside destination roughly 60 miles south of Los Angeles. Emergency personnel provided medical aid to two Marines who declined to be taken to a hospital, the department said. Investigators later found a third Marine who had been assaulted. ""Due to the nature of the incident and the large number of individuals involved, the investigation is ongoing,"" the department said. In the video, a male who appears to be a teenager punches a man in the back of the head. The man turns around and charges at the teen. During the scuffle, several other people surround and hit the man. People shout ""get his a--"" and ""get that f-----."" The fight is eventually broken up after a man and woman intervene. The video does not show what happened before the fight. The sheriff's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Hunter Antonino told KCAL-TV of Los Angeles that he was one of the Marines involved in the altercation. He said he was with two of his friends enjoying time off at the pier when around 30 teenagers showed up at the beach and started lighting fireworks, according to the station. When the debris hit him in the face, he politely asked the teens to leave, KCAL reported. ""They were lighting off fireworks, they were being belligerent, they were being obnoxious and annoying other people, so I went up to them and told them to stop,"" he said. Antonino said that the group followed him and two other Marines to the pier and that that was when a fight broke out. He said that he was beaten up and stomped on and that he believes he suffered a concussion, KCAL reported. Antonino could not be reached at phone numbers listed for him. "
5 people unaccounted for in partially collapsed Iowa apartment complex; 2 believed to still be in building,Marlene Lenthang,"May 30, 2023, 5:12 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 3:47 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Five people were unaccounted for after a historic Iowa apartment building partly collapsed, and officials said Tuesday that two of them are thought to be inside the building. Nine people have been rescued since the catastrophic structural failure of the 116-year-old, six-story complex in Davenport about 5 p.m. Sunday. City officials said at a news conference Tuesday that they plan to search the complex again. In the afternoon, a team searched part of the building ""that presented as acceptable risk"" for entry and rescued animals but found no people. ""Crews continued to search for human activity and none was detected,"" the city said on Facebook late Tuesday afternoon. The decision to search was an about-face a day after Davenport officials said they would demolish the structure Tuesday morning after K-9 units found no survivors inside. Hours after the announcement Monday, Lisa Brooks, 52, was rescued from her fourth-story apartment. Davenport Fire Marshal James Morris said the rescue was a “viable indication” that the city needed to look again for more survivors. Protesters had decried the demolition plans. Some carried signs that said “Davenport Deserves Better” and “Find Them First” as people chanted “Search and rescue!” Branden Colvin Jr., 18, whose father Branden Colvin is missing, said Tuesday that he’s frustrated. “It's been a new story every hour,” he said, adding, ""I just want to know where my dad's at."" Davenport Police Chief Jeffery Bladel said Tuesday that five people were unaccounted for and that “we have a firm belief” that two of them were “still potentially in that building.” One of those still believed to be inside is Ryan Hitchcock. Amy Anderson, his cousin, said at the news conference that she supported the demolition plans. “Ryan wouldn’t want anyone else to put their lives at risk,” she said. “I don’t discount that he could be trapped down there. … We don’t want to see any more families lose their lives or anybody else be injured in trying to remove that rubble.” She said she spoke with city officials Monday night and was promised that crews would search through the rubble to uncover any possible remains. Morris said that the city's goal is to search for additional occupants in the structure but that the building’s integrity had only worsened since the collapse and that it “shifted” when crews were onsite. “We are partnering with other entities, as well as our department, to respectfully remove any possible human remains with dignity,” he said. The demolition plans are ""under evaluation"" and essentially on hold. Officials haven't shared a timeline for when another search or demolition will take place. The cause of the collapse remains under investigation. Morris said that investigators are consulting with state agencies about who will take the lead in the investigation and that it hasn’t been determined whether a criminal offense has occurred. Officials also shed more light Tuesday on the property owner, identified as Andrew Wold, and past work at the site. Mayor Mike Matson said Wold was at the location Sunday and has been in contact with the city. Wold hasn’t replied to multiple requests for comment. Morris said that there were initial issues with the building and that a structural engineer’s report that was provided to the city determined it was safe. The report was completed by the engineering firm Select Structural Engineering, based in Bettendorf, Rick Oswald, the director of Davenport’s Development & Neighborhood Services, said Tuesday. He said two engineering reports were submitted within six months: at the end of January and last week. Both reports were in response to bricks’ falling off the building of 324 Main St., and both times the engineering firm reported to the city that the building was structurally sound and outlined repairs. Davenport's government said Tuesday afternoon: ""The stability of the building continues to degrade. ""The recovery of any unaccounted for individuals remains the priority of the City as operational planning progresses,"" it said in a statement. "

Third person charged in 2002 killing of hip-hop pioneer Jam Master Jay,Tim Stelloh,"May 31, 2023, 2:12 AM UTC",U.S. news,"A third person has been indicted in the killing of Run-DMC DJ Jam Master Jay, more than two decades after he was found fatally shot in his New York studio and nearly three years after two men were charged in the crime, officials said Tuesday. Jay Bryant, 49, was charged with the murder of Jam Master Jay, whose real name was Jason Mizell, while engaged in narcotics trafficking, according to a superseding indictment filed in federal court in New York's Eastern District. Bryant, who also faces a firearms charge, is being held on unrelated federal drug charges and is expected to be arraigned later, a spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said. In a detention memo, the prosecutor's office said Bryant was observed entering the DJ's Queens recording studio immediately before the shooting on Oct. 20, 2002. A piece of clothing left at the scene contained his DNA, according to the memo. Bryant allegedly claimed to an associate that he was the gunman who shot Mizell, but the memo cast doubt on the claim and said evidence to be presented at a coming trial would show that another person charged in the killing, Karl Jordan Jr., fired twice from close range. One of the shots struck an unidentified person in the leg, the memo says. After Mizell was hit in the head, Bryant, Jordan and a third person, Ronald Washington, fled, the memo says. Washington, who was accused of pointing a gun at someone inside the studio and ordering the person to lie on the floor, was indicted on the same charges as Bryant. Jordan was charged with those crimes and others, including multiple counts of cocaine distribution. In the detention memo, prosecutors argued that Bryant should remain behind bars while awaiting trial because he's a flight risk and poses a danger to the community. The memo points to previous drug charges, apparent multiple aliases and a statement Bryant is said to have made to authorities suggesting that he would flee to Cuba if he were released. A lawyer for Bryant said Tuesday that he had just learned of the charges. “Mr. Bryant will be pleading not guilty,” attorney Cesar de Castro said in an email. ""Securing an indictment in a secret grand jury, applying an extremely low burden of proof, is one thing. Proving it at trial is another matter.” Jordan and Washington pleaded not guilty. In a sworn statement, Washington previously said Mizell was a “childhood friend,” and he described the detectives investigating the case as hostile. A lawyer for Washington on Tuesday called Bryant's indictment a ""game changer"" and said his claims undercut the prosecution's case. ""What were they gonna do if this case went to trial in Feb…as scheduled?"" the lawyer, Susan Kellman, said in an email. A lawyer for Jordan did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday night. "
3 young children die in hot cars across the U.S.,Dennis Romero,"May 31, 2023, 12:59 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Three young children died in recent days after they were found unattended in vehicles in Washington state, Texas and Florida, authorities said. The fatalities boosted the number of hot-car deaths for children this year to six, double the number at this time last year, according to Jan Null, a California meteorologist who tracks the incidents. Police in Puyallup, Washington, a city just southeast of Tacoma, were investigating the death of a 1-year-old who was left in a vehicle parked at a hospital while the child's foster mother worked, they said Tuesday. The woman discovered the child in the car about 5 p.m. last Wednesday after roughly nine hours, Puyallup Police Capt. Don Bourbon said. She immediately took the child to the hospital, but the child died, he said. NBC affiliate KING of Seattle reported the vehicle was parked at MultiCare Good Samaritan Hospital in Puyallup. Police have suggested it was a mistake, with the foster mother distracted enough that morning to forget the child was with her, Bourbon told KING. “It’s horrifying not only for the family but anyone who’s involved in a child’s death,” Bourbon told NBC News. National Weather Service meteorologist Samantha Borth said high temperatures in the region were in the low 70s last Wednesday. Researchers concluded years ago that even a 70-degree day could result in deadly triple-digit temperatures inside a car as it acts like a greenhouse. In Houston, where temperatures reached the high 80s over Memorial Day weekend, police said they were investigating the death of a 4-year-old boy who was found in an unlocked parked car with a 2-year-old girl about 4:30 p.m. Friday, according to a statement. Both were rushed to a hospital, where the 4-year-old was pronounced dead, police said. The 2-year-old was expected to recover, it said. An adult found the children, who had been playing outside their home, in the vehicle with at least one of the children reported to be unconscious, police said. In Palm Bay, a city on Florida's Atlantic coast, an 11-month-old was discovered unresponsive early Sunday afternoon after having spent three hours unsupervised in a parked vehicle, city police said in a statement Tuesday. The parents had been attending church services, the police department said. The incident was under investigation, it said. ""This is an unfortunate incident,"" Chief Mario Augello said in a statement from the department, ""and our condolences and prayers go out to the family."" High temperatures in the area Sunday were at or near 80, according to National Weather Service data. The U.S. Climate Prediction Center has said there's a greater likelihood, compared to equal chances, that warmer-than-normal temperatures will be experienced in much of the country through the end of August. Those areas include the locations of the late-May deaths: the Pacific Northwest, Texas and Florida. Hot-car deaths by heatstroke are the leading cause of non-crash vehicle deaths for children under 14, according to the U.S. Transportation Department. Children who die in hot cars usually do so because rapidly rising temperatures cause heatstroke. A vehicle’s temperature can spike 40 degrees in an hour, according to a Stanford study co-authored by Null, who tracks hot-car deaths on his website NoHeatStroke.org. Likewise, children’s core temperatures rise fast — three to five times faster than adults’ — with heatstroke settling in with a body temperature of 104 and death at 107, according to a fact sheet distributed by the Transportation Department. The organization Kids and Car Safety calls this time of year, from late May to summer's end, ""hot car death season"" and says the transition to a new season can bring households new routines that can distract and disorient parents. ""A change in the normal daily routine and fatigue are the most common contributing factors for a child being unknowingly left behind in a vehicle,"" the organization said in a statement Tuesday. The Transportation Department says the number of child hot car deaths went down in recent years as a result of the pandemic's impact on the number of people working from home. In 2020 and 2021, the annual numbers for child deaths in hot cars — 25 and 23, respectively — were each less than half the figure for 2019: 53. In total, 33 such deaths were reported last year, according to NoHeatStrokeDeath.org. The numbers are not encouraging, because at this time last year, three deaths had been reported, Null said. It's a sign the nation is returning to post-pandemic normalcy, he said. The best preventive measure, experts say, is to develop routines that always take children into account, even if they're out of school, overseas or at a grandparent's house. Null recommends placing a teddy bear on the front passenger seat when children are in the back. And he said drivers should place items such as briefcases and bag lunches in the back seat so they'll have to look there when they arrive at work. "
"Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten should be paroled, appeals court rules",The Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 11:54 PM UTC",U.S. news,"LOS ANGELES — A California appeals court said Tuesday that Leslie Van Houten, who participated in two killings at the direction of cult leader Charles Manson in 1969, should be let out of prison on parole. The appellate court’s ruling reverses an earlier decision by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who rejected parole for Van Houten in 2020. She has been recommended for parole five times since 2016. All of those recommendations were rejected by either Newsom or former Gov. Jerry Brown. Newsom could request that California Attorney General Rob Bonta petition the California Supreme Court to stop her release. Bonta’s office referred requests for comment to Newsom’s office, which didn’t respond to questions about possible next steps. Van Houten, now in her 70s, is serving a life sentence for helping Manson and other followers kill Leno LaBianca, a grocer in Los Angeles, and his wife Rosemary. Van Houten was 19 at the time. Newsom has said that Van Houten still poses a danger to society. In rejecting her parole, he said she offered an inconsistent and inadequate explanation for her involvement with Manson at the time of the killings. The Second District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles ruled 2-1 to reverse Newsom’s decision, writing there is “no evidence to support the Governor’s conclusions” about Van Houten’s fitness for parole. The judges took issue with Newsom’s claim that Van Houten did not adequately explain how she fell under Manson’s influence. At her parole hearings, she discussed at length how her parents’ divorce, her drug and alcohol abuse, and a forced illegal abortion led her down a path that left her vulnerable to him. They also argued against Newsom’s suggestion that her past violent acts were a cause for future concern were she to be released. “Van Houten has shown extraordinary rehabilitative efforts, insight, remorse, realistic parole plans, support from family and friends, favorable institutional reports, and, at the time of the Governor’s decision, had received four successive grants of parole,” the judges wrote. “Although the Governor states Van Houten’s historical factors ‘remain salient,’ he identifies nothing in the record indicating Van Houten has not successfully addressed those factors through many years of therapy, substance abuse programming, and other efforts.” The dissenting judge argued that there was some evidence Van Houten lacked insight into the heinous killings, and agreed with Newsom that her petition to be released should be denied. Nancy Tetreault, Van Houten’s attorney, said she expects Newsom to request that Bonta ask the state Supreme Court to review the lower court’s decision, a process that could take years. In addition, Bonta will likely request a stay of the appellate court’s ruling, Tetreault said. The high court could order Van Houten’s release while it decides on whether to grant the stay. “I will, of course, vigorously oppose any stay,” Tetreault said. “And they could let her out during that process.” Van Houten was 19 when she and other cult members stabbed to death the LaBiancas in August 1969. She said they carved up Leno LaBianca’s body and smeared the couple’s blood on the walls. The slayings came the day after other Manson followers, not including Van Houten, killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others in violence that spread fear across Los Angeles and captivated the nation. Van Houten was found suitable for parole after a July 2020 hearing, but her release was blocked by Newsom. She filed an appeal with a trial court, which rejected it. She then sought her release through the appellate courts. "
New York fertility doctor accused of using own sperm dies when hand-built plane crashes,The Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 11:44 PM UTC",U.S. news,"YATES, N.Y.  — A New York fertility doctor who was accused of using his own sperm to impregnate several patients died over the weekend when the hand-built airplane he was in fell apart mid-flight and crashed, authorities said. Dr. Morris Wortman, 72, of Rochester, was a passenger in the experimental aircraft that went down Sunday in a pasture in Orleans County. The pilot, Earl Luce Jr., of Brockport, also was killed, according to the county sheriff. The crash of the aircraft, identified by the National Transportation Safety Board as a Wittman W-5 Buttercup airplane, remained under investigation Tuesday. Preliminary findings indicate that “the wings of the aircraft became detached from the fuselage and fell to the ground in an orchard,” Sheriff Christopher Bourke said in a news release Monday. The fuselage continued west for another 1,000 to 1,500 yards before crashing. Wortman was a well-known OB-GYN in western New York who was often the target of anti-abortion protesters. He was sued in 2021 by the daughter of one of his patients, who became pregnant in the 1980s. The lawsuit said the doctor secretly used his own sperm while telling the patient the donor had been a local medical student. It said the doctor kept the secret even after the daughter, his biological offspring, became his gynecology patient. The daughter discovered that Wortman was the donor after DNA genealogy tests revealed she had at least nine half-siblings, her medical malpractice suit said. The civil lawsuit, which is pending in Monroe County Court, said follow-up DNA testing with Wortman’s daughter from his first marriage confirmed the genetic link. Wortman did not comment at the time the lawsuit was filed. "
"Scottie Pippen says Michael Jordan was 'horrible to play with' on Chicago Bulls, more focused on scoring over winning",David K. Li,"May 30, 2023, 9:27 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Michael Jordan was a ""horrible player"" who was ""horrible to play with,"" Scottie Pippen, the top wingman for His Airness on the Chicago Bulls, said recently. Pippen — a consensus top NBA player of all time in his own right — has long been a critic of Jordan, but he threw more fuel on the fire in an interview on last week's episode of the ""Gimme the Hot Sauce"" podcast with former teammate Stacey King. ""Our game is a team game, and one player can't do it,"" Pippen said. “I’ve seen Michael Jordan play before I came to play with the Bulls. You guys have seen him play. He was a horrible player. He was horrible to play with. It was all 1-on-1, shooting bad shots. And all of a sudden, we become a team and we start winning. Everybody forgot who he was."" While Jordan is known for his fierce competitive nature, Pippen said the young Jordan's passion was for scoring, not winning. ""He was a player that, really, winning wasn't at the top of his category,"" Pippen said. ""It was scoring. He was going after scoring titles.” A representative for Jordan couldn't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Fans seemed to take Jordan's side. Pippen credited Bulls coach Phil Jackson with bringing the team together to win all those titles. But in the interview, he also threw shade on the Jackson, often portrayed as a ""Zen master,"" for not harnessing his own ego. ""I just don't know if he was ever in my corner,"" Pippen said. ""He just really turned sour to me his last couple of years of coaching, not that that took anything away from me as a player or how I played the game. He became selfish. It really was the breakup of our [team], to be honest. One selfish guy on the team, another selfish guy coaching the team. It was time for a divorce."" Asked whether he could ever repair his relationships with Jordan and Jackson, Pippen bluntly said no. ""Stacey, you've been around Michael. You've been around Phil.  Their egos are huge, and I don't bow down to people like that,"" Pippen said. The debate about the NBA's all-time greatest player tends to break down to Jordan vs. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James. Pippen declined to take sides but didn't mind offering his take on the five greatest players he has seen: Jordan, James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and Karl Malone. But he again returned to his team-first mantra, saying: ""There is not a greatest player."" ""LeBron James is probably one of the greatest winners that ever played the game. He wins,"" Pippen said. ""Now does that make him the greatest player to ever play the game? No. ""Michael Jordan probably is one of the greatest individual scorers that we've ever seen, but probably not. It's probably Kareem. It's hard for me to say who's the greatest player to ever play in the game."" "
Man arrested in the death of New Jersey council member shot and killed in her car,Doha Madani,"May 30, 2023, 9:11 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A man has been arrested in the death of a New Jersey borough council member who was shot in her car in February, officials said Tuesday. Rashid Ali Bynum, 28, was arrested in Chesapeake, Virginia, in the death of Eunice Dwumfour, Middlesex County Prosecutor Yolanda Ciccone said at a news conference Tuesday. Dwumfour, 30, was shot multiple times in her car Feb. 1 in Sayreville, where she was a member of the Borough Council. Bynum was charged with first-degree murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a handgun and second-degree possession of a handgun for unlawful purpose, Ciccone said. He was arrested Tuesday morning and awaits extradition to New Jersey. It’s unclear whether he has an attorney. A presumed motive wasn’t given; it appears the two may have known each other. “A search of the victim’s phones revealed Bynum as a contact in Eunice Dwumfour’s phone with the acronym FCF,” Ciccone said. “FCF is believed to be an acronym for the Fire Congress Fellowship, a church the victim was previously affiliated with.” Ciccone said that Bynum fit the witness description at the time of Dwumfour's death and that phone device records showed he was traveling from Virginia to New Jersey only to immediately return after Dwumfour’s death. The device records allegedly matched the travel time of what appears to be a rented Hyundai Elantra that license plate readers recorded in toll areas. A witness told police about having seen a suspicious white Hyundai in the area at the time of Dwumfour’s death, Ciccone said. Search records also showed Bynum was looking up Dwumfour’s current search, the area of Sayreville and magazines compatible with a specific handgun, Ciccone said. Ciccone didn't take questions Tuesday afternoon. Dwumfour sustained ""multiple gunshot wounds"" and died at the scene, police have said. Mahesh Chitnis, who served on Sayreville’s Human Relations Commission with Dwumfour, said in a tribute post that Dwumfour was shot about 300 feet from his home. “I am shocked, scared and heartbroken,” the post said. “She was a woman full of life."" Dwumfour was a Republican serving a term from 2022 to 2024, the council's website said previously. Former Sayreville Police Chief John Zebrowski was selected to fill Dwumfour's seat, according to the news site MyCentralJersey.com. Dwumfour's family and area residents had expressed frustration with the lack of results in the investigation, according to NBC New York. Sayreville Mayor Victoria Kilpatrick even announced that she would not seek re-election because of threats she had been getting over the case. “I’m calling this my pause,"" Kilpatrick said in April. ""I have to pause because there’s nothing more important than my children and than my family."" New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin acknowledged the discontent at Tuesday’s news conference, saying the community has raised ""a lot of questions."" ""I want you to know that the folks behind me and the folks in this community and across the state that work tirelessly on this investigation did so to ensure public safety and to ensure that those questions could be answered,"" Platkin said. ""And I hope that today is the beginning of a healing process and also the beginning of a sense of justice for you."" "
11-year-old says being shot by Mississippi officer felt like 'a big punch to the chest',Minyvonne Burke,"May 30, 2023, 7:42 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Aderrien Murry, the 11-year-old boy who was shot by a Mississippi police officer after he called for help, said the moment he was struck by the bullet felt like ""a big punch to the chest."" Aderrien was seriously injured when he was shot in the chest May 20 by an Indianola police officer responding to a domestic call at his mother's home. ""I ran across the corner, and then I just got shot,"" he said in an interview Tuesday with ABC News, demonstrating how he exited the room with both hands raised in the air. He said getting shot felt like ""a Taser, like a big punch to the chest."" Police were called to the home after the father of another child of Nakala Murry, Aderrien's mother, unexpectedly showed up around 4 a.m., according to a $5 million federal civil rights lawsuit the family filed Tuesday. The man was ""irate,"" the suit says, and Murry told Aderrien to call the police. Officer Greg Capers arrived ""with his firearm drawn at the front and asked everyone inside of the residence to come outside,"" it says. Carlos Moore, an attorney for the family, said police were told that the man was unarmed and had run out a back door and that three children were in the residence. As Aderrien was coming around the corner of a hallway that led into the living room area, ""he was instantly shot by Defendant Officer Capers,"" according to the suit. The child suffered a collapsed lung, a lacerated liver and fractured ribs, it says. Murry told ABC News that after he was shot, her son said, ""I don't want to die."" ""I said: 'You not gonna die, baby. You not gonna die. Just keep talking,'"" she said. Aderrien was taken to the hospital and released four days later to recover at home. He said he has had trouble breathing, ABC News reported. The lawsuit accuses Capers of failing to assess the situation before he displayed and fired his weapon. It names the city of Indianola, Police Chief Ronald Sampson and Capers as defendants. No charges have been filed, and Capers remains on paid administrative leave. There have been calls for him to be fired and charged. The police department and Capers declined to comment Tuesday, citing the investigation. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said it is investigating. "
Her wife vanished as they started to flee their crumbling Iowa building,Maggie Vespa,"May 30, 2023, 5:00 AM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 7:39 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The 116-year-old building had its issues, tenants have long said, but as the fresh cracks Lexus Berry had spotted Saturday grew the next day, she decided it was time to go. She and her wife, Quanishia White-Berry, grabbed their animals and headed out. “I heard these crackling sounds, and we’re like, ‘Something is wrong. We need to leave,’” Berry, 27, said. “She picked up the kitten; I picked up the cat.” She and White-Berry were just a few steps from getting away from their fourth-floor apartment in Davenport, Iowa, when part of the building violently surrendered to gravity and took much of their home with it. ""I went to open up the door and blinked, and everything just caved in on us,"" Berry said. Her wife's face was replaced by a cloud of dust, she said, as White-Berry descended into the rubble. ""Just seeing a bunch of just black dust, wood,"" Berry said. ""And then it was just white, just like that. And it was one of those moments where I was like, did I just die? Because how bright it was. But it was the sun beaming."" Part of the six-story building, which was completed in 1907 as a hotel, collapsed about 5 p.m. Sunday, officials said. Firefighters initially rescued seven people before they pulled the eighth, White-Berry, from the location early Monday, authorities said. White-Berry, 24, was carefully plucked from the pile of bricks as concerns that the rest of the structure could come down dogged first responders, authorities said. Another dozen or so people were escorted from the building, Davenport Fire Chief Mike Carlsten said. White-Berry suffered multiple injuries and was taken to a hospital, where she remained in critical condition late Monday, Berry said. She was conscious the whole time she was trapped, with her upper body unhindered but her legs pinned in rubble, Berry said. Berry wasn't entirely sure how she didn't suffer the same fate. ""Where I was standing [was] just a plank of laminate floor,"" she said, ""enough for me to stand on. I looked around and everything around me was gone."" A woman identified as Lisa Brooks, 52, was rescued from an upper floor Monday night after, family members said, she hid under a couch for more than 24 hours. She was rescued after city officials said the historic, six-story building would be demolished as early as Tuesday morning and the search-and-rescue operation had shifted to a recovery effort late Monday morning. After Brooks' rescue, Mayor Mike Matson said the decision to tear the remaining parts of the structure down would be re-evaluated. "
"Coast Guard suspends search after charter boat sinks off Alaska, leaving 1 dead and 4 missing",Chantal Da Silva,"May 30, 2023, 9:12 AM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 7:28 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The Coast Guard has suspended its search for survivors after a charter boat sank off Alaska on Sunday, leaving one person dead and four others missing. The search began after the Coast Guard at Sector Juneau received a call Sunday night from Kingfisher Charters alerting them that a 30-foot charter vessel with five people on board had not arrived at its destination, the agency said in a news release. The vessel had last been seen underway Sunday afternoon, it said. Search crews found one person dead Sunday night before locating the boat, which was partially submerged off Low Island, about 10 miles west of Sitka, the agency said. They continued to search for the four missing people Monday but suspended the operation at sunset, the Coast Guard said. The people who were on the boat have not been publicly identified. Kingfisher Charters did not immediately respond to an overnight request for comment. Air and vessel rescue teams searched 825 square miles over the course of more than 20 hours, the Coast Guard said. A number of good Samaritan boats also helped with the search. “Despite our best efforts and those of several partner agencies, we were not able to find the four remaining individuals,"" said Darwin Jensen, Captain of the Port Southeast Alaska.

"Natalee Holloway case suspect Joran van der Sloot injured in Peruvian prison brawl, lawyer says",Nicole Acevedo,"May 30, 2023, 5:52 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The Dutch man who was among the last to see Natalee Holloway before she vanished was injured in a prison brawl as he awaits extradition to the United States, his Peruvian lawyer said Tuesday. Joran van der Sloot found himself in the middle of a fight between rival gangs Saturday inside Challapalca Prison, where he's serving a 28-year murder sentence, defense attorney Maximo Altez told NBC News. While van der Sloot is being treated in the facility's medical wing, Altez said, his client's injuries are ""nothing too serious."" The attorney said he's instructed his client to oppose extradition to the United States, ""but he decided against it” and seeks to come to America to fight charges related to the Holloway case. Van der Sloot’s case in Alabama dates back to 2010 when he was charged with two federal counts of extortion and wire fraud. Prosecutors claim he was sent thousands of dollars by Holloway’s family on false promises that he’d reveal the location of the missing woman’s remains and other details of her death. While there's been no date set yet for van der Sloot's travel to Alabama, Altez said only a few bureaucratic issues remain, such as his client passing a physical exam and for government officials to make travel arrangements. “The only thing left to resolve are administrative issues,” Altez said in Spanish. Representatives for federal prosecutors in Alabama and his U.S. defense lawyers could not be immediately reached for comment  Tuesday. In the early morning hours of May 30, 2005, Holloway and others in her traveling party left a nightclub in Aruba, witnesses said. Her friends went back to their hotel, but Holloway, then 18, got into a gray or silver Honda with three young men — van der Sloot, then 17, and Surinamese brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe, local police have said. Holloway hasn't been seen since and has been declared legally dead. Although he's never been prosecuted in Holloway's death, van der Sloot has long been on the radar of law enforcement and the Alabama woman's family. In early 2012, he pleaded guilty to killing business student Stephany Flores, 21, in his hotel room in Lima, Peru, on May 30, 2010. He reportedly attacked Flores after she looked at his laptop computer and determined he was connected to Holloway’s disappearance. "
LGBTQ activists call for new strategies to promote equality after Target backlash,Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 4:41 PM UTC",OUT News,"Following Target’s announcement last week that it removed products and relocated Pride displays to the back of certain stores in the South, activists in the LGBTQ community are calling for new campaigns to convince corporate leaders not to cave to anti-LGBTQ groups. “We need a strategy on how to deal with corporations that are experiencing enormous pressure to throw LGBTQ people under the bus,” said California state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, a member of the LGBTQ legislative caucus. “We need to send a clear message to corporate America that if you’re our ally — if you are truly our ally — you need to be our ally, not just when it’s easy but also when it’s hard,” he said. While the retailer said its actions were aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of its employees after protesters knocked over Pride signs and confronted workers in stores, the controversy comes at a time when conflict over LGBTQ rights is simmering. Nearly 500 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in state legislatures around the country this year. At least 18 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors. The hostile environment has prompted some groups to hire security consultants to advise them on activities planned for Pride Month, which begins on Thursday. “We are forced to think differently about how we handle security at our events and whether or not we can post our staff’s names and emails on our website,” said Janson Wu, executive director of GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, a nonprofit legal rights organization based in Boston. Debra Porta, executive director of Pride Northwest, in Portland, Oregon, said there have been discussions about a possible boycott, a letter-writing campaign and other actions directed at Target, but plans for an organized protest haven’t yet materialized. “Because the news is fairly new, more actions may be announced, especially as Pride Month gets here,” said Porta. Target isn’t the only company grappling with public criticism. Bud Light is still dealing with fallout from its partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who in April posted a picture on Instagram of a beer can with her face on it. In response to the hate-filled and transphobic backlash that followed, the company said it “never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people,” but didn’t directly address the rhetoric or signal clear support for Mulvaney. Bud Light’s parent company, Anheuser-Busch, is tripling its U.S. marketing spending In early May, several gay bars in Chicago stopped selling Anheuser-Busch products to protest the company’s response. Chicago’s 2Bears Tavern said the company’s response “shows how little Anheuser-Busch cares about the LGBTQIA+ community, and in particular transgender people, who have been under unrelenting attack in this country.” “Since Anheuser-Busch does not support us, we will not support it,” said the company. Sidetrack, the largest gay bar in the Midwest, did the same, saying Anheuser-Busch “wrongfully validates the position that it is acceptable to acquiesce to the demands of those who do not support the trans community and wish to erase LGBTQ+ visibility.” In Florida, Disney has been engaged in a legal battle with Gov. Ron DeSantis since the company expressed its opposition to the state’s classroom limits on discussing gender identity and sexual orientation. And the Los Angeles Dodgers announced last week that a satirical LGBTQ drag troupe called the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence will again be welcome at the team’s annual Pride Night — nearly a week after the team rescinded its original invitation, citing backlash from conservative Roman Catholics and politicians who accused the group of mocking the Christian faith. “Now’s not the time to back down,” said Brian K. Bond, executive director of PFLAG, an organization founded in 1973 to advocate for LGBTQ people and their families. “I think both business and us as citizens need to look within ourselves into new strategies. The old models aren’t necessarily working,” he said. Some people remain concerned about the impact of Target’s Pride displays on children, said Victoria Cobb, president of The Family Foundation of Virginia, a conservative, faith-based organization in Richmond. “Target is paying the price for telling kids to be discontent with their bodies, putting ideology ahead of the interests of investors, and creating a hostile store environment for parents with children,” Cobb said in a statement. In a Richmond Target store on Sunday, Pride merchandise was prominently displayed at the front of the store. Brenda Alston, a 75-year-old retiree, said she bought a pair of rainbow sandals to show support for the LGBTQ community and for Target. “If you come in the store and this is not what you support, keep on walking and get what you need in another part of the store,” Alston said. “Who are you to tell me what to buy and what Target should offer their customers?” Still, some see the hostility toward Target and other retailers as just the latest obstacle in a decades-long struggle for equality. “To me, this is a sign that we’re winning,” said Derek Mize, a gay attorney who lives in an Atlanta suburb with his husband and two children. “I think that these people moaning about our visibility are the last breaths of a dying prejudice,” he said. “Society is changing, and most people are not concerned about Target selling an LGBTQ shirt.” "
Woman rescued uninjured 24 hours after Iowa building's partial collapse,Maggie Vespa,"May 30, 2023, 4:27 AM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 4:37 PM UTC",U.S. news,"After a 52-year-old woman was pulled unscathed Monday evening from a partially collapsed Davenport, Iowa, apartment building, the city's mayor said a previously announced plan to quickly tear down the structure was ""under evaluation."" Lisa Brooks was rescued after more than 24 hours apparently hiding under a couch on an upper floor of the six-story structure, authorities and family members said. Relatives said she heard the destruction, felt the building's partial collapse Sunday and responded with fight-or-flight instincts: She dived under the furniture and stayed put. She appeared to be in an unaffected unit, and when her phone started working again, she called for help, family members said. A crowd of 100 or so onlookers welcomed her, even as some staged impromptu protests against the city's decision to tear the 116-year-old building down as soon as Tuesday morning. The rush, including a transition from search-and-rescue to recovery, is relatively unusual. In a collapse at a condominium complex, albeit a much larger building than the Davenport structure, in Surfside, Florida, in 2021, search-and-rescue efforts continued for two weeks. Ultimately, 96 people died. Brooks was the second person rescued from the building after seven people were initially pulled out after the collapse at 5 p.m. Sunday, authorities said, bringing the number of rescued to nine. A woman trapped in the rubble was rescued Monday morning and hospitalized in critical condition, authorities and family members said. Her wife identified the patient as Quanishia White-Berry. An additional dozen or so residents had gotten out immediately with the help of first responders, Davenport Fire Chief Mike Carlsten said. At a news conference Monday morning, Carlsten said the operation would shift to recovery mode, and by late morning the city had announced the shift had taken place. ""Demolition is expected to commence in the morning,"" the city said. Recovery mode indicates a belief that no more survivors would be found. One factor is the apparent instability of the brick-over-steel and concrete building, which started life as the city's premier hotel in 1907 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At Monday's news conference, Carlsten said the condition of the parts of the building that remain standing pose a risk to anyone inside, including rescue crews. ""At this time the building is structurally unsound,"" he said. City officials planned a news conference at 10 a.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) Tuesday. CORRECTION (May 30, 2023, 12:36 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated when White-Berry was rescued. She was pulled out Monday morning, not evening.

It takes a support group, all of that,” Yarl’s mother, Cleo Nagbe, said ahead of the race, adding: “Let’s raise more awareness to stop the things that cause brain injuries and should not be causing them, especially gun violence.” As many as 1,000 people raced through the park, including many in neon green T-shirts who registered to be part of “Team Ralph,” said Robin Abramowitz, executive director of the Brain Injury Association of Kansas and Greater Kansas City. “It’s important for Ralph to see that he is not alone,” Yarl’s aunt, Faith Spoonmore, said. She added that Yarl has debilitating migraines and issues with balance. He is also struggling with his emotions, mood changes and the trauma of the shooting. Andrew Lester, an 84-year-old white man, is accused of shooting Yarl. The teen had confused Lester’s address with a home about a block away where he was supposed to pick up his siblings. The shooting drew worldwide attention and prompted rallies and protests in the Kansas City area, with critics saying Lester was given preferential treatment when police released him just two hours after he was arrested.

"9 people, including 3 children, injured in shooting near beach in Hollywood, Florida",The Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 10:25 AM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 1:53 PM UTC",Guns in America,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — Nine people were injured Monday evening when gunfire erupted along a beachside promenade in Hollywood, Florida, sending people frantically running for cover along the crowded beach on Memorial Day. Several of the wounded were taken to a children’s hospital, police spokesperson Deanna Bettineschi said. The nine people hurt included six adults and three children, according to Yanet Obarrio Sanchez, a spokesperson for Memorial Healthcare System. All of the victims were in stable condition, she said. Bettineschi said four young people between the ages of 1 and 17 were hit, along with five adults between 25 and 65. One was in surgery late Monday while the others were stable, she said. It was not immediately clear if the hospital was counting a 17-year-old as an adult. Bettineschi said the shooting happened shortly before 7 p.m. A fight broke out, at least one gun was pulled and shots were fired. At least one person was in custody, but police were looking for more suspects. Police Chief Chris O’Brien said thousands of people were in the area and dozens of police officers responded, including some who were nearby. “It’s unfortunate we have law-abiding citizens who come to our beaches and that gets interrupted by a group of criminals,” he said. The shooting happened on the Hollywood Oceanfront Broadwalk near a convenience store, a Ben & Jerry’s ice cream store and a Subway sandwich shop. Alvie Carlton Scott III said he was on the beach when he suddenly heard numerous gunshots. He said he hid behind a tree and then fled the area after a police officer told people to run. Jamie Ward, who was also on the broadwalk, said several young men were fighting in front of the stores when one pulled a gun and started shooting. Videos posted on Twitter on Monday evening showed emergency medical crews responding and providing aid to multiple injured people. Police said there would be a heavy presence of officers as the investigation continues. Officials also set up an area for family members to reunite. “Thank you to the good samaritans, paramedics, police and emergency room doctors and nurses for their immediate response to aid the victims of today’s shooting,” Hollywood Mayor Josh Levy said in a statement. Hollywood Beach is a popular beach destination about 11 miles south of Fort Lauderdale and 20 miles north of Miami. The beach was expected to see more visitors than usual because of the Memorial Day holiday. "
"At least 16 dead, dozens injured in shootings across the U.S. over Memorial Day weekend",Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 29, 2023, 4:12 PM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 1:51 PM UTC",Guns in America,"Shootings across the U.S. left at least 16 people dead and dozens more injured over Memorial Day weekend. The gun violence occurred at beaches, high schools and motorcycle rallies, among other locations, across at least eight states. The victims were teenagers to people in their 60s. The weekend concluded as it began — with gunfire. Nine people were injured in a shooting in the Hollywood Beach area of Hollywood, Florida, on Monday evening as people enjoying the holiday amassed along the Atlantic coast north of Miami, police said. Police said an altercation between two groups led to the violence, with all nine victims hospitalized in unknown condition and the possibility that children were among the injured. A person of interest was detained, and a suspect was sought, Hollywood police spokesperson Deanna Bettineschi said at a nighttime news conference. Among the first reports of gun violence over the holiday weekend happened Friday afternoon, when Telemundo Chicago cameras caught a confrontation between two groups of people on Chicago's North Avenue Beach, NBC Chicago reported. The altercation led to gunshots but no injuries. Although Friday's shooting resulted in no injuries, more than eight people were killed and at least 32 others were injured in Chicago shootings over the long weekend, according to NBC Chicago. Reports of shootings dotted the rest of the U.S., though the total number does not appear to be an outlier for a holiday weekend. The U.S. averages about 57 gun-related homicides per day, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. In Baltimore around 3:30 p.m. Friday, an argument between two men led to gunfire, which injured five people, officials confirmed to NBC News. The five  who were struck have not been publicly identified. The victims had non-life-threatening injuries, Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said. Police are searching for the gunman, NBC affiliate WBAL reported. In Mesa, Arizona, police took Iren Byers, 20, into custody in connection with multiple shootings from Friday afternoon to early Saturday, police said in a news release. Byers is accused of killing four people and injuring one person, police said. It was not immediately clear whether he had retained an attorney who could be asked for comment. The injured victim in Mesa, a 36-year-old woman, was stable and will undergo surgery for serious injuries, said Detective Brandi George, a Mesa police spokesperson. Byers was booked into jail on four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder, a news release said. He was being held without bail, the release said. On Saturday, police were called to Roxbury Lanes Casino in Seattle after they got reports that shots had been fired. Three people were injured, KOMO-TV reported; the severity of their injuries was not immediately clear. Police had yet to arrest a suspect Monday morning. In Red River, New Mexico, a suspect was arrested after three people were killed and five others were injured — including the suspect — at a motorcycle rally Saturday evening. Police identified the dead Sunday as Anthony Silva, 26, of Los Lunas; Randy Sanchez, 46, of Albuquerque; and Damian Breaux, 46, of Socorro. Police identified the suspect as Jacob David Castillo, 30, of Rio Rancho. Castillo was injured and hospitalized. He will be booked into the Taos County Detention Center upon his release, police said. Castillo could not be immediately reached for comment. Three people were injured, two of them seriously, in Garden Grove, California, in a shooting Saturday evening at Hot Restaurant and Lounge. Garden Grove Police Sgt. Nick Jensen said the gunman got into an argument before he opened fire, NBC Los Angeles reported. “There was some type of altercation, so it wasn’t someone that walked in off the street, and an altercation ensued, and the suspect pulled out a gun and shot three victims,” Jensen said. Patrons detained the man until officers arrived. Although the suspect was initially detained, it was not immediately clear whether he had been arrested and charged. Police have not publicly identified either the suspect or the victims. Early Sunday in Atlanta, a teenager was killed and another was injured in a shooting at ""an unauthorized gathering"" at Benjamin E. Mays High School, Atlanta Public Schools said in a statement. Police were called around 2:30 a.m. ET Sunday to the high school, where they discovered a 16-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy, both of whom had been shot. The girl died later. The boy was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was stable. Officials identified the deceased as Breasia Powell, NBC affiliate WXIA reported. The Fulton County medical examiner did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Later Sunday, around 11:45 a.m. ET, a person was killed in a shooting on a Green Line train at the Navy Yard station in Washington, D.C., Metro Transit Police tweeted. “Unfortunately, despite lifesaving measures, the adult male victim was pronounced deceased at the scene,” transit police said. The shooter and the victim got into a fight on the train, Assistant Washington Police Chief Andre Wright said. Wright said the victim sustained “multiple gunshot wounds” to his upper body.

Al Roker returns to 'TODAY' after total knee replacement surgery: ‘All good’,"Caroline Kee, TODAY","May 30, 2023, 1:49 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Al Roker is getting back to regularly scheduled programming. The beloved weatherman returned to ""TODAY"" on Tuesday, less than one month after his total knee replacement surgery. “I’ve got a new knee,” he told co-anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, adding that he feels “all good.” Roker, 68, underwent the procedure May 9 and has since taken time off to recover. Last week, he surprised his co-hosts by making a cameo on the Third Hour of TODAY. Tuesday marks his first day fully back in the studio after the surgery. While absent from the show, Roker kept fans in the loop by sharing updates about his recovery on social media and video calls to the ""TODAY"" show. On May 10, one day after his surgery, Roker posted a video of himself walking on his new knee down the hallway of New York City’s Hospital for Special Surgery. A total knee replacement involves replacing an injured or worn-out knee joint with an artificial implant, according to the Hospital for Special Surgery, to reduce or eliminate pain and improve mobility. Recovery time varies, but most people are able to walk without the help of a cane or walker about six weeks after surgery, according to the hospital. In a video call to ""TODAY"" on May 15, Roker updated fans on his progress and shared more details about his surgery. “Just been kind of hanging out,” he told his co-hosts. “Just chilling out, not doing anything, which I know a lot of people find hard to believe.” On the call, Roker clarified that he previously had knee replacement surgery on the same knee 23 years ago. “This one is a little more complicated because it was what they call a revision. It’s was a replacement of a replacement, so they had to take stuff out, put new stuff in, so it was a bit of a bear,” he said. “It’s stiff.” About 85% to 90% of people who have a total knee replacement will be able to use the knee implants for 15 to 20 years, according to the hospital, after which point some patients may need a second operation (or a revision) to fix or replace the implants. Roker's wife, Deborah Roberts, shared an update on Instagram on May 21, letting fans know that he was on the mend but not as quick to get back on his feet, as the revision was a “harder surgery.” “It’s a little bit harder to snap back from, but he’s doing pretty well, moving a little slowly,” she said, thanking his followers for their concern and interest in his well-being. On May 23, Roker shared an X-ray of his new knee during a video call to ""TODAY"" to update fans on his progress. “I’ve had a number of body replacements. It’s not a big surprise, (but) this one has been the toughest one yet because they had to take out the old one, which had some complications, and then put in a new one,” Roker told his co-hosts on the Third Hour of TODAY. Holding up a photo of the X-ray on his phone for viewers, Roker explained what went into his new knee. “There’s a hinge that goes all the way up into the femur down to the tibia and then there’s a hinge in between,” he said. “They really had to do a lot of work to get the old stuff out and the new hardware in. Plus, there’s a titanium cone in there for the bone to grow around.” He noted that he had been focusing on taking it easy and doing outpatient physical therapy at the hospital for his knee. On May 15, Roker said he would be doing three days of physical rehabilitation per week for “a few months” to get himself back up to speed. Roker has remained committed to walking, documenting his progress in the Start TODAY Facebook group, and reached some major exercise milestones in the past year. Last May, Roker walked the Brooklyn Half Marathon, and in August, he hit a 200-day streak of walking 10,000 steps. In March, Roker celebrated his “best day yet,” walking a record 13,600 steps in one day. Roker's total knee replacement is the latest step forward in his health journey. "
"Sam Bankman-Fried's bid to dismiss cryptocurrency charges is 'meritless,' prosecutors say",Reuters,"May 30, 2023, 12:13 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Prosecutors urged a Manhattan federal court judge on Monday to deny a request by FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried to dismiss criminal charges accusing him of stealing billions of dollars from customers to plug losses at his hedge fund. Bankman-Fried, the 31-year-old former cryptocurrency billionaire, has pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of fraud, conspiracy, making illegal campaign contributions and foreign bribery. On May 8, Bankman-Fried urged U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan to dismiss most of the counts, saying prosecutors charged him in a “rush to judgment” following a broad crash in 2022 where several prominent crypto companies went bankrupt, including his own Alameda Research. In a filing late Monday, prosecutors described motions to dismiss the charges as “meritless,"" rebutting Bankman-Fried’s argument that the indictment’s allegations were insufficient and legally defective. “The Indictment sufficiently alleges that the defendant and his co-conspirators made false and misleading representations to lenders relating to Alameda’s financial condition. No more specificity is required,” prosecutors wrote. Kaplan will hear oral arguments on June 15. Bankman-Fried has said FTX’s risk management was subpar, but has denied stealing funds. He has sought to distance himself from the collapse of Alameda, the crypto-focused hedge fund he owned. Its former chief executive, Caroline Ellison, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. He has also argued that some of the fraud charges he faces were based on a theory that the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated on May 11. The theory, known as “right to control,” centers around depriving a victim of economically valuable information rather than tangible property. The Supreme Court called the theory “inconsistent” with how federal fraud laws had been written and historically applied, when it overturned a bid-rigging conviction of a Buffalo, New York, construction executive, earlier this month. Legal experts have said Bankman-Fried faces long odds of getting the charges tossed, because prosecutors can point to tangible money that his customers lost. Bankman-Fried rode a boom in digital currency values to a $26 billion net worth, and became an influential political and philanthropic donor, before FTX sought Chapter 11 protection in November. Since his December extradition from the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried has largely been under house arrest at his parents’ Palo Alto, California, home on $250 million bond. His trial is scheduled for Oct. 2. CORRECTION (May 30, 2023, 9:45 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Sam Bankman-Fried’s role with FTX. He is one of two co-founders, not the sole founder. "
"Man who crashed U-Haul truck near White House wanted to end U.S. democracy, prosecutors say",Ken Dilanian,"May 30, 2023, 12:59 AM UTC",U.S. news,"The man accused of crashing a box truck into barriers near the White House in a bid to overthrow the government planned to give a speech announcing the end of U.S. democracy, prosecutors said. Sai Varshith Kandula, 19, of Chesterfield, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, was being held without bail pending a hearing Tuesday. He was arrested after the crash May 22 and charged with depredation of property of the United States. Investigators and prosecutors, however, have suggested that the weightier matter was his alleged intention to seize power and harm the president if necessary. A memo federal prosecutors filed Friday in support of keeping Kandula behind bars with no conditions before a potential trial said he kept a journal that included a coup speech he planned to give had he taken over the government after the crash. The memo quotes a passage of the journal, which the defendant described as a ""green book,"" that describes a post-democratic U.S. He addresses ""my fellow citizens of America"" in prescribing historic change. “As I am familiar with the [unknown] of this country being a democratic nation, and this will no longer be the case,"" the passage reads, according to the memo. ""There shall be consequence if civil unrest happens. To make it clear Any opposition will be met with death penalty to make it clear: (kill president) As you have seen, we will declare martial until the situation has been [unknown]. We will rebuild this world."" The defendant, who allegedly grabbed a Nazi flag from the cargo area of the rented U-Haul just before he was apprehended, ended the passage with the words ""Sieg hail,"" echoing but misspelling the Nazi motto that means ""hail victory."" No one was injured in the crash at 9:35 p.m. The Ford commercial truck struck bollards at an entrance to Lafayette Square, north of the White House grounds, prosecutors said. The motorist backed up and struck them again, and the truck apparently was disabled at that point, they said. Kandula told Secret Service agents he planned to seize power and would kill President Joe Biden if necessary. He praised Adolf Hitler as a ""strong leader,"" according to the memo. Included in the memo were photos of the bollards the vehicle struck. They protect a pathway that leads directly to the White House, which can be seen in the distance. Prosecutors argue that Kandula is a danger to the community and a flight risk because he has visited India multiple times. They said he is a lawful permanent U.S. resident subject to deportation if he is convicted. The government argued that the attack on federal grounds was planned out, including travel from the St. Louis area to Washington and the rental of the box truck. Kandula's defense had yet to file a response. It wasn't clear whether he has legal counsel. The federal public defender's office in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kandula claimed success after the crash, even as he was deprived of freedom, according to the memo. He told Secret Service agents he believed his writings would reach a wider audience, it said. ""Either way,"" prosecutors quoted him as saying, ""whether I got into the White House or not, my message was received."" Kandula was scheduled to appear in federal court in Washington at 3 p.m. Tuesday for a hearing on whether he should remain behind bars pending a potential trial. "
Memorial Day 'Manhattanhenge' to light up New York City streets,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 29, 2023, 7:15 PM UTC",Science News,"New Yorkers and tourists alike spending their Memorial Day in the Big Apple on Monday will be treated to a city-stopping spectacle: Manhattanhenge. Manhattanhenge, a portmanteau of ""Manhattan"" and ""Stonehenge,"" is a twice-a-year solar event when the sunset lines up directly with the city's grid, casting golden rays down city streets. Several of the stones in Stonehenge, the prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England, experience perfect alignment with the sun during the summer and winter solstices, which is why the event takes its name from the rock formation. A Manhattanhenge sunset can bring the borough to a standstill as city dwellers and visitors clamor for a glimpse — and maybe a snapshot — of the city bathed in golden light. This year's Manhattanhenge dates correspond with both Memorial Day and Major League Baseball's All-Star break, according to the American Museum of Natural History. ""For these two days, as the Sun sets on the grid, half the disk sits above and half below the horizon. My personal preference for photographs. But the day after also offers Manhattanhenge moments, but at sunset, you instead will find the entire ball of the Sun on the horizon,"" Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium, said on the museum's website. Those hoping to catch a glimpse of the half-sun Manhattanhenge can do so at 8:13 p.m. ET Monday and again on Thursday, July 13, at 8:21 p.m. ET. The full sun effect can be viewed at 8:12 p.m. ET Tuesday and again at 8:20 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 12. The museum recommends watching the event on the east-west thoroughfares of Manhattan's 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd or 57th streets. "
British prank TikToker who went viral for entering stranger's home is in custody,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 29, 2023, 6:07 PM UTC",World,"A British TikToker who has become notorious for extreme pranks was in custody accused of violating a court order barring him from posting videos of people without their consent, according to London’s Metropolitan Police. Bacari-Bronze O’Garro, 18, known as ""Mizzy"" on social media, was charged Friday with three counts of violating a criminal order, the Met confirmed in an email Monday. O'Garro pleaded not guilty in Thames Magistrates’ Court on Saturday, according to the Met and The Guardian. O'Garro could not be reached for comment Monday. O'Garro is one of several internet creators who have used pranks to amass sizable followings, some of whom push legal boundaries with ever more outlandish stunts. O'Garro's pranks have included stealing an elderly woman's dog (he returned it) and tampering with a railway train's controls. O'Garro was handed a criminal behavior order Wednesday for a video he made in which he entered a family's home without their consent on May 15, the Met said in a news release. The family was at home at the time, and O’Garro recorded the encounter and posted it to his TikTok account. At that hearing, O’Garro pleaded guilty to violating a community protection notice he was given in May 2022. Judge Charlotte Crangle issued a two-year criminal behavior order, which barred O'Garro from posting videos without the consent of those being recorded. She also barred him from Westfield Stratford City, a shopping center in Stratford, East London, and fined him £365. O'Garro allegedly violated the criminal behavior order the day after it was issued, leading to his arrest Friday. Prosecutors claim he twice violated his criminal behavior order by posting a video of people without their consent, The Guardian reported. A third violation stems from O'Garro's allegedly visiting Westfield Stratford City. A video of O'Garro being taken into custody showed him hugging friends before police led him away. His next court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday. “Some people have referred to these as ‘prank’ videos, but I hope that this outcome demonstrates just how seriously we have been taking this investigation and the understandable public alarm, since this footage began circulating online,” Detective Chief Superintendent James Conway of the Central East Command Unit said in a statement.

"Video captures shootout between North Carolina bus driver and passenger after argument over stop request, officials say",Chantal Da Silva,"May 29, 2023, 9:30 AM UTC",Guns in America,"Dramatic video shows a bus driver and a passenger opening fire on each other on a moving bus in Charlotte, North Carolina, this month after an argument that left both men seriously injured, transit authorities said. The shootout, which happened May 18 while others were on the bus, began when a passenger authorities identified as Omarri Tobias got up while the vehicle was moving and asked the driver to let him off between stops, Charlotte Area Transit System officials said. The driver, David Fullard, told Tobias he would have to wait until the next designated stop, and an ""argument ensued,"" Brent Cagle, the transit system's interim CEO, said at a news conference. In video of the altercation the agency released last week, the bus driver and the passenger appear to have an exchange before Tobias pulls out a gun and Fullard takes out a firearm right after. Bullets shatter a barrier between the driver and the passenger. It was not immediately clear from the video who fired first. The transit agency did not immediately respond to an overnight request for comment. Tobias and Fullard sustained life-threatening injuries but were stable and expected to make full recoveries, Cagle said. Tobias faces several charges, including assault with a deadly weapon, he said. It was not immediately clear whether Fullard would face any charges. RATP Dev, the third-party operator of the city’s buses, said it had ""parted ways"" with Fullard after he violated employee policy by carrying a firearm on the job, NBC affiliate WCNC of Charlotte reported. RATP Dev did not immediately respond to an overnight request for comment. Cagle said an investigation found Fullard did not use any of a number of alarm systems available to bus drivers, WCNC reported. He also said that it was standard procedure not to allow passengers off between bus stops but that drivers can make allowances if necessary. Ken Harris, an attorney for Fullard, told WCNC the bus driver had worked with the transit system for nearly 20 years. “Mr. Fullard is a long-term employee of the CATS bus system,” Harris said before RATP Dev announced that it had parted ways with Fullard. “He loves his job, and he wants to continue to be there, and we want to make sure we address any issues that could come up related to this incident.” Harris also said incidents of bus drivers' being injured and assaulted while doing their jobs have been a persistent issue in Charlotte. “You have these incidents that happen over and over again, where drivers are being assaulted, shot at, shot or killed,” Harris said last week. “It creates a situation where drivers fear that they won’t make it home."" In February 2022, an agency bus driver, Ethan Rivera, was shot in what authorities said was believed to be a road rage incident. He died from his injuries the next day, WCNC reported.

Remains of Medal of Honor recipient killed in the Korean War to be buried in Georgia after being identified 73 years later,The Associated Press,"May 29, 2023, 7:51 AM UTC",U.S. news,"SAVANNAH, Ga. — Soldiers of the 9th Infantry Regiment made a desperate retreat as North Korean troops closed in around them. A wounded, 18-year-old Army Pfc. Luther Herschel Story feared his injuries would slow down his company, so he stayed behind to cover their withdrawal. Story’s actions in the Korean War on Sept. 1, 1950, would ensure he was remembered. He was awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military honor, which is now displayed alongside his portrait at the National Infantry Museum, an hour’s drive from his hometown of Americus, Georgia. But Story was never seen alive again, and his resting place long remained a mystery. “In my family, we always believed that he would never be found,” said Judy Wade, Story’s niece and closest surviving relative. That changed in April when the U.S. military revealed lab tests had matched DNA from Wade and her late mother to bones of an unidentified American soldier recovered from Korea in October 1950. The remains belonged to Story, a case agent told Wade over the phone. After nearly 73 years, he was coming home. A Memorial Day burial with military honors was scheduled Monday at the Andersonville National Cemetery. A police escort with flashing lights escorted Story’s casket through the streets of nearby Americus on Wednesday after it arrived in Georgia. “I don’t have to worry about him anymore,” said Wade, who was born four years after her uncle went missing overseas. “I’m just glad he’s home.” Among those celebrating Story’s return was former President Jimmy Carter. When Story was a young boy, according to Wade, his family lived and worked in Plains on land owned by Carter’s father, James Earl Carter Sr. Jimmy Carter, 98, has been under hospice care at his home in Plains since February. Jill Stuckey, superintendent of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, said she shared the news about Story with Carter as soon as she heard it. “Oh, there was a big smile on his face,” Stuckey said. “He was very excited to know that a hero was coming home.” Story grew up about 150 miles south of Atlanta in Sumter County, where his father was a sharecropper. As a young boy, Story, who had a keen sense of humor and liked baseball, joined his parents and older siblings in the fields to help harvest cotton. The work was hard, and it didn’t pay much. “Momma talked about eating sweet potatoes three times a day,” said Wade, whose mother, Gwendolyn Story Chambliss, was Luther Story’s older sister. “She used to talk about how at night her fingers would be bleeding from picking cotton out of the bolls. Everybody in the family had to do it for them to exist.” The family eventually moved to Americus, the county’s largest city, where Story’s parents found better work. He enrolled in high school, but soon set his sights on joining the military in the years following World War II. In 1948, his mother agreed to sign papers allowing Story to enlist in the Army. She listed his birthdate as July 20, 1931. But Wade said she later obtained a copy of her uncle’s birth certificate that showed he was born in 1932 — which would have made him just 16 when he joined. Story left school during his sophomore year. In the summer of 1950 he deployed with Company A of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment to Korea around the time the war began. On Sept. 1, 1950, near the village of Agok on the Naktong River, Story’s unit came under attack by three divisions of North Korean troops that moved to surround the Americans and cut off their escape. Story seized a machine gun and fired on enemy soldiers crossing the river, killing or wounding about 100, according to his Medal of Honor citation. As his company commander ordered a retreat, Story rushed into a road and threw grenades into an approaching truck carrying North Korean troops and ammunition. Despite being wounded, he continued fighting. “Realizing that his wounds would hamper his comrades, he refused to retire to the next position but remained to cover the company’s withdrawal,” Story’s award citation said. “When last seen he was firing every weapon available and fighting off another hostile assault.” Story was presumed dead. He would have been 18 years old, according to the birth certificate Wade obtained. In 1951, his father received Story’s Medal of Honor at a Pentagon ceremony. Story was also posthumously promoted to corporal. About a month after Story went missing in Korea, the U.S. military recovered a body in the area where he was last seen fighting. The unidentified remains were buried with other unknown service members at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. According to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, more than 7,500 Americans who served in the Korean War remain missing or their remains have not been identified. That’s roughly 20% of the nearly 37,000 U.S. service members who died in the war. Remains of the unknown soldier recovered near Agok were disinterred in 2021 as part of a broader military effort to determine the identities of several hundred Americans who died in the war. Eventually scientists compared DNA from the bones with samples submitted by Wade and her mother before she died in 2017. They made a successful match. President Joe Biden announced the breakthrough April 26 in Washington, joined by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. “Today, we can return him to his family,” Biden said of Story, “and to his rest.” "
"Body of escaped inmate found floating in Ohio River in Kentucky, police say",Dennis Romero,"May 29, 2023, 1:51 AM UTC",U.S. news,"The nearly weeklong search for a murderer who escaped from an Ohio prison ended Sunday when authorities confirmed that a body found floating in a Kentucky river is most likely the killer's. ""Today I believe we have closure to our five-day manhunt,"" Sean McKinney, chief of police in Henderson, Kentucky, said at a news conference. Earlier Sunday, a boater reported a body in the Ohio River, which shares Kentucky's northern border with Indiana and Ohio, McKinney said. After it was recovered, preliminary investigation determined it was that of Bradley Gillespie, 50, who was last seen near the banks of the waterway, he said. An autopsy scheduled for Tuesday will provide the last word on the identity of the remains, he said. Gillespie had a limp, seen on security video from a retailer in Indiana, because he might have been injured during the escape, authorities said earlier. The convict was last seen inside the Allen-Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio, on Monday, authorities said. The next morning he and fellow inmate James Lee, 47, were determined to be missing after a prisoner count, they said. Investigators say the two hid in a dumpster as part of their escape. Henderson is about 350 miles southwest of Lima. Authorities said the pair had also been seen at a Home Depot in nearby Evansville, Indiana, and in the small city of Vincennes, Indiana, where they might have tried unsuccessfully to break into a vehicle. On Wednesday, police said, Gillespie and Lee are believed to have been inside an allegedly stolen vehicle that was chased by Henderson officers in the area until it crashed and the suspects fled. Lee was captured nearby, but Gillespie apparently fled and remained at large. After the vehicle pursuit, authorities swarmed the Henderson area with dozens of officers, three helicopters and bloodhounds. But on Sunday, McKinney suggested Gillespie may have drowned days ago, his body remaining at the bottom of the river until the weekend. ""The levels or stages of decomposition are consistent with a body that’s been in the water four to five days,"" McKinney said. Gillespie was convicted of two counts of murder and was serving two consecutive 15-to-life sentences following sentencing in 2016, Ohio authorities said. Lee had been convicted of burglary and other theft-related crimes, they said. Four corrections department employees were placed on paid administrative leave amid internal and Ohio State Highway Patrol investigations into the jailbreak. "
A teenager is dead and another is injured after shooting outside Atlanta high school,Mirna Alsharif,"May 28, 2023, 6:40 PM UTC / Updated May 28, 2023, 7:08 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A teenager was dead and another was injured after a shooting outside an Atlanta high school early Sunday, police said. No suspects were in custody. Police said the incident involved multiple high school-age students. Atlanta police responded to a report of multiple people shot at Benjamin E. Mays High School around 2:27 a.m. Two victims, a 16-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy, were found and taken to hospitals. The girl was pronounced dead, while the boy was stable, police said. The victims, who were rising juniors, have not been publicly identified. It is not clear whether they attended the school. Mayor Andre Dickens said at a news briefing Sunday afternoon that the dead victim had been ""full of life."" ""My heart goes out to both families, and definitely to the family of the decedent,"" he said. ""This young lady was full of life and was actually expected to be working for the city of Atlanta starting on Tuesday in our summer youth employment program."" Benjamin E. Mays High School is Dickens' alma mater. Atlanta Public Schools said in a statement that the gathering at the end of the high school's exiting driveway was unauthorized. Other children from different districts and counties were at the school, Dickens said. ""I'm asking parents across the metro area, I'm asking youth across the metro area, to please consider your safety, to please make sure your parents know where you are. And parents, know where your children are,"" Dickens said. ""And young people looking to gather after midnight and finding places to go, we want you to be safe and make conscious, quality decisions about where you go."" Schools Superintendent Lisa Herring said the shooting, which happened just days after the close of the school year, was ""tragic."" ""A crisis team will be on campus this coming Tuesday to help those who might need additional support,"" Herring said. ""Our condolences go out to our families that have been impacted."" Atlanta police continue to investigate and are offering a reward of $10,000 for information. "
One person arrested after New Mexico motorcycle rally shooting that killed 3 and injured at least 5,Dennis Romero,"May 28, 2023, 5:17 AM UTC / Updated May 28, 2023, 6:35 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Three people were killed and at least five others were injured — one of whom has been charged with murder — in a shooting Saturday at a popular motorcycle rally at a New Mexico resort town, officials said. The shooting broke out around 5 p.m. on Main Street in the town of Red River among members of outlaw motorcycle gangs, New Mexico State Police said Sunday.  The Justice Department defines the gangs as ""organizations whose members use their motorcycle clubs as conduits for criminal enterprises,"" including weapons and drug trafficking. Officers found two people dead at the scene, and six injured people were taken to hospitals, one of whom was airlifted to a Denver hospital, state police said. One of the injured who was taken to a local hospital was later pronounced dead, said police, who said all eight victims were members of the motorcycle gangs. State police on Sunday identified the dead as Anthony Silva, 26, of Los Lunas; Randy Sanchez, 46, of Albuquerque; and Damian Breaux, 46, of Socorro. One of the injured, Jacob David Castillo, 30, of Rio Rancho, was charged with an open count of murder, state police said. He was hospitalized and will be booked into the Taos County Detention Center upon his release, police said. Another injured person, Christopher Garcia, 41, of Texas, was charged with cocaine possession and booked into the detention center after his release from the hospital. Mathew Charles Jackson, 39, of Austin, Texas, was also booked into the detention center after he was charged with unlawful carrying of a firearm in a liquor establishment. It is unclear whether he was counted among the injured. Police said ""the remaining four individuals"" who were injured have not been charged. That would bring the total injured to at least six; police said earlier that there were only five surviving injured victims. A state police spokesperson could not be reached by phone or through multiple emails to explain the discrepancy. The extent of the injures was not immediately available. There are more than 300 active outlaw motorcycle gangs across the country, according to the Justice Department, which says five of the gangs — the Hells Angels, the Mongols, the Bandidos, the Outlaws and the Sons of Silence — ""pose a serious national domestic threat"" and conduct most of the criminal activity, including international drug smuggling. It was not immediately clear which gangs were alleged to be involved in Saturday's shooting. Police said earlier that the scene was secure and that there was ""no ongoing threat to public safety."" The Phoenix field division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the federal agency is assisting state police in the investigation. Red River, a resort town of 675 northeast of Taos in a range at the southern end of the Rocky Mountains, was expecting nearly 30,000 people over the weekend as part of the 41st annual Red River Memorial Motorcycle Rally. Events connected to the rally include music performances, according to a website for the event. Mayor Linda Calhoun said on the town’s Facebook page that the crime scene included most of Main Street. State and local law enforcement agencies recommended that only essential businesses outside the investigation area stay open and requested that others remain closed Sunday, she said. Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina tweeted that he is originally from Red River, which is about 170 miles northeast of Albuquerque, and that he was having dinner with his wife in the town at the time of the shooting. ""Prayers for all impacted by todays shooting in my hometown,"" Medina tweeted. ""What a helpless feeling not having a badge, gun or radio as State Police officers and others enter the restaurant and slowly everything closes down and you don’t even know if you can get to your car or if it’s in the scene,"" he added. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she was in contact with Calhoun and law enforcement. “My thoughts are with the Red River community following this violent incident,” she tweeted. In a joint statement, U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján and Reps. Teresa Leger Fernández, Melanie Stansbury and Gabe Vasquez said they are ""heartsick,"" saying the shooting ""desecrated a decades-old, cherished community gathering."" They called for greater action to prevent gun violence, noting that the shooting came less than two weeks after an 18-year-old gunman fatally shot three elderly women and wounded two police officers in Farmington, a city 230 miles west of Red River. ""We cannot let these events become normal,"" they said. ""We must do more to prevent gun violence.” "
"Arizona mother pleads guilty to murder, child abuse after 6-year-old son died of starvation",The Associated Press,"May 28, 2023, 4:39 PM UTC",U.S. news,"FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — An Arizona mother has pleaded guilty to murder and child abuse charges stemming from the death of her 6-year-old son who had been locked in a closet and denied food. Elizabeth Archibeque reached a plea agreement with prosecutors this month, the Arizona Daily Sun reported Saturday. Archibeque will be sentenced later this summer. The terms of the plea agreement state that she will not be eligible for probation, and if sentenced to life in prison, she will not be eligible for any kind of parole or work release. She was charged along with the boy’s father, Anthony Martinez, and grandmother, Ann Martinez. The cases were being tried separately. An autopsy found the boy, Deshaun Martinez, died of starvation in March 2020. Authorities had said he weighed just 18 pounds — well below average for his age. The boy’s parents initially attributed their son’s malnourished state to a medical condition and to ingesting diet or caffeine pills. Eventually, they told police they kept Deshaun and his older brother in a closet for 16 hours a day and gave them little to eat. The brother survived. Police said the boys’ confinement was punishment for stealing food while the parents slept. "
Man pleads not guilty to human smuggling in case at U.S.-Canada border near where 4 died,Dennis Romero,"May 28, 2023, 3:14 AM UTC",U.S. news,"A Florida man who was arrested last year near the U.S.-Canada border with two migrants in a rented passenger van pleaded not guilty Friday to federal human smuggling charges. U.S. Border Patrol arrested Steve Anthony Shand, 48, of Deltona, the morning of Jan. 19, 2022, near the border, about 7 miles northeast of St. Vincent, Minnesota, officials said. He was indicted on two counts of human smuggling — one for each person in the van — the U.S. attorney’s office for Minnesota said. Shand pleaded not guilty Friday in a Zoom conference with U.S. Magistrate Judge Leo I. Brisbois. He has not been charged in connection with the deaths of the four migrants or with the discovery, as detailed in charging documents, of several other migrants in the area. His attorney, who was present during Friday's videoconference, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening. Hours after Shand was arrested last year, Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the bodies of four people believed to be migrants from western India had been found nearby, about 40 feet from the border in Canada, authorities said in a criminal complaint filed in the case. Authorities later identified the dead as Jagdish Patel, 39; Vaishaliben Patel, 37; and their children, Vihangi, 11, and Dharmik, 3. They had become separated from a larger group of migrants crossing the border in blizzardlike conditions and freezing temperatures, U.S. and Canadian officials said. Five Indian migrants who had split off from the family were discovered alive that day a quarter-mile south of the border heading toward where Shand was arrested, the complaint said. One of the five survivors said he was carrying a backpack for the family that died, the complaint said. Two other migrants also found in the area were hospitalized, and one faced amputation of a hand after frostbite set in, the complaint said. Like many other migrants, the Patels may have faced crushing economic conditions in India and calculated that the trek to the U.S., which had included a flight to Toronto, was worth the risk, friends and relatives have said. Shand was arrested in a rural area between ports of entry at Lancaster, Minnesota, and Pembina, North Dakota. He was held for five days before he was released on a judge’s order that included multiple conditions, including that he not travel beyond Minnesota or Florida. After he was arrested, Shand invoked his right to remain silent, prosecutors said. Shand is a naturalized citizen from Jamaica who rented the 15-passenger van from an agency at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport two days before his arrest, the document said. The van, which contained plastic cups, water jugs, snacks and juice bottles, was scheduled to be returned the next day, the complaint said. Some of the migrants had winter clothing that appeared new and similar to items in Shand's possession, the complaint said. Five of the seven surviving migrants from that day wore the same model of boots, and similar shoe prints were spotted along the border the previous week, officials said in the complaint. The split-off group of five started their crossing just on the Canadian side. They traveled less than a mile but had been walking for more than 11 hours in zero-degree weather when they were discovered in the U.S., according to the filing. One of the five told authorities they expected to be picked up on the U.S. side. "
"Texas House votes to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton, triggering suspension",The Associated Press,"May 27, 2023, 4:38 PM UTC / Updated May 28, 2023, 12:01 AM UTC",Politics News,"AUSTIN — Texas’ Republican-led House of Representatives impeached state Attorney General Ken Paxton on Saturday on articles including bribery and abuse of public trust, a sudden, historic rebuke of a GOP official who rose to be a star of the conservative legal movement despite years of scandal and alleged crimes. Impeachment triggers Paxton’s immediate suspension from office pending the outcome of a trial in the state Senate and empowers Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to appoint someone else as Texas’ top lawyer in the interim. The 121-23 vote constitutes an abrupt downfall for one of the GOP’s most prominent legal combatants, who in 2020 asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn President Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of Donald Trump. It makes Paxton only the third sitting official in Texas’ nearly 200-year history to have been impeached. Paxton, 60, decried the move moments after scores of his fellow partisans voted for impeachment, and his office pointed to internal reports that found no wrongdoing. “The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,” Paxton said. “It was a politically motivated sham from the beginning.” Paxton has been under FBI investigation for years over accusations that he used his office to help a donor and was separately indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015, though he has yet to stand trial. His party had long taken a muted stance on the allegations — but that changed this week as 60 of the House’s 85 Republicans, including Speaker Dade Phelan, voted to impeach. “No one person should be above the law, least not the top law officer of the state of Texas,” Rep. David Spiller, a Republican member of the committee that investigated Paxton, said in opening statements. Another Republican committee member, Rep. Charlie Geren, said without elaborating that Paxton had called some lawmakers before the vote and threatened them with political “consequences.” Lawmakers allied with Paxton tried to discredit the investigation by noting that hired investigators, not panel members, interviewed witnesses. They also said several of the investigators had voted in Democratic primaries, tainting the impeachment, and that they had too little time to review evidence. “I perceive it could be political weaponization,” Rep. Tony Tinderholt, one of the House’s most conservative members, said before the vote. Republican Rep. John Smithee compared the proceeding to “a Saturday mob out for an afternoon lynching.” Paxton has been under FBI investigation for years over accusations that he used his office to help a donor and was separately indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015, though he has yet to stand trial.

Tony Tinderholt, one of the House’s most conservative members, said before the vote. Republican Rep. John Smithee compared the proceeding to “a Saturday mob out for an afternoon lynching.” Paxton is automatically suspended from office pending the Senate trial. Final removal would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate, where Paxton’s wife’s, Angela, is a member. Representatives of the governor, who lauded Paxton while swearing him in for a third term in January, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on a temporary replacement. Before the vote Saturday, Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz came to Paxton’s defense, with the senator calling the impeachment process “a travesty” and saying the attorney general’s legal troubles should be left to the courts. “Free Ken Paxton,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social, warning that if House Republicans proceeded with impeachment, “I will fight you.” In one sense, Paxton’s political peril arrived with dizzying speed: The House committee’s investigation came to light Tuesday, and by Thursday lawmakers issued 20 articles of impeachment. But to Paxton’s detractors, the rebuke was years overdue. In 2014, he admitted to violating Texas securities law, and a year later he was indicted on securities fraud charges in his hometown near Dallas, accused of defrauding investors in a tech startup. He pleaded not guilty to two felony counts carrying a potential sentence of five to 99 years. He opened a legal defense fund and accepted $100,000 from an executive whose company was under investigation by Paxton’s office for Medicaid fraud. An additional $50,000 was donated by an Arizona retiree whose son Paxton later hired to a high-ranking job but was soon fired after displaying child pornography in a meeting. In 2020, Paxton intervened in a Colorado mountain community where a Texas donor and college classmate faced removal from his lakeside home under coronavirus orders. But what ultimately unleashed the impeachment push was Paxton’s relationship with Austin real estate developer Nate Paul. In 2020, eight top aides told the FBI they were concerned Paxton was misusing his office to help Paul over the developer’s unproven claims that an elaborate conspiracy to steal $200 million of his properties was afoot. The FBI searched Paul’s home in 2019, but he has not been charged and denies wrongdoing. Paxton also told staff members he had an affair with a woman who, it later emerged, worked for Paul. The impeachment accuses Paxton of attempting to interfere in foreclosure lawsuits and issuing legal opinions to benefit Paul. Its bribery charges allege that Paul employed the woman with whom Paxton had an affair in exchange for legal help and that he paid for expensive renovations to the attorney general’s home. A senior lawyer for Paxton’s office, Chris Hilton, said Friday that the attorney general paid for all repairs and renovations. Other charges, including lying to investigators, date back to Paxton’s still-pending securities fraud indictment. Four of the aides who reported Paxton to the FBI later sued under Texas’ whistleblower law, and in February he agreed to settle the case for $3.3 million. The House committee said it was Paxton seeking legislative approval for the payout that sparked their probe. “But for Paxton’s own request for a taxpayer-funded settlement over his wrongful conduct, Paxton would not be facing impeachment,” the panel said.

U.S. Coast Guard ends search for Louisiana teen who went overboard in the Bahamas,Mirna Alsharif,"May 27, 2023, 6:50 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The U.S. Coast Guard has ended their search for a Louisiana teenager who went overboard during a sunset cruise in the Bahamas on Wednesday night. The agency announced the conclusion of its search for 18-year-old Cameron Robbins, a recent high school graduate, on Saturday after a two-day effort led by the Royal Bahamas Defence Force. The agency did not clarify if a body was found. Robbins was in the Bahamas staying at the Atlantis Paradise resort in Nassau with other teenagers from Baton Rouge to mark their high school graduations, Louisiana State University confirmed Thursday. Robbins graduated from the University Lab High School, which operates as part of LSU, on Sunday. The trip was not a school sanctioned event, according to LSU. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force contacted the Coast Guard for assistance on Wednesday at 11:30 p.m. after Robbins fell off the Blackbeard's Revenge sunset cruise ship, according to a news release. ""U.S. Coast Guard District Seven deployed multiple search and rescue assets in response to an agency assistance request from our partners in the Royal Bahamas Defence Force,"" said Lt. Commander Matthew Spado, Coast Guard liaison officer to the Bahamas. ""Our Coast Guard command center and aircrews based in Miami supported RBDF search and rescue efforts since the initial report Wednesday evening, and continued through Friday evening."" Search and rescue crews searched more than 325 square miles looking for Robbins.

Rabies fears prompt baby raccoon to be euthanized after woman takes it to Maine Petco for nail trimming,Mirna Alsharif,"May 27, 2023, 3:31 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A baby raccoon was euthanized after an unidentified woman took it for a nail trimming service last week to a Petco store in Maine where the animal was handled and even kissed by other people. The incident prompted fears that many had been exposed to rabies, because raccoons are one of the most common carriers of the virus in Maine, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife said Thursday on Facebook. The animal tested negative for the deadly virus, which required it to be euthanized under Maine's rabies testing guidelines. The woman walked into the Petco on Mount Auburn Avenue in Auburn on Tuesday afternoon with the raccoon and requested nail trimming services. The wildlife agency shared pictures of the woman, whom it is still looking for. ""It is illegal to possess wildlife in Maine, and Petco does not trim raccoon nails,"" the wildlife department said in a news release. Many people handled the animal while they waited for service, and some kissed it. Raccoons are common carriers of rabies, which can be spread to humans if their saliva or neural tissue comes into contact with a bite, a scratch or a cut or gets in the mouth, the nose or the eyes. The virus can be lethal unless it is treated. ""Once the store manager was alerted to the raccoon, the manager asked the woman with the racoon to leave the store, and contacted the Maine CDC and the Maine Warden Service,"" the agency said. The agency confirmed in an update that the animal tested negative for rabies and that those who came into contact with it did not need treatment. Under Maine's testing guidelines, ""animals submitted for testing must be euthanized."" The wildlife department asks anyone with information about the woman to come forward. The agency is also reminding residents that it is illegal to possess wildlife in Maine and that they should never try to handle, feed or move a wild animal. “If you care, leave them there,"" the agency said.

Culture wars are making it harder than ever for the small number of Latino professors,Raul A. Reyes,"May 27, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",Latino,"Some Latinos in academia are assessing the impact of the increasing attacks on and measures against diversity initiatives amid low numbers of tenured Latino professors and a difficult career path. This past semester, Maria Chávez didn’t think her assignment for her Latino politics course was controversial. Chávez asked her students to write an op-ed on an issue facing the Latino community. As the class wrapped up, one extra copy of the assignment was accidentally left behind. The next day, Chávez found the spare copy of the homework defaced with rants about “illegal aliens” and “Stop teaching victimization!” The paper was unsigned. “These are the kinds of actions that people are emboldened to do now,” said Chávez, professor of political science at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. “The racialization and stigmatization that Latinos experience in the U.S. are often replicated in the classroom.” Chávez is part of the relatively small group of Latinos in the academic world. Achieving academic tenure, professors say, is a difficult and challenging process. Now, they're also grappling with how to navigate the increased politicization of education as states like Florida limit diversity initiatives and place controls on educational content and courses, particularly those on race and ethnicity. “The direct attack on the knowledge about the experiences about people of color is something that is very antidemocratic, and it is very personally harmful to students in a way that impacts who they are as people, as academics, and as future academics,” Chávez said. “The political debates about so-called wokeness and critical race theory are just an attempt to silence people of color and our experiences,” Chávez said. “When academics of color start using theories to understand the experiences that marginalized communities have, it’s construed as illegitimate, that it shouldn’t be taught.” Chávez said she would not “in good conscience” advise her Latino students to pursue a career in academia in the social sciences. “You have to constantly balance your personal and professional identity.” To Chávez, it's a treacherous time to be teaching American history and politics. “There is this backlash against diversity, and my undergrad students are aware of it; there is backlash against any kind of anti-racist education, and that makes it hard for everybody.” The increasing politicization of education comes amid significant underrepresentation of Latinos in college faculty. While a record number of Latinos are attending four-year colleges — accounting for 1 in 5 college students — nearly three-quarters of postsecondary faculty members were white in 2020, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Latinos comprise only 6% of faculty members at colleges and universities. Among full-time professors, Latino representation is lower — at just 4%. Amid these low numbers, university faculty are increasingly facing scrutiny from conservatives and Republicans in several states denouncing “wokeness,” a term broadly defined as being sensitive to racial and social injustice, and critical race theory, a legal theory that explores how racism is embedded in American institutions. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who launched his presidential campaign Wednesday, recently signed legislation  limiting teaching on structural racism, curtailing diversity, equity and inclusion programs and limiting protections for tenured faculty at state colleges and universities. The Texas House recently passed a bill to eliminate DEI programs and offices at state colleges and universities. Irma Montelongo, director of Chicano studies at the University of Texas at El Paso, finds political meddling in education “pretty sinister.” Politicians “are concerned that we are teaching subjects that encourage ethnic communities to hate white communities? That couldn’t be further from the truth,” Montelongo said. “We teach our students to love their communities, to love themselves, to see themselves in history, in stories and in literature. We’re not teaching our students to hate anybody.” Montelongo called attempts to curtail ethnic studies “a total whitewashing of American history.” When she teaches Mexican American history, Montelongo said her students are “enthralled — because they have never been exposed to this kind of knowledge.” Her students begin to see themselves in history and make connections with their own family stories. “They become super interested in the material, and then wonder, why weren’t we ever taught this before?” With GOP lawmakers aiming to restructure some aspects of public education in Texas, Montelongo said she and her colleagues are watching such developments closely. “We are paying attention, but no one is freaking out; we have to see how things play out.” So far, she has not seen any measure that would lead her, for example, to change her course offerings. Nor does she envision any drastic restructuring of the tenure system because doing so could “destroy” universities as research-intensive campuses. Most full-time college professor positions require a Ph.D., a process that can take about 8 years; some positions allow a master's degree, which takes about 6 years.  Because of this time commitment, many young Latinos, especially from working-class backgrounds, face familial pressure to begin working as soon as possible. “Sometimes, your family may not understand why you want to bother getting a Ph.D.,” said Louis Mendoza, a professor of Latino literary and cultural studies at Arizona State University. “They tell you to just be a teacher.” “It’s like you are setting yourself up for a big challenge with both your known community,” Mendoza said, “and the community you are hoping to enter.” Mendoza said Latino professors can face isolation, particularly if they are pursuing a subject matter that is unfamiliar to non-Latino faculty evaluating their work. “But being an agent of change in higher ed, and for my peers, is important to me.” This lack of Latinos in academia reflects a pipeline problem, according to Patrick L. Valdez, board chair of the American Association of Hispanics in Higher Education. “As we look at the figures for educational attainment, the higher we go, the numbers of Latinos become smaller ... so the funnel just needs to be bigger.” Valdez, a visiting professor at the University of Kentucky, believes that institutions should make more efforts to recruit and retain Latino academics. “Colleges need to ask themselves about the makeup of the search committee, whether they are looking for potential faculty members in nontraditional places, and if they have a strategy to find Latino Ph.D. candidates.” When colleges have an awareness of being “equity-minded,” Valdez explained, then they will be better positioned to attract Latino faculty. Last June, 20 top research universities committed to doubling the number of Latino doctoral students at their schools by 2030 by boosting the number of research opportunities and projects, and they pledged to increase the number of Latino professors by 20%. Antonio Flores, president and CEO of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, emphasized the need to start fostering Latinos in academia in the early school years. ""We have to create more opportunities and pathways for success beginning as early as high school, or community college, to identify promising Latinos who might consider an academic career,"" he said. This kind of support can be critical, as many Latinos are the first in their families to graduate college and may not have family and friends to advise them on potential career paths. Even when Latinos attain their career goals in academia, some scholars of color, especially women, often face questions about their credentials and often are evaluated more poorly than white male professors, according to studies. In 2019, Lorgia García-Peña, a renowned ethnic studies scholar, was denied tenure by Harvard University, generating national outrage. Although the school later released a report from a tenure committee that found the system to be “structurally sound,” by then García-Peña had left Harvard for a position at Tufts University. Last year, García-Peña detailed her experiences at Harvard in a book. In an interview with NBC News last August, she said that “the more open conversations we have about what is wrong with academia, the more people can come into these career positions with their eyes wide open and knowing what to expect.” Amid the steep path for professors and the increased measures curtailing areas of study and diversity initiatives, UTEP's Montelongo emphasized that she never loses faith in her career path. “Many of our students come from groups that have been historically left out of higher ed, and now they are succeeding,” she said. “They are opening doors for their communities that were once shut. To see the pride in their parents’ eyes when they graduate, it’s indescribable.” “Our students are hungry to learn, not just Chicano studies, but history, creative writing and engineering,” Montelongo added. “To see them growing and developing, I know we are shaping El Paso’s future, and that they will be making the world a better place than it is today.” At Pacific Lutheran University, Chávez noted that despite the current political and educational climate, she's optimistic about the future for Latinos in academia. “Our numbers may be very small, but we are at the table. I have students who have fought to get to a university, but they are making it though. We are part of the conversation now.” "
Indiana funeral director pleads guilty to theft after 31 decomposing bodies were found at a funeral home,Tim Stelloh,"May 27, 2023, 3:44 AM UTC",U.S. news,"An Indiana funeral director pleaded guilty Friday to dozens of counts of felony theft after 31 decomposing bodies and 17 cremains were found at his funeral home last year, court records show. Randy Lankford, owner of Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center in Jeffersonville, will pay $46,000 in restitution to 53 families and faces a proposed sentence of 12 years — four years in prison and eight years of home incarceration, The Associated Press reported. Lankford pleaded guilty to 43 counts of theft where the value of the property is between $750 and $50,000, court records in Clark County show. He had been charged with 86 counts of theft and one count of corrupt business influence, according to the records. The theft charge was for failing to complete the funeral services he was paid for, according to the AP. Lankford will remain in custody under home incarceration until a sentencing hearing on June 23, according to the records. He still faces multiple lawsuits from people whose loved ones were among the bodies or cremains found at his funeral home last July. Police in Jeffersonville made the discovery after the local coroner’s office alerted the department to “conditions” at the funeral home on July 1, according to a petition from the Indiana Attorney General seeking to suspend Lankford’s license. Authorities found that three of the facility’s four air conditioners weren’t working, according to the petition. Bodies in body bags were stored in different rooms, the petition states, and several had been there for an “extended” period of time. The bodies were in various stages of decomposition, the attorney general's office said. In a civil complaint filed last week, a couple said Lankford sent them a plastic box last June purporting to contain their daughter’s remains. The couple later learned that their daughter hadn’t been cremated at all — she was among the decomposing bodies discovered at Lankford’s business. The suit accuses Lankford of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract. A message left on a number listed for Lankford was not immediately returned Friday night. Lankford’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "
Videos and 911 calls capture the frantic response to a deadly New Mexico rampage,Associated Press,"May 27, 2023, 3:41 AM UTC",Guns in America,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Hundreds of frantic calls poured in to dispatchers about a barrage of gunfire and bloodied victims along a busy street during this month’s deadly shooting in Farmington, prompting authorities to rush to the chaotic scene not knowing what was in store. Breathless with guns drawn, officers rushed toward the gunman. More shots popped off, and an officer yelled, “Subject down! Cease fire, cease fire!” Another officer who had been shot in the leg was put in a patrol car and taken to a nearby hospital. The minutes that followed were a scramble as authorities searched the neighborhood for a possible second shooter, while other officers huddled to figure out how far the crime scene stretched and which vehicles had been hit by gunfire. Hours of police body and dash camera videos released Friday along with hundreds of dispatch recordings paint a vivid picture of the May 15 shooting that rocked the northwestern New Mexico community. Three women were killed and six other people were injured — all at the hands of a lone 18-year-old gunman who was killed by officers. The 911 calls convey the widening chaos as residents called in the location of bullet-pocked vehicles, including an abandoned car with a door flung open and shattered windshield. Others helped a woman struck by flying glass inside her car. “A lady is in the car. And it looks like there was a bullet that went through the windshield and she’s bleeding bad,” one caller told an emergency dispatcher. As officers gathered on a street corner, they tried to make sense of what they were hearing from dispatchers and witnesses and take stock of their colleagues and the victims who had been taken to the hospital. One asked if it was a traffic stop that went bad. “No, just shots fired,” Detective Christopher Stanton replied. “People started calling in, ’Hey, we’re getting multiple shots down here — 30, 40 rounds, and then they just started pouring in.” He talked about a woman believed to be the first victim. A bullet broke through her windshield as she drove down a street lined by homes and churches. Shards flew and there was more gunfire, and she pulled down a side street not knowing where it was coming from. Meanwhile dispatchers were juggling 911 calls in rapid succession, coaxing details from rattled callers with quavering voices. “There’s a lady here, she’s bleeding right now,” one caller said to a dispatcher, who provided first aid instructions. Another call came from inside a home: “We heard screaming and crying,” the woman said. In another 911 audio recording, labeled “Suspects Mother,” a woman said her son had been suffering from depression and worried he might be involved in the shooting. The woman’s identity could not be immediately confirmed. “I’m just concerned. I have a son that’s been very, very depressed and I’m driving over and just wondering if you could give me any information. You know, he might be just fine. He’s just been really depressed and I was really concerned.” Authorities have said the shooter, Beau Wilson, 18, discharged more than 190 rounds during the rampage, most of them from the home he shared with his father. Video released Friday showed officers entering the suspect’s home to clear it, guns drawn, shouting, “Farmington police!” Family photos lined a wall near the front door, with a framed cross in the middle. Spent casings littered the front porch, where authorities said the gunman had walked outside that morning and indiscriminately started shooting at passing vehicles. Left dead were Farmington residents Gwendolyn Dean Schofield, 97, her 73-year-old daughter, Melody Ivie, and 79-year-old Shirley Voita, police said. The audio recordings included an anguished call from a daughter of Ivie after word reached her in Salt Lake City that her mother and grandmother were killed. “They were shot and killed this morning, potentially on their way to pick up my nephew from school, and I don’t know if there’s anything at all that you might be able to tell me,” Julianne Hamblin said. Audio conversations also indicated the large scale of the police response, including the coordination of an aircraft to possibly bring in more police. Some off-duty officers were called in, and others cut short calls across town to rush to the scene. “There’s a guy walking that has black pants and a black shirt on and a gun, and he’s just randomly shooting. ... He’s walking down Dustin (Avenue),” a woman said in another 911 call. “Can you see what type of gun it is?” the dispatcher asked. The gunman had a rifle and two handguns, authorities later confirmed. The videos showed officers canvassing the neighborhood, talking with residents and asking if they were OK. Others put up crime scene tape and marked the location of evidence. Two officers were posted near the gunman’s body to ensure the scene wasn’t disturbed. One seemed stunned at how young the suspect was, saying he appeared to be the same age as his son. “Crazy,” he said. “Crazy.” ___ Associated Press journalists Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, and Rio Yamat and Ty O’Neil in Las Vegas, Nevada, contributed to this report.

Man convicted of murder in California campground shootings that left father dead inside tent,Tim Stelloh,"May 27, 2023, 1:24 AM UTC",U.S. news,"A man accused of a string of shootings in and around a Southern California campground, including the killing of a pharmaceutical scientist as he slept with his two children inside a tent, was convicted Friday of second-degree murder and other crimes, his lawyer said. Anthony Rauda, 46, had been charged with first-degree murder in the June 22, 2018, killing of Tristan Beaudette, but the jury convicted him of the lesser count, attorney Nick Okorocha said in an interview. Rauda was also convicted of three counts of attempted murder and five counts of burglary, Okorocha said. The jury acquitted Rauda of seven counts of attempted murder in the series of shootings that spanned nearly two years, from Nov 3. 2016 to June 22, 2018, in and around Malibu Creek State Park, about 34 miles west of Los Angeles, he said. Beaudette, 35, was fatally shot. His daughters, then ages 2 and 4, were uninjured. The two children are among those named as victims in the second-degree attempted murder charges that Rauda was convicted of, Okorocha said. Rauda was also convicted of first-degree attempted murder in the shooting of a Tesla that was being driven near the park, Okorocha said. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In court, the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case said the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that Rauda fired at unsuspecting drivers and ""had a pattern of stalking and preying on campers"" at the park, usually between 3 and 5 a.m. City News Service reported. The first shooting allegedly targeted a man sleeping in a hammock. Rauda was acquitted of the crime. Rauda was arrested in October 2018 for the burglaries, which targeted a community center and water district facility in the area, City News Service reported. Food was taken during the break-ins. He was later indicted in the shootings. Okorocha said there were enough gaps in the case that jurors found reasonable doubt in the prosecutor's claims. “The jury appears to have been very careful and detail oriented in their deliberations,” he said.

Inmates escaped from Ohio prison in dumpster,Phil Helsel,"May 26, 2023, 11:47 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Two inmates who escaped from an Ohio prison this week did so by concealing themselves in a dumpster, the state department of corrections said Friday as a search for one of the men continued. Bradley Gillespie, 50, who was convicted of two counts of murder and was sentenced to two consecutive 15-to-life sentences in 2016, remained on the loose Friday, and officials in Kentucky were mounting a manhunt. The other inmate, James Lee, 47, who escaped from the Allen-Oakwood Correctional Institution has been captured, officials have said. The two men escaped from the prison in Lima, around 80 miles northwest of Columbus “after concealing themselves in a dumpster,” the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said in a statement Friday. They were discovered missing during a prisoner count at 11 a.m. Tuesday, the department has said. Officials then determined the men were last seen on surveillance video inside the facility just after 8:40 a.m. Monday, it said. Lee was captured by police in Henderson, Kentucky, on Wednesday after police chased a stolen car that officials believe also contained Gillespie. The car crashed, they fled on foot and Lee was arrested but Gillespie is believed to have evaded police, authorities have said. The search continued in Henderson, a city of around 27,000 on the banks of the Ohio River across the border from Indiana, police there said Friday. ""We’ve been going around the clock,"" Henderson Police Chief Sean McKinney said Friday. The search has involved forward-looking infrared, or FLIR, devices on helicopters, ground canvasses and dogs, and five boats in the Ohio River checking islands and the shoreline, McKinney said. Video of the two men at a Home Depot parking lot in Evansville, Indiana, around six hours before Wednesday’s pursuit also shows Gillespie with a pronounced limp, McKinney said. “It is our belief that he was injured during his escape in Ohio,” he said. Gillespie is 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, and in the video, he was seen wearing dark pants and a white shirt, but that was several days ago, police said. Meanwhile in Ohio, four corrections department employees have been placed on paid administrative leave as an investigation into the jailbreak continues, the department said. They are a major and three corrections officers. There is an internal investigation by the corrections departmen and a criminal investigation by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, the corrections department said. "
"Family of woman fatally stabbed in NYC apartment says police failed to intervene, waited an hour to enter",Marlene Lenthang,"May 26, 2023, 11:25 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The family of a New York woman who was followed into her apartment and stabbed more than 40 times has filed a lawsuit accusing police officers of idly standing by her door as she was fatally attacked. Christina Yuna Lee, 35, died Feb. 13, 2022, in her Chinatown, Manhattan, apartment. Police have that said Assamad Nash followed Lee into her apartment around 4:20 a.m., stealthily trailing her up six flights of stairs and forcing entry into her unit. Once inside, he repeatedly stabbed her, authorities previously said. Nash has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges. A complaint filed May 12 in New York County Supreme Court by Lee's aunt and administrator of her estate, Boksun Lee, accuses members of the NYPD of negligence in the slow response and failure to provide immediate medical care. The NYPD on Friday said did not comment on the case, citing  pending litigation. Neighbors called 911 after hearing Lee's screams, and one of those calls came in at 4:22 a.m., the suit states. Three minutes later, two unnamed members of the NYPD from the 5th precinct, located about three blocks from Lee’s apartment, arrived to Lee’s unit and heard her shouting for help “until she abruptly stopped screaming,” the complaint said. Instead of breaking into the unit, the officers spoke to Nash through the closed door, the complaint said. “Despite having reasons to believe Ms. Lee’s life was in imminent danger,” the officers “failed to gain entry to Ms. Lee’s apartment or otherwise provide her with any potentially life-saving police or medical assistance at that time,” the complaint said. Seven other members of the NYPD arrived at 5:30 a.m. — more than an hour after a neighbor called 911 and the first officers heard the woman screaming, the complaint said. At 5:40 a.m. — one hour and 20 minutes after Lee was attacked — members of the NYPD Emergency Services Unit forced entry into Lee’s apartment, the lawsuit said. She was found fatally stabbed and pronounced dead at 5:55 a.m., according to the suit. The complaint said that during and after the attack, responding NYPD members “denied and/or reasonably delayed providing Ms. Lee with police assistance and emergency medical treatment causing her pain and suffering and contributing to her death.” It also accused New York City of failing to maintain Sara D. Roosevelt Park, located near Lee's apartment, which had ""significant public safety conditions."" The complaint noted a stabbing death that happened just outside the park Oct. 16, 2021. Court documents said the “dangerous conditions” in the public park operated by the city “contributed to the harm and suffering” of Lee. New York City's Legal Department did not immediately return a request for comment. The suit alleges wrongful death, conscious pain and suffering, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, denial or delay of medical care, and negligent hiring, screening, retention, supervision and training of the officers. The suit further says that the defendants violated the New York State Constitution in depriving Lee of her life without due process of law. The family seeks a jury trial, punitive and unspecified compensatory damages. Lee, a Rutgers University graduate, was a senior creative producer at Splice, a digital music platform, Variety reported. Nash, who was not named in the suit, was charged with first-degree murder, burglary and sexually motivated burglar. He pleaded not guilty in March 2022. Prosecutors said that Nash had an extensive record in New Jersey and that at the time of Lee’s killing, he was out on supervised release in three open cases. If he is convicted, he faces a sentence as long as life without parole. "
Florida deputy charged after stun gun turned man covered with fuel into 'human fireball',Mirna Alsharif,"May 26, 2023, 10:34 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A Florida deputy accused of recklessly deploying a stun gun on a man who was covered in gasoline and became ""a human fireball"" has been charged in the incident at a gas station last year. Osceola County Deputy David Crawford was charged this week with one count of culpable negligence with personal injury, a first-degree misdemeanor, according to the State Attorney of the Ninth Judicial District. Jean Baretto had second- and third-degree burns to at least 75% of his body after the February 2022 incident at an Orlando gas station. Deputies were pursuing Baretto, who was ""accused of violating traffic laws as he 'popped wheelies' in traffic while on his dirt bike,"" and a struggle ensued, the state attorney's office said.

Crawford then deployed his Taser, setting Baretto on fire and turning him into ""a human fireball,"" NeJame said. Baretto will require lifelong care, his attorney said, adding that the man has accrued more the $7 million in medical expenses. NeJame says the charge ""is but a first tiny step.""

A Latina who's not allowed to wear Mexican American sash at high school graduation takes legal action,Edwin Flores,"May 26, 2023, 10:17 PM UTC",Latino,"A Colorado high school senior is taking legal action against her school district after officials denied her request to wear a sash with an image of the U.S. and Mexican flags during her upcoming graduation. The district’s decision is a violation of Naomi Villasano’s constitutionally protected right to free speech, according to a lawsuit filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), a Latino legal civil rights organization, and the Greenberg Traurig, LLP, law firm. According to the lawsuit involving Garfield County School District 16, Grand Valley High School Principal Kelly McCormick told Villasano, who's 18, that she couldn't wear the sash despite acknowledging that the school, located in the town of Parachute, didn't have a specific written policy about regalia worn on or over the graduation gown. Garfield County School District Superintendent Jennifer Baugh followed up by emailing Villasano and writing, “The district didn’t permit flags on regalia because it didn’t want to open the door to a student wearing a Confederate flag pin or flag that would cause offense,” the lawsuit stated. Villasano, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, argued before the school board that she's “a 200 percenter — 100% American and 100% Mexican,” and stated in the MALDEF news release that “it is important for me to represent my culture not only for myself but for my family."" The lawsuit claims she is being denied her right to free speech and calls upon the defendants to let her wear the sash at her graduation on Saturday. “We live in an age of increasing threats to the First Amendment in public schools,” said Thomas Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel. “Here, the district has wrongly concluded that it is allowed to discriminate against certain students and their heritage while honoring that of other students; our Constitution does not permit such obvious discrimination.” The district's superintendent, school board members and the Grand Valley High School principal are listed as defendants in the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. Responding to an email from NBC News, Superintendent Baugh said in a statement: “At this time, the District does not have a comment on the pending litigation."" Villasano said she’s fighting against the ban in hopes of making a change, “not just for Latinos, but for all future graduates so that nobody else has to go through what I’ve been through,” according to the statement. “A graduation is supposed to be a moment of celebration, but Garfield County School District 16 is depriving Naomi of the opportunity to celebrate her Mexican American heritage during one of the most important moments of her life,” said Kenneth Parreno, a staff attorney at MALDEF in the press release. “The United States Constitution and Colorado law protect the rights of students to express their heritage, and schools cannot pick and choose what types of cultural heritage can be celebrated.” "
"As cancer drug shortages grow, some doctors are forced to ration doses or delay care",Marina Kopf,"May 26, 2023, 9:43 PM UTC",Cancer,"Widespread shortages of cancer drugs are forcing doctors to make difficult decisions about how to treat their patients, including rationing doses and turning to other treatment options with potentially more side effects. As of Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration listed 14 cancer drugs in shortage. “The oncology shortage is especially critical,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf told NBC News. “I’m a former intensivist doctor and I’m very aware of the consequences if you can’t get needed chemotherapy.” According to a March report from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, drug shortages are at record highs. New drug shortages increased by nearly 30% between 2021 and 2022. By the end of 2022, there was a record five-year high of 295 active drug shortages. “I don’t know of a time that’s worse than this,” said Dr. Julie Gralow, the chief medical officer and executive vice president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. “What’s different about this shortage is, I think, it’s just the broad applicability of these drugs, how important they are, you know, globally, in the U.S., in the treatment of many diseases.” Among the drugs in shortage is carboplatin, a chemotherapy agent used as a first-line treatment for a number of cancers. “Carboplatin is such an important drug for the treatment of many cancers — breast cancer, ovarian, head and neck, lung cancer, among several others,” said Dr. Lucio Gordan, a medical oncologist and president of Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, a network of cancer clinics. Gordan said they were completely out of the drug for nearly two weeks. “I’ve been doing this for 20-plus years. This is the worst I’ve ever seen,” he said. Florida Cancer Specialists knew that the shortage was coming and tried to prepare. For the last couple of months, they’ve been rationing by rounding down doses of carboplatin by 10%, which Gordan said doesn’t diminish the drug’s efficacy. “We have been rounding down for a while,” he said. “But we just ran out of the drugs, so there’s nothing to be rounded.” Carrie Cherkinsky, 41, of Tallahassee, Florida, learned of the shortage from a Facebook support group for women with ovarian cancer. Even so, she was shocked to learn that she wouldn’t be able to get her second round of chemotherapy, scheduled for May 15, at Florida Cancer Specialists. Gordan was not involved with her care. “Who’s going to be held accountable for this?” said Cherkinsky, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in March. “For me not getting the lifesaving treatment?” Carboplatin isn’t just an effective drug; it’s also less toxic and causes fewer side effects than other available drugs. “One of the issues though with these alternative medications is often they’re not as good, so it may compromise survival outcomes,” said Dr. Angeles Alvarez Secord, president of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. In addition, “when there’s more toxicity, there’s more cost to the treatment because you’re also dealing with the side effects, or giving additional drugs to try to prevent the side effects,” Secord said. “So the alternatives often, even though they’re present, are still not meeting the best standard of care.” Nationwide, hospitals and cancer centers have been forced to make similar decisions when it comes to cancer care. According to a May survey conducted by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, doctors in at least 40 states have at least one chemotherapy drug in shortage. Dr. Eleonora Teplinsky, a breast and gynecologic medical oncologist at Valley Health System in New Jersey, said the shortages are devastating. “Cancer is life-changing as it is but you expect as a patient that you’re going to walk into an office and be given the very best that exists,” Teplinsky said. “And right now we don’t have the very best to give in certain cancers.” Drug shortages cause extra stress not only for cancer patients, but for medical providers as well. On top of being in a workforce that’s already burned out and exhausted from a pandemic, doctors have to scramble to find lifesaving treatments. “All the practices in the country, not only in oncology, we have been stressed out much more since Covid,” Gordan said. “This is another curveball that impedes us to do the best we can.” Shortages can sometimes catch providers off guard. Suppliers don’t give warning when a drug is about to be in shortage; they’ll just stop filling all of their orders, said Andrea Iannucci, the assistant chief pharmacist at UC Davis Health. “So we place an order, and we think it’s going to arrive and it doesn’t, because the drug was unavailable,” Iannucci said. Keri Carvill, 44, of Sacramento, California, was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in March but wasn’t able to get her first dose of carboplatin until May 19. Triple-negative breast cancer is a particularly aggressive form of the disease. “It’s stressful and scary,” Carvill said. The current carboplatin shortage was caused in part by quality concerns at one manufacturing facility, Intas Pharmaceuticals, in India, but experts say the real problem is more chronic. “Unfortunately, the profitability of this industry is very low or nonexistent,” Califf said. “A number of firms are going either out of business, or they’re having quality problems because of difficulty investing in their technology. That’s the core underlying reason for the shortage that we’re seeing.” In a statement to NBC News, Intas Pharmaceuticals said it is working with the FDA to release existing inventory of carboplatin and other medically necessary products. It is also working with the agency on a plan to resume manufacturing, but added that a date has not yet been confirmed for when that will happen. Califf said the FDA is working with additional manufacturers to make more carboplatin available. Long-term solutions, however, are going to require “intervention by Congress and the White House in order to get this industry in the right place,” he said, adding that a White House team has been working on the drug shortage issue. Teplinsky, the oncologist in New Jersey, said she’s been encouraging her social media followers to reach out to elected officials to advocate for timely production of chemotherapy drugs and long-term policies to ensure this doesn’t happen again. “Delaying care impacts outcomes,” Teplinsky said. “And so in this case, either we can’t give people what they need, or we have to wait, which we know will lead to negative consequences.”Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

"Pennsylvania nurse accused of killing 2 patients, injuring another with insulin injections",Minyvonne Burke,"May 26, 2023, 9:38 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A Pennsylvania nurse is accused of administering lethal doses of insulin to two patients, the state attorney general said. Heather Irene Pressdee, 40, of Natrona Heights, allegedly gave the patients ""overdoses of insulin"" while a registered nurse at Quality Life Services, a skilled nursing facility in Chicora, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General said in a news release. A criminal complaint says she was employed at the facility from May 23, 2022, to November 28, 2022. One patient died Dec. 4 and the other on Dec 25. They were 55 and 83 years old, the office said. A third patient, a 73-year-old man, was given an unhealthy amount of insulin on Aug. 31, 2022, but survived following emergency hospitalization, officials said. Two of the three patients were not diabetic. Their names have not been released. Pressdee was arrested at her home Wednesday on homicide, attempted murder, aggravated assault, neglect and reckless endangerment charges, according to the state AG. She was arraigned Wednesday night and is being held at the Butler County Prison without bail. It’s not clear if she has obtained an attorney. Attorney General Michelle Henry said the nurse was supposed to care for the patients but  ""intentionally and maliciously injected them with insulin to kill them."" ""The allegations in this case outline the callous abuse of incredibly vulnerable patients by a professional nurse,"" Henry said in a statement. ""As the charges indicate, these were deliberate and intentional acts perpetrated by a caregiver who was trusted to care for these victims."" Quality Life Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. Authorities launched an investigation after a victim's relative alleged in a complaint that the nurse was involved in the improper administration of insulin to patients under her care, according to a criminal complaint. All three victims were transported to the hospital because of low blood sugar immediately after a shift in which Pressdee cared for them, it says. One of the patients who died was nonverbal, according to the complaint, which identified him as J.B. He was taken to the hospital in October 2022, and a medical team determined he had critically low blood sugar, it says. He was treated and sent back to the facility. On Nov. 20, 2022, J.B. was again hospitalized for low blood sugar and died two weeks later. A nurse at the facility told authorities that Pressdee allegedly said J.B. would be ""better off dead,"" the complaint says. The other victim who died, identified in the complaint as J.C., was a hospice patient and suitemate of J.B. He was taken to the hospital 10 minutes after J.B.'s November hospitalization, according to the complaint. J.C.'s family opted to have him transferred back to the facility, where he died on Christmas Day, according to the complaint. The third victim, identified as E.A., was found seizing in his bed shortly after receiving care from Pressdee, the complaint states. He was taken to the hospital and sent to another facility. Pressdee told investigators that E.A. was in Covid isolation and had  asked her to ""kill him,"" according to the complaint. She allegedly said she removed insulin from the medication cart and gave him one syringe in his stomach. ""She stated that he began showing symptoms and that she did not address the symptoms, and the oncoming shift sent him to the hospital,"" it says. When asked about the other two victims, Pressdee allegedly said their quality of life was not good, the complaint says. She is accused of injecting each of them with 60 units of short-acting insulin. The complaint states that Pressdee has an alleged pattern of ""being disciplined for abusive behavior towards patients and/or staff"" at several other facilities and either resigned from them or was terminated.

'Fart spray' prank at Texas high school leads to criminal charges for 2 students,Mirna Alsharif,"May 26, 2023, 7:32 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Two students have been criminally charged after allegedly bringing “fart spray” to their Texas high school this month, a prank that led to evacuations, hospitalizations and canceled classes. Diego Flores, 18, and a boy, 17, were both charged with possession of a prohibited weapon, a third-degree felony, after authorities said they “intentionally or knowingly” possessed “a chemical dispensing device,” according to court records. (The 17-year-old is not being identified because NBC News does not usually name minors charged with a crime.) A strange odor at Caney Creek High School on May 3 and 4 prompted extensive testing of the campus' mechanical, ventilation and sewer systems. Multiple fire departments responded to the school, including Caney Creek Fire & Rescue, and determined that its air quality was safe and there was no odor in the building when it wasn't occupied by students, the school's principal, Jeff Stichler, said in a statement May 5. Students were temporarily evacuated May 3 after ""a gas smell near the cafeteria"" was discovered and dismissed at 1 p.m., Stichler said in a message to parents. There was no odor when students returned to campus the next day, but the smell returned at around 11:30 a.m., prompting another evacuation and early dismissal, according to another message from the principal. Some students had ""strong negative physical reactions to the odor,"" including headaches and nausea, and were taken to hospitals by ambulance, according to court documents. ""We have been told by multiple resources using advanced equipment that the presence of natural gas has not been detected on our campus — not yesterday and not today,"" Stichler told parents May 4. The school was closed May 5 to allow authorities to continue their probe into the source of odor. Following an investigation by police and the campus administration, the school said it believes students brought ""Hensgaukt Fart Spray"" in the building as part of a prank, causing the odor. Flores and the 17-year-old boy were booked into the Montgomery County Jail on May 12 and released on $3,000 bond the same day. Attorney Wendy Baker, who represents Flores, said her client was ""over charged."" ""I am completely offended that this young man has been charged with a third degree felony and if the State of Texas doesn’t come to their senses soon then we look forward to defending this case in a jury trial of Montgomery County citizens,"" Baker said in an email. The Conroe Independent School District deferred all comments on the incident to the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office. In a statement, the district attorney's office said there are several details it can't share at this time due to pending litigation, but that the incident wasn't just a harmless school prank. ""However, we can affirm that even the initial evidence outlined in the charges indicates that this incident goes beyond the scope of a benign school prank,"" the statement said. ""While being mindful of these details, we also fully understand and acknowledge the youth of the individuals involved in this case. The potential for impulsive decisions, especially among younger individuals, is a factor we consider during our pursuit of justice."" The district attorney's office says it is dedicated to a resolution considerate of the community, the victims and the futures of the suspects. ""We encourage those with concerns to exercise patience and allow the process to work to achieve those ends,"" the district attorney's office said. "
Winner of historic $2B Powerball sued by man who claims ticket was stolen from him,Marlene Lenthang,"May 26, 2023, 7:04 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The winner of California's $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot last year is being sued by a man who claims the ticket was stolen from him before the winning numbers were drawn. Edwin Castro was identified as the winner of the record-setting prize in February. At the time, he said he was “shocked and ecstatic” and chose to accept the jackpot in a lump sum payment of $997.6 million. The same month he was identified, a man named Jose Rivera filed a civil complaint in Alhambra Superior Court claiming the jackpot should be his. The suit was filed against Castro, the California State Lottery Commission, the state of California and a man named Urachi F. Romero, whom Rivera accused of taking his ticket. Rivera purchased the lottery ticket for the $2.04 billion Powerball on Nov. 7 at Joe’s Service Center in Altadena, California, one day before the draw, according to the complaint. Rivera alleges Romero stole the ticket that same day. The complaint did not detail how the alleged theft happen. After the ticket was allegedly stolen, Rivera made “numerous requests and demands to return it” but Romero refused, according to the complaint. On Nov. 8, the winning numbers were drawn and Rivera made renewed requests for Romero to return the ticket. Romero allegedly responded by saying “the ticket was a loser or if I find the ticket we can split the winnings 50/50,” the complaint said. Rivera reported the alleged theft to California Lottery and law enforcement, according to court documents. On Feb. 14, the California State Lottery Commission and the state of California announced Castro was the winner of the Powerball. Lottery officials said they followed a vetting process to assure the ticket and claim were legitimate. Rivera presented a claim form to California Lottery in Santa Fe Springs three days later, claiming his ticket was stolen. “Up until the announcement on February 14, 2023, Mr. Rivera had been threatened that his winning ticket would be destroyed if he did not agree to split the winnings,” a letter from Rivera's counsel said. The complaint said Rivera requested that California Lottery preserve all footage depicting the winning ticket being purchased at Joe’s Service Center. Rivera says he’s entitled to the jackpot, claiming he suffered emotional damages, trespass to chattel (meaning use of property without an owner’s permission) and intentional interference with prospective economic relations in the alleged ordeal. California Lottery said it does not comment on pending litigation but expressed ""utmost confidence"" in the organization's vetting process for winners. ""California Lottery remains confident that Edwin Castro is the rightful winner of the $2.04 billion prize stemming from the Powerball drawing in November of 2022,"" said Carolyn Becker, state lottery deputy director and spokesperson. A summons was served April 25 at a sprawling $25.5 million Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, home that was sold in March, according to online records. But the person at the home allegedly told process servers they were “serving the wrong Edwin Castro,” according to a May 17 filing. On Thursday, a motion to quash service of summons was filed by an attorney for Castro. It said that the summons was issued to Edwin H. Castro — the father of the actual Powerball winner. A declaration attached to the motion by Castro said he has never personally been issued a summons. He acknowledged that the L.A. home his father was served at was his. He did not address the claims regarding the ticket in his filing. A hearing is set for July 19 on that motion. NBC News has reached out to attorneys for Rivera and Castro for comment. Romero, who did not file a response in the court docket, could not be reached Friday. "
"12-year-old graduates college in California, setting school record",Sakshi Venkatraman,"May 26, 2023, 6:49 PM UTC",Asian America,"A 12-year-old last week became the youngest person ever to graduate from California’s Fullerton College. Clovis Hung, who started college when he was just 9 years old, said his decision to enroll was motivated by a sense of friendly competition. He said he heard about Fullerton alum Jack Rico, who at 13 years old set the previous record as the college’s youngest graduate, and set out to match his accomplishment. “I also wanted to be the youngest graduate,” Hung told Fullerton news station KABC. “I didn’t expect to beat him.” On Saturday, Hung walked across the stage in a cap and gown alongside fellow Fullerton graduates, most of them at least a decade his senior. He was awarded five associate of arts degrees: history; social sciences; social behavior and self-development; arts and human expression; and science and mathematics. He said he plans to pursue another one next year. Hung enrolled at Fullerton through the school’s Special Admit program, which allows students of any age to take courses for college credit. According to a press release by the school, Hung’s mom combined his college classes with a homeschooling curriculum to best meet his academic needs. “Clovis is super inquisitive, mature, diligent, self-disciplined and highly motivated,” Hung’s mother, Song Choi, said in the release. “He is also very curious and traditional public schools could not satisfy his curiosity, therefore, the best option was college.” Adjusting to an in-person college experience was daunting at first, Hung said, but he found a support system in his new professors and classmates. Everyone welcomed him with open arms and was glad to have discussions with him about course material, he said. “When I had questions, I asked them, and if they had questions, they’d ask me,” Hung said. “They treated me like a little brother.” Some of his professors worried about how he would relate to his older classmates, the release said, but soon found that he fit in seamlessly. “Clovis has been a great mixture of ‘kid’ and college student,” Fullerton biology professor Kenneth Collins said. “He is mature enough that the other students take him seriously, but enough of a kid that they look after him like a younger brother and cheer him on.” Like many recent grads, Hung plans to spend his summer traveling. He also plays basketball five days a week, enjoys Minecraft and Roblox, and is earning badges as a Boy Scout. “I also just joined the Civic Air Patrol and hope to get my pilot license at age 16,” he said in the release.

Bipartisan leaders invite Indian Prime Minister Modi to address Congress,Rose Horowitch,"June 2, 2023, 8:39 PM UTC",Congress,"The leaders of the House and Senate this week invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address a joint session of Congress during an official state visit on June 22. In a letter dated Thursday, the top Democrats and Republicans in each chamber said the speech would provide an opportunity to hear the prime minister's vision for India's future and views on the ""global challenges our countries both face."" The letter was signed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. “We look forward to paving the way for greater collaboration in the years to come,” the lawmakers wrote. Modi last addressed a joint meeting of Congress in 2016. The address “left a lasting impact and greatly deepened the friendship between the United States and India,” congressional leaders wrote in their letter. The Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the invitation. The United States in recent years has sought to strengthen ties with India, the world’s largest democracy, to counter China’s rising influence both regionally and globally. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden announced last month that they will host Modi for an official state visit, including a state dinner at the White House on June 22. Modi, who has served as India's top elected official since 2014, has been viewed as a controversial figure following deadly 2002 riots in Gujarat when he was chief minister of the Indian state. In 2005, he was denied a visa to the United States over the riots, which killed more than 1,000 people, but India’s Supreme Court last year upheld a ruling that he should be cleared of all charges related to the riots. Modi has denied any wrongdoing. Modi's visit to the U.S. comes as relations between Washington and New Delhi have grown fractious at times, particularly over the amount of oil India has purchased from Russia, which helps it in its war against Ukraine. India has maintained a neutral stance toward the war in Ukraine. But the U.S. and India are largely aligned on efforts to address China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region and on climate change. India and China have had multiple skirmishes along their border in recent years, with the most significant clash taking place in June 2020 when India said 20 of its soldiers were killed. "
45 bags of human remains found in western Mexico amid search for missing call center workers,Mirna Alsharif,"June 2, 2023, 5:16 PM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 7:35 PM UTC",World,"Forty-five bags filled with human remains were found in the western Mexican state of Jalisco on Tuesday, officials said. Investigators with the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office were searching for seven young call center workers when they made the gruesome discovery in a 40-meter deep ravine, according to a statement. The call center workers disappeared last week from the Jardines Vallarta and La Estancia neighborhoods in Jalisco. The State Prosecutor’s Office is continuing its search for the call center employees as it’s not clear if the remains belong to them. Police responded to the Mirador del Bosque ravine in the city of Zapopan on Tuesday afternoon after receiving information about possible evidence related to the missing people. A black plastic bag with human remains was found, triggering a search effort. At least 45 bags with human remains belonging to both men and women were found. The Jalisco Forensic Medical Service is working to identify  the remains and determine how many bodies were found and the cause of death. Jalisco has been plagued with violence in recent years, especially at the hands of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). In 2020, the U.S. Justice Department announced more than 750 arrests after a six-month investigation targeting the Mexican drug cartel. “CJNG has contributed to a catastrophic trail of human and physical destruction in Mexico,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczowski at the time. “It is the most well-armed cartel in Mexico. Its members willingly confront rival cartels and even the security forces of the Mexican government. CJNG is responsible for grisly acts of violence and loss of life.” "
"In El Salvador, Bukele pledges prison for white-collar criminals like the one for gangs",Reuters,"June 2, 2023, 7:06 PM UTC",Latino,"SAN SALVADOR — El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele on Thursday pledged to build a prison to hold white-collar criminals as part of a crackdown on corruption that he likened to his fight against criminal gangs. “Just as we fought the gangs head on with the full force of the state, we will launch a full-on war against corruption,” he said during a national address to mark his fifth year of being in office. “Just as we built a prison for the terrorists, we will build one for the corrupt.” Bukele launched a brutal campaign on the country’s violent gangs over a year ago, suspending constitutional rights in a so-called state of exception. The policy has won broad popular support but human rights groups say innocent people have been caught up in the crackdown. The government in February moved thousands of suspected gang members to a newly opened “mega prison.” “We will fight white-collar criminals wherever they come from,” Bukele added, “but we will only use legal means.” Bukele also used his speech to announce bills to slim down the country’s political system by cutting the number of deputies in the country’s unicameral Congress to 60 from 84, and turn the small Central American country’s 262 municipalities into 44 districts. These bills will need to be voted through Congress, he said. Later in the speech, Bukele said former President Alfredo Cristiani’s property was being raided. A court ordered Cristiani’s provisional arrest over a year ago for alleged involvement in covering up the murder of six Jesuit priests and two of their staff during the country’s civil war in the 1980s. The address ended to shouts of “re-election” from the gathering in the Congress. In March, a newspaper poll showed that nearly 70% of Salvadorans favored Bukele’s bid for a second term, despite an explicit constitutional prohibition against serving consecutive terms. Bukele’s presidential term ends next year. "
Elon Musk leaves China after whirlwind trip filled with praise and politics,Larissa Gao,"June 2, 2023, 3:02 PM UTC",World,"HONG KONG — A figure of growing controversy in the United States, tech billionaire Elon Musk enjoyed praise and the occasional foray into geopolitics on a visit to China this week. The Tesla and Twitter CEO — newly restored to the position of world's richest man — was welcomed by top officials and showered with praise by members of the public during his two-day trip. Musk expressed his opposition to the ""decoupling"" of the world's two largest economies, a sign of the growing tensions belied by his warm welcome. During the whirlwind trip, Musk met with China’s foreign, commerce and industry ministers as well as senior business figures. He was greeted by Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing after landing in the Chinese capital Tuesday. Though Musk made limited public comments and details of the meetings remained largely private, the foreign ministry quoted him as describing the U.S. and Chinese economies as “conjoined twins” and saying that he was opposed to moves that might undo that. Relations between Washington and Beijing have soured over a range of issues including human rights and the status of Taiwan, with the U.S. and its allies increasingly seeking to reduce their economic reliance on China. On Wednesday, Musk went to Tesla's Shanghai factory and expressed his gratitude to staff at the automaker’s biggest production hub, according to a video posted on the official Tesla account on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. He also met with a senior Shanghai official. It's a far cry from his status in the U.S., where Musk’s stewardship of Twitter and his political activities have drawn rising scrutiny. He recently defended his promotion of conspiracy theories but said he wouldn’t stop sharing extremist views despite broad condemnation. Tesla has faced backlash in China in recent years, but Musk's welcome this week extended to the Chinese public, with social media filled with praise for the billionaire. ""Musk is not only an entrepreneur but also a scientist. He is someone we have to admire,"" one comment on Weibo read. Another described him as a ""global idol."" Hu Xijin, the retired editor of the state-backed newspaper Global Times, noted a rise in Tesla's stock price and said Friday on Weibo that Musk was the “trendsetter” of his time because he had “clearly penetrated the geopolitics.” “It is unusual to be in the limelight and popular in both the U.S. and China today,” he added. Analysts agreed Musk was trying to pull off a delicate balancing act in courting China while avoiding further backlash in the U.S. “Musk basically took the U.S.-China decoupling thesis and threw it out the window,” Daniel Ives, an analyst at U.S.-based investment firm Wedbush Securities, told NBC News. “This is a tightrope these titans are walking in the geopolitical poker game going on between the U.S. and China.” Musk, who this week became the world's richest person again according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has long been a popular figure on Chinese social media. He has over 2 million followers on Weibo, with thousands of likes on his most recent posts. But while in China Musk was not as active as usual on Twitter, the site he owns that is officially blocked in the country. ""Despite his self-proclaimed detest for censorship and willingness to challenge it, he is behaving properly for his CCP host,"" said Yaqiu Wang, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, referring to the initials of the Chinese Communist Party. Musk left Shanghai on Thursday, ending his first visit to China in three years as the country once again courts global business after the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. He last visited Tesla’s Shanghai factory in 2020. China is crucial to Musk's business, with Tesla facing intensifying competition from Chinese-made electric vehicles and some recent backlash over safety and data security concerns, which Musk previously sought to ease. The Shanghai plant produced over 700,000 Model Y and Model 3 vehicles last year, more than half of the company’s global output. China’s electric vehicle market is “the lynchpin and core DNA of Tesla from both a demand and production perspective,” Ives said. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. Despite the intensifying clash between the U.S. and China, a number of CEOs from American companies have visited the country in recent months. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan have been to China, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also plans to visit, according to Bloomberg. "
"China's Ukraine envoy urges countries to ‘stop sending weapons to the battlefield,’ negotiate peace",Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 10:11 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"China’s Ukraine envoy appealed Friday to other governments to “stop sending weapons to the battlefield” and hold peace talks but gave no indication that his trip to the region made any progress toward a settlement. Li Hui’s appeal came as Washington and its European allies are ramping up supplies of missiles, tanks and other weapons to Ukrainian forces that are trying to take back Russian-occupied territory. Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s government says it is neutral and wants to serve as a mediator but has supported Moscow politically. “China believes that if we really want to put an end to war, to save lives and realize peace, it is important for us to stop sending weapons to the battlefield, or else the tensions will only spiral up,” Li told reporters. Li visited Ukraine, Russia, Poland, France, Germany and the European Union headquarters during a May 15-28 trip. Political analysts saw little chance that the Chinese initiative would make progress, but it gives Beijing an opportunity to expand its global diplomatic role. Beijing released a proposed peace plan in February, but Ukraine’s allies insisted President Vladimir Putin must first withdraw Russian forces. China sees Moscow as a diplomatic and military partner in opposing United States domination of global affairs. Beijing has refused to criticize the invasion and used its status as one of five permanent United Nations Security Council members to deflect diplomatic attacks on Russia. "
"World’s wheat supply at risk of a dangerous shock due to heat and drought, study warns",Evan Bush,"June 2, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Climate in Crisis,"Extreme heat waves and drought due to climate change have the potential to shock the global food supply and send prices soaring, according to a new study. The research, published Friday in the journal npj Climate and Atmospheric Science, assesses a worst-case scenario in which extreme weather hits two breadbasket regions in the same year, hammering winter wheat crops in both the U.S. Midwest and northeastern China. Winter wheat is planted in the fall, goes dormant in winter cold, then gets harvested in early summer. The study found that the extreme weather conditions that would push those wheat crops beyond their physiological tolerances are becoming more likely. If such weather affected multiple regions at once — a scenario possible in today’s climate — it could stress the global food system in dangerous ways. Erin Coughlan de Perez, the study’s lead author and a climate scientist and associate professor at Tufts University, said the research was meant to show political leaders and disaster responders the degree to which a critical crop is under threat, so that they can prepare accordingly for such a crisis. “We’re suffering from a failure of imagination in terms of what this could look like,” Coughlan de Perez said. “The whole point of imagining these serious consequences — we could take action to prevent them and build a more resilient system.” Already, climate change is disrupting food production across the globe. The Horn of Africa, for example, suffered several years of drought beginning in 2020 that killed livestock and wiped out crops. The World Weather Attribution Network determined climate change was responsible for that drought, which left more than 4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. This year, late rain in China’s largest wheat-growing province, Henan, is complicating efforts to harvest grain already damaged by wet weather, Reuters reported. "
Jordan’s crown prince weds scion of Saudi family in ceremony packed with stars and symbolism,Associated Press,"June 1, 2023, 11:52 AM UTC / Updated June 2, 2023, 8:47 AM UTC",U.K. Royals,"Jordan’s crown prince married the scion of a prominent Saudi family on Thursday in a palace ceremony attended by royals and other VIPs from around the world, as massive crowds gathered across the kingdom to celebrate the region’s newest power couple. The marriage of Crown Prince Hussein, 28, and Saudi architect Rajwa Alseif, 29, drew a star-studded guest list including Britain’s Prince William and his wife Kate, as well as U.S. First Lady Jill Biden. The celebrations hold deep significance for the region, emphasizing continuity in an Arab state prized for its longstanding stability and refreshing the monarchy’s image after a palace feud. It even could help resource-poor Jordan forge a strategic bond with its oil-rich neighbor, Saudi Arabia. The bride, wearing an elegant white dress by Lebanese designer Elie Saab, arrived at Zahran Palace in a 1968 Rolls-Royce Phantom V custom-made for the crown prince’s late great grandmother. The crown prince arrived earlier in full ceremonial military uniform with a gold-hilted saber. The families and their guests gathered in an open-air gazebo decked with flowers and surrounded by landscaped gardens for a traditional Muslim wedding ceremony known as “katb al-ketab.” The crowd erupted in applause after the signing of the marriage contract. Alseif will henceforth be known as Her Royal Highness Princess Rajwa Al Hussein, according to a royal decree. Several miles away, a jolt went through a packed ancient Roman amphitheater as viewers watched the couple seal their vows and exchange rings on a wide screen. After several minutes of stillness, the crowd of some 18,000 people were on their feet, waving flags and shrieking with excitement at one of several viewing parties held across the nation. Samara Aqrabawi, a 55-year-old mother watching the livestream with her young daughter, said the ceremony was more impressive than she imagined. “I wish for all mothers and fathers in Jordan and in the world to feel like they’re surely feeling,” she said of the king and queen. The newlyweds later emerged from the palace in a white custom Range Rover escorted by several bright red Land Rovers, motorcycles and a military marching band — a nod to the traditional horse-mounted processions during the reign of the country’s founder, King Abdullah I. The kingdom declared Thursday a public holiday so crowds of people could gather to wave at the couple’s motorcade amid a heavy security presence across the city. Tens of thousands of well-wishers attended free concerts and cultural events. On Thursday morning, Saudi wedding guests and tourists — the men wearing white dishdasha robes and the women in brightly colored abayas — filtered through the marbled lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel in Amman. Noura Al Sudairi, an aunt of the bride, was wearing sweatpants and sneakers on her way to breakfast. “We are all so excited, so happy about this union,” she said. “Of course it’s a beautiful thing for our families, and for the relationship between Jordan and Saudi Arabia.” Excitement over the nuptials — Jordan’s biggest royal event in decades — has been building in the capital of Amman, where congratulatory banners of Hussein and his beaming bride adorn buses and hang over winding hillside streets. Shops had competing displays of royal regalia. “She looks like such a princess that I think she deserves him,” Suhair Afaneh, a 37-year-old businesswoman, said of the bride, lingering in front of a portrait of Hussein in a dark suit. “But so what, I’ll still be in love with him.” She contemplated buying Hussein’s portrait to hang in her bedroom but her nieces persuaded her that her husband might not approve. Jordan’s 11 million residents have watched the young crown prince rise in prominence in recent years, as he increasingly joined his father, Abdullah, in public appearances. Hussein has graduated from Georgetown University, joined the military and gained some global recognition speaking at the U.N. General Assembly. His wedding, experts say, marks his next crucial rite of passage. “It’s not just a marriage, it’s the presentation of the future king of Jordan,” said political analyst Amer Sabaileh. “The issue of the crown prince has been closed.” The wedding may create a brief feel-good moment for Jordanians during tough economic times, including persistent youth unemployment and an ailing economy. Palace officials have turned the event — a week after Jordan’s 77th birthday — into something of a PR campaign. Combining tradition and modernity, the royal family introduced a wedding hashtag (#Celebrating Al Hussein) and omnipresent logo that fuses the couple’s initials into the Arabic words “We rejoice.” Zahran Palace in Amman, where the marriage ceremony was held, hasn’t seen such pomp and circumstance since 1993, when, on a similarly sunny June day, Abdullah married Rania, who was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents. Decades earlier, Abdullah’s father, the late King Hussein, sealed his vows in the same garden with his second wife, the British citizen Antoinette Gardiner. In addition to the Prince and Princess of Wales, the guest list includes an array of foreign aristocrats and dignitaries, including senior royals from Europe and Asia, as well as U.S. climate envoy John Kerry. Other likely attendees include Saudi aristocrats, as Rajwa’s mother comes from the same influential family as the late mother of King Salman. Her billionaire father owns a major construction firm in the kingdom. Both Rajwa and Kate wore gowns by the Lebanese designer Elie Saab, said a spokeswoman for the company, Maryline Mossino. The motorcade drove through Amman to the Al Husseiniya Palace, a 30-minute drive away, for the reception. There, the newlyweds walked beneath an arch of swords and were welcomed with a traditional zaffeh, a lively musical procession featuring drums, dancing, singing and clapping. The royals greeted more than 1,700 guests at the reception, which featured live music and a banquet. The celebrations were capped with a fireworks display that could be seen across the capital. Experts consider the marriage an advantageous alliance for the Hashemites, historic rivals of the Al Saud family to the east. Jordan has recently sought closer ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab petro-states, which once doled out billions of dollars to the aid-dependent country but since have reined in their spending. Even as restaurants blared call-and-response Arabic wedding songs and cars honked in celebration downtown, some signaled the royal fairy tale was fraught as Jordanians struggle to make ends meet. Osama, a 25-year-old bookseller, was thrilled about the occasion and festooned his car and shop windows with portraits of the royal family. But he also knew reality would return quickly. “Of course, it’s joyful,” he said, declining to give his last name for fear of reprisals. “But in a couple days, we’ll just go back to our problems.” "
Newly discovered stone tools drag dawn of Greek archaeology back by a quarter-million years,Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 8:39 AM UTC",World,"Deep in an open coal mine in southern Greece, researchers have discovered the antiquities-rich country’s oldest archaeological site, which dates to 700,000 years ago and is associated with modern humans’ hominin ancestors. The find announced Thursday would drag the dawn of Greek archaeology back by as much as a quarter of a million years, although older hominin sites have been discovered elsewhere in Europe. The oldest, in Spain, dates to more than a million years ago. The Greek site was one of five investigated in the Megalopolis area during a five-year project involving an international team of experts, a Culture Ministry statement said. It was found to contain rough stone tools from the Lower Palaeolithic period — about 3.3 million to 300,000 years ago — and the remains of an extinct species of giant deer, elephants, hippopotamus, rhinoceros and a macaque monkey. The project was directed by Panagiotis Karkanas of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Eleni Panagopoulou from the Greek Culture Ministry and Katerina Harvati, a professor of paleoanthropology at the University of Tübingen in Germany. The artifacts are “simple tools, like sharp stone flakes, belonging to the Lower Paleolithic stone tool industry,” the co-directors said in comments e-mailed to The Associated Press. They said it’s possible the items were produced by Homo antecessor, the hominin species dating from that period in other parts of Europe. Homo antecessor is believed to have been the last common ancestor of modern humans and their extinct Neanderthal cousins, who diverged about 800,000 years ago. “However, we will not be able to be sure until hominin fossil remains are recovered,” the project directors said. “(The site) is the oldest currently known hominin presence in Greece, and it pushes back the known archaeological record in the country by up to 250,000 years.” The tools, which were likely used for butchering animals and processing wood or other plant matter, were made about 700,000 years ago, though the researchers said they were awaiting further analyses to refine the dating. “We are very excited to be able to report this finding, which demonstrates the great importance of our region for understanding hominin migrations to Europe and for human evolution in general,” the three co-directors said. Archaeologist Nikos Efstratiou, a professor of prehistoric archaeology at Greece’s University of Thessaloniki who was not involved in the project, said the discovery was “very important” in itself, not just because it represented the country’s oldest known site. “There is an archaeological context in which tools, and remains of animals, have been found,” Efstratiou said. “It’s an important and very early site ... that allows us to move far back, and in an authoritative manner, the age of the first tools in Greece.” Another of the sites investigated in the Megalopolis area of the southern Peloponnese peninsula — home of the enormously later sites of Mycenae, Olympia and Pylos — contained the oldest Middle Palaeolithic remains found in Greece, dating to roughly 280,000 years ago. “(It’s) one of the oldest sites in Europe that have tools characteristic of the so called Middle Palaeolithic tool industry, suggesting that Greece may have played a significant role in (stone) industry developments in Europe,” the researchers said. The Megalopolis plain has for decades been mined for coal to supply a local power plant. During Palaeolithic times it contained a shallow lake. The area has long been known as a source of fossils, and in ancient times huge prehistoric bones dug up there were linked with the Greek myths of a long-vanished race of giants that fought the gods of Olympus. Some ancient writers cited Megalopolis as the site of a major battle in that supernatural war. "
Clashes in Senegal leave at least 9 dead; government bans use of social media platforms,Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 8:30 AM UTC",World,"Clashes between police and supporters of Senegalese opposition leader Ousmane Sonko left nine people dead, the government said Friday, with authorities issuing a blanket ban on the use of several social media platforms in the aftermath of the violence. The deaths occurred mainly in the capital, Dakar, and Ziguinchor in the south, where Sonko is mayor, Interior Minister Antoine Felix Abdoulaye Diome said in a statement. Some social media sites used by demonstrators to incite violence, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter have been suspended, he said. “The state of Senegal has taken every measure to guarantee the safety of people and property. We are going to reinforce security everywhere in the country,” Diome said. Sonko was convicted Thursday of corrupting youth but acquitted on charges of raping a woman who worked at a massage parlor and making death threats against her. The court sentenced Sonko to two years in prison. He didn’t attend his trial in Dakar, and was judged in absentia. His lawyer said a warrant hadn’t been issued yet for the politician’s arrest. Sonko came in third in Senegal’s 2019 presidential election and is popular with the country’s youth. His supporters maintain his legal troubles are part of a government effort to derail his candidacy in the 2024 presidential election. Sonko is considered President Macky Sall’s main competition and has urged Sall to state publicly that he won’t seek a third term in office. Corrupting young people, which includes using one’s position of power to have sex with people under the age of 21, is a criminal offense in Senegal that is punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to more than $6,000. Under Senegalese law, his conviction would bar Sonko from running in next year’s election, said Bamba Cisse, another defense lawyer. "
Japan demographic woes deepen as birth rate hits record low,Associated Press,"June 2, 2023, 8:16 AM UTC",World,"Japan’s birth rate declined for the seventh consecutive year in 2022 to a record low, the health ministry said on Friday, underscoring the sense of crisis gripping the country as the population shrinks and ages rapidly. The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to a woman in her lifetime, was 1.2565. That compares with the previous low of 1.2601 posted in 2005 and is far below the rate of 2.07 considered necessary to maintain a stable population. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has made arresting the country’s sliding birth rate a top priority and his government, despite high levels of debt, plans to earmark spending of 3.5 trillion yen ($25 billion) a year on child care and other measures to support parents. “The youth population will start decreasing drastically in the 2030s. The period of time until then is our last chance to reverse the trend of dwindling births,” he said this week while visiting a daycare facility. The pandemic has exacerbated Japan’s demographic challenges, with fewer marriages in recent years contributing to fewer births and Covid-19 partly responsible for more deaths. The number of newborns in Japan slid 5% to 770,747 last year, a new low, while the number of deaths shot 9% higher to a record 1.57 million, the data showed. More than 47,000 deaths in Japan last year were caused by the coronavirus pandemic. "
Global survey finds 9% of adults identify as LGBTQ,Julie Moreau,"June 1, 2023, 8:44 PM UTC",OUT News,"Nearly 1 in 10 adults across 30 countries identify as LGBTQ, according to a new global survey, but that number tells only part of the story. Age and geographic location played a central role in the findings, with younger respondents and those in more progressive countries significantly more likely to be included in that top-line number. Demographics, including gender, also figured noticeably in respondents' views on issues like transgender discrimination and same-sex marriage. Ipsos, a market-research company, surveyed 22,514 participants in 30 countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia in February and March, and found that 3% identified as lesbian or gay, 4% as bisexual, 0.9% as pansexual or omnisexual, and 0.9% as asexual. Survey respondents in Generation Z (born after 1997) were two times as likely as millennials (born in 1981 to 1996) to identify as bisexual, pansexual, omnisexual or asexual, and four times as likely as those in Generation X (1965 to 1980) or baby boomers (1948 to 1964). When survey results were broken down by geography, respondents in Spain were the most likely (6%) to identify as gay or lesbian, while those in Brazil and the Netherlands were the most likely to identify as bisexual (both 7%). By contrast, respondents in Japan were the least likely to identify as gay or lesbian (less than 1%) or as bisexual (1%). In terms of gender identity, 0.8% of respondents identified as transgender; 1.3% percent as nonbinary, gender nonconforming or gender fluid; and 0.7% did not identify with any of these categories but also did not identify as male or female. Like sexual identity, there are large — and growing — generation gaps. While 6% of Generation Z respondents identified as something other than exclusively male or only female, 3% of millennials reported the same, while only 1% of Generation X and boomers did. “We are seeing generational shifts. Globally, only 4% of boomers identify as LGBT+ versus 18% of Gen Z,” Nicolas Boyon, a senior vice president at Ipsos, told NBC News. “Older generations are seeing this and are probably a little bit puzzled.” Globally, LGBTQ visibility has increased since 2021, when Ipsos last conducted its global survey. Nearly half (47%) of adults say they have a relative, friend or colleague who is lesbian or gay, up from 42% in 2021, and more than a quarter (26%) say they know someone who is bisexual, an increase of 2 percentage points from 2021. When it comes to gender identity, 13% know someone who is trans, an increase of 3 percentage points since 2021. The number of people who say they know someone who is LGBTQ varies widely by country. The highest visibility for gays, lesbians and bisexuals was in Brazil, Spain, Chile and New Zealand, while visibility was the lowest in Japan, South Korea, Romania and Turkey. Gender diversity was most visible in Thailand, New Zealand, the U.S. and Australia, and least visible in Romania, South Korea, Japan and Hungary. Younger people and women were more likely than men and older respondents to know someone who is LGBTQ, and younger people in particular were much more likely to know someone who is transgender, the report found. Globally, 67% of respondents said transgender people confront a fair or great deal of discrimination, while 19% said they face little to no discrimination. And more than three quarters (76%) of those surveyed — representing a majority in each of the 30 countries surveyed — said transgender people should be protected from discrimination in employment, housing and businesses such as restaurants and stores. A majority of respondents also said they support trans-inclusive policies that have become political flashpoints in several countries: 60% said trans teens should be able to access gender-affirming care with parental consent; 55% said trans people should be allowed to access single-sex facilities that match their gender identity; and 53 percent said government-issued IDs should include options other than male or female. Thailand and Chile were among the countries most in favor of pro-transgender measures, while the U.S. and the United Kingdom — where trans issues have  “polarizing political issues,” according to the report — were among the least. More than half of all respondents (56%) said gay marriage should be legal, and an additional 16% said same-sex couples should be able to receive some form of legal recognition. By contrast, 14% opposed any form of legal recognition, and an additional 14% were unsure. In the 20 countries surveyed where same-sex marriage is already legal, support for it ranged from 49% to 80%, with only Colombia coming in below the halfway mark. In the other 10, a majority support some form of recognition, with the exception of Turkey. Support for same-sex marriage, however, has “softened in several Western countries since 2021,” the report found. Of the 23 countries surveyed both this year and in 2021, the report found that nine showed a decline of 4 percentage points or more in the support of same-sex marriage, including the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Only two countries surveyed both years showed an increase of 4 percentage points or more: France and Peru. “We see that there tends to be a lot of opposition where trans rights are a very political issue,” Boyon said. “I wonder if, to some extent, the political polarization has not spilled over to views about same-sex marriage and adoption.” Similar patterns were also found regarding adoption by same-sex couples. Globally, 64% of respondents said same-sex couples should have the same adoption rights as opposite-sex couples, though the report found that support for same-sex adoption has “declined significantly” in the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden and Turkey. Women and younger respondents were more likely to support same-sex marriage and adoption than men and older respondents. “Most LGBT+ related trends cross borders,” Boyon said. And while African and Middle Eastern countries are not represented in the sample, he said the survey allows “cross-country comparisons and brings to light patterns that are often not limited to one country or one region.” "
Truck driver detained after spilled potatoes wreak havoc on key bridge in Denmark,Associated Press,"June 1, 2023, 12:42 PM UTC",World,"A 57-year-old truck driver was detained Thursday after loads of potatoes were found spilled on a key bridge linking two Danish islands, police have said. The driver was held on suspicion of causing reckless endangerment to life. A first spill was reported on the westbound side of the Storebaelt bridge at 6.35 a.m. (12:35 a.m. ET), police spokesman Kenneth Taanquist said. The bridge connects the island where the capital, Copenhagen, is located to the rest of Denmark. A similar incident happened on the eastbound side a short time later, Tanquist added. ”It looks weird,” he said. “We are working on two hypotheses: it is either an accident or it is something that has been done deliberately.” Police said the roads had become slippery and urged drivers to drive slowly. According to the Danish Road Directorate, lines of vehicles were reported on either side of the roughly 18-kilometer (11 .2 miles) bridge and tunnel link between the islands of Funen, where Odense — Denmark’s third largest city — is located, and Zealand, where Copenhagen sits. A third incident of potatoes on the road was reported near the town of Kolding on the Jutland peninsula. Kolding is near the Storebaelt bridge. Danish public broadcaster DR noted that the potato spills occurred on the same day as the Danish parliament passed a law to tax diesel trucks transporting heavy loads. The new measure has drawn protests from truck drivers. In recent weeks, they peacefully blocked highways and main roads throughout the country, claiming the tax will make their livelihoods unsustainable. A majority in the Danish parliament argue it is vital as the continued use of gas and diesel-fueled trucks is environmentally unsustainable. As of 2025, the drivers of gas and diesel-fueled vehicles over 3.5 tons (7, 716 pounds) will be taxed 1.3 kroner ($0.19) per kilometer driven (half a mile). Torben Dyhl Hjorth, a spokesman for the protesting truckers, said on Facebook that they “strongly distance themselves from today’s ‘stunts’.” He added that they plan protest at a later stage which ”can be felt but without risk to people’s lives and well-being.” "
German prosecutors say they’ll examine objects found in Madeleine McCann search in Portugal,Associated Press,"June 1, 2023, 12:24 PM UTC",World,"German prosecutors said Thursday that they will examine objects that were found in a search in Portugal last week for clues regarding the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, but can’t yet say whether they are linked to the British girl who went missing in 2007. Investigators spent three days last week searching around a dam some 30 miles from the Praia da Luz resort in southern Portugal, where the 3-year-old girl was last seen 16 years ago. The search was instigated by prosecutors in Braunschweig, Germany, who are investigating a German man in connection with her disappearance. In a brief statement Thursday, prosecutors said that “some objects were secured,” without giving further details. “These will be evaluated in the coming days and weeks,” they added. “It cannot yet be said whether individual objects are actually related to the Madeleine McCann case.” They thanked Portuguese and British police for their cooperation and added that they expect their investigation of the 46-year-old suspect in the case will continue for a long time. In mid-2020, German officials said the German citizen, identified by media as Christian Brueckner, was a suspect in the case. Brueckner has denied any involvement. Brueckner is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for raping a 72-year-old woman in Portugal in 2005. He is under investigation on suspicion of murder in the McCann case but hasn’t been charged. He spent many years in Portugal, including in Praia da Luz, around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. The case of Madeleine McCann stirred worldwide interest for several years, with reports of sightings of her stretching as far away as Australia, along with a slew of books and television documentaries about the case. British, Portuguese and German investigators are still piecing together what happened on the night when the toddler disappeared from her bed in the southern Portuguese resort on May 3, 2007. She was in the same room as her brother and sister — 2-year-old twins — while her parents had dinner with friends at a nearby restaurant. "
"Russian bombardment of Ukraine’s capital kills at least 3 people, including a child",Associated Press,"June 1, 2023, 10:56 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"A pre-dawn Russian missile attack on Ukraine’s capital killed three people, including a 9-year-old and her mother, officials said, and inflicted the highest casualty toll from a single attack on Kyiv over the past month. The latest Russian attack, using what Ukrainian officials said were short-range Iskander ground-launched missiles, coincided with events scheduled in Kyiv to celebrate International Children’s Day. Those events were canceled. Ukrainian air defenses shot down all 10 cruise and ballistic missiles launched by the Kremlin’s forces, but falling debris caused damage and casualties on the ground, wounding 16 people, according to authorities. Russia has kept up a steady barrage on the Ukrainian capital and other parts of the country in recent weeks as Kyiv readies what it says is a counteroffensive to push back Moscow’s troops, 15 months after their full-scale invasion. Kyiv was the target of a reported 17 drone and missile attacks last month. Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska said one child was in hospital after the attack. “Children’s Day has to be about safe childhood, summer, life,” she tweeted. “But today it is about new crimes of (Russia) against children.” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that the dead included a 9-year-old girl, her mother and another woman. U.N. human rights monitors said six children were killed and 34 were wounded last month alone. Since February 2022, at least 525 children have been killed and at least 1,047 have been injured, according to the U.N.’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. “Sadly, as the world marks International Children’s Day, there is little to celebrate in Ukraine where civilians, including children, continue to pay a heavy price” said Matilda Bogner, the mission’s chief. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense cited different figures for child casualties in the war, saying at least 484 children have been killed and 992 injured. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the differences with the U.N. figures. Russia has repeatedly targeted Kyiv with waves of drone and missile attacks since the start of the invasion, but attacks against the capital have significantly intensified over the past month. While most incoming weapons are shot down, many Kyiv residents are anxious and tired after weeks of sleepless nights listening to the sound of explosions. Thursday’s onslaught also damaged apartment buildings, a medical clinic, a water pipeline and cars. Earlier, the city government had said that two children were killed before revising the number to one. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said authorities were investigating why a shelter at a medical facility was locked, preventing some people from taking shelter during the bombardment. He gave orders to the heads of the city’s districts to immediately check if all the shelters in Kyiv are accessible. "
Tennis star Djokovic stands by Kosovo comments after criticism,Reuters,"June 1, 2023, 10:46 AM UTC",World,"Serbian Novak Djokovic said he stood by his statement on Kosovo but wished to put the controversy behind him after his second-round victory at the French Open on Wednesday.

U.S. warns China: Not talking risks incidents ‘spiraling’,Larissa Gao,"June 1, 2023, 9:56 AM UTC / Updated June 1, 2023, 10:19 AM UTC",World,"HONG KONG — The U.S. is pushing China to talk, warning that Beijing's apparent refusal to restore high-level military communication means dangerous incidents could ""spiral out of control."" Two senior U.S. officials have voiced the criticism in the past 24 hours, pointing to the recent encounter between military aircraft over the South China Sea as evidence of the risks. China has blamed U.S. sanctions and what it sees as a broader effort to contain its rise, suggesting it's up to Washington to take action that could ease tensions. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday it was ""unfortunate"" that China's defense minister had declined to meet with him, and he criticized Beijing for its ""provocative"" actions. ""As we take a look at some of the things that China is doing in the international airspace in the region and in the international waterways, the provocative intercepts of our aircraft and also our allies’ aircraft, that's very concerning, and we would hope that they would alter their actions,"" Austin said at a news conference in Tokyo after having met with his Japanese counterpart. ""I'm concerned about, at some point, having an incident that could quickly spiral out of control,"" Austin added. The U.S. Defense Department said Tuesday that a Chinese fighter jet flew directly in front of the nose of a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea last week, describing it as an “unnecessarily aggressive maneuver.” China blamed U.S. surveillance for any security issues in the area. It is among a series of similar incidents involving the U.S. and other countries in recent months, as Beijing and Washington clash over their rival efforts to extend their influence in the region. The Defense Department disclosed the incident, together with the video, after it said that China had declined a meeting between Austin and Chinese National Defense Minister Li Shangfu at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a coming security forum in Singapore that both will attend. Secretary of State Antony Blinken similarly said Wednesday that it was “regrettable that the meeting that Secretary Austin sought did not go forward with his Chinese counterpart.” Speaking on a visit to Sweden, Blinken described the jet encounter as ""dangerous"" and said it underscored the need for the sides to talk. “The most dangerous thing is not to communicate as a result, to have a misunderstanding and miscommunication,” Blinken said. Beijing said this week that the U.S. was not matching its public rhetoric with action to mend ties. Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Tuesday reiterated Beijing’s opposition to the U.S. sanctions that Austin's counterpart has been under since 2018. “If the United States says it wants to communicate while suppressing and containing China by any means and imposing sanctions on Chinese officials, institutions and enterprises, what is the sincerity and meaning of such communication?” she said at a regular news briefing in Beijing. The Trump administration sanctioned Li, who was named Chinese defense minister in March, over his role in purchasing fighter jets and missiles from Russia. Mao said Wednesday that frequent U.S. naval and aerial surveillance in the region had long endangered China’s national security. “Such provocative and dangerous actions are the root cause of maritime security problems,” she said, adding that China will “continue to take necessary measures” to protect its sovereignty and security. China's military said the U.S. was to blame for the jet encounter, accusing the American plane of deliberately having entered its training zone and urging the U.S. to comply with rules. “The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Southern Theater organized an air force to monitor the entire process, disposing of it in accordance with the law and in a professional manner,” it said in an official announcement Wednesday. “The U.S. side’s action seriously undermines regional peace and stability.” President Joe Biden said recently that he was hopeful of a ""thaw very soon"" between the world's two largest economies. But before high-level diplomacy can move forward, there are a number of obstacles Beijing believes need to be addressed, a Chinese diplomat said. "
Australian veteran loses defamation case over reports of Afghan execution,Reuters,"June 1, 2023, 9:06 AM UTC",World,"SYDNEY — One of Australia’s most decorated soldiers lost a defamation lawsuit against three newspapers that accused him of involvement in the murder of six Afghans while on deployment, a stunning end to a case that lifted the veil of secrecy over the elite SAS. The newspapers proved four of the six murder allegations of which they accused former SAS Cpl. Ben Roberts-Smith, but “in light of my conclusions, each (defamation) proceeding must be dismissed,” Federal Court Judge Anthony Besanko said Thursday in a summary of his findings. Australian civil courts require a lower threshold to prove allegations than criminal courts do. Roberts-Smith has not been charged with any offenses. The ruling marks a win for media outlets seeking greater accountability for Australia’s military, typically bound by confidentiality. A 2020 report found credible evidence that members of Australia’s Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) killed dozens of unarmed prisoners in the lengthy Afghan war. Roberts-Smith, 44, was seen as a national hero after winning several top military honors, including the Victoria Cross, for his actions during six tours of Afghanistan from 2006 to 2012. He later carved out a post-military career as an in-demand public speaker and media executive. His portrait hangs in the Australian War Memorial. But articles by the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Canberra Times since 2018 suggested he went beyond the bounds of acceptable military engagement, including descriptions of brutal treatment of defenseless Afghan civilians. The articles, citing other soldiers who said they were there, said Roberts-Smith had shot dead an unarmed Afghan teenage spotter, and kicked a handcuffed man off a cliff before ordering him to be shot dead. Roberts-Smith sued the papers for portraying him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement.” He called the reports false and based on claims of failed soldiers who were jealous of his accolades and sought unspecified damages. The newspapers sought to defend their reports by proving the claims were true, and presented other soldiers and former soldiers as witnesses in court who corroborated them. The strategy largely worked. The papers had reported that Roberts-Smith pressured a lower-ranking Australian soldier to execute an elderly, unarmed Afghan to “blood the rookie,” said Judge Besanko, adding they proved that account true. In another case, the papers reported that Roberts-Smith murdered an Afghan man who had a prosthetic leg and was then “so callous and inhumane that he took the prosthetic leg back to Australia and encouraged his soldiers to use it as a novelty beer drinking vessel,” the judge said. He said the papers proved that allegation was also true. “It is a vindication for the many people in our newsrooms and our organization who supported this really important public interest journalism,” said James Chessell, managing editor of publishing at the newspapers’ owner, Nine Entertainment. “It is a vindication for the brave soldiers of the SAS who served their country with distinction and then had the courage to speak the truth about what happened,” Chessell said outside the court. Roberts-Smith’s lawyer Arthur Moses told reporters that “we will consider the lengthy judgment that his honor has delivered and look at issues relating to an appeal.” Roberts-Smith was not present in court. Besanko said he would give reasons for his decision on Monday after the federal government applied to delay the proceedings to give government lawyers time to check for national security information being inadvertently divulged.

Latvian Parliament elects first openly gay president of a Baltic nation,Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 5:31 PM UTC",OUT Politics and Policy,"HELSINKI — Latvian lawmakers on Wednesday picked the country’s long-serving popular foreign minister, a strong backer of Ukraine, as its new head of state in a tight vote. The 100-seat Saeima legislature elected Edgars Rinkēvičs, the country’s top diplomat since 2011, as president to serve for a four-year term. He received 52 votes, one vote more than required to win. Incumbent Egils Levits, Latvia’s head of state since 2019, didn’t seek re-election. Rinkēvičs, who announced in 2014 that he is “proudly” homosexual, will be the first openly gay president in the Baltic nations — all former Soviet republics where attitudes to sexual minorities have been less tolerant than in western Europe. His closest rival, businessman Uldis Pīlēns, got 25 votes in the third round of voting between the two remaining contenders after the third candidate, Elīna Pinto, had dropped out of the contest. After the vote, Rinkēvičs tweeted that he was “honored and humbled” by the Parliament’s decision and pledged “to serve the people of Latvia well.” Rinkēvičs, 49, served — among other posts — as a state secretary with the Defense Ministry and worked as a journalist with Latvian Radio in the 1990s. As foreign minister, he has enjoyed high popularity among Latvians because of his hard stance toward neighboring Russia and his unwavering support for Ukraine. In a news conference later Wednesday, Rinkēvičs urged countries to give Ukraine hopeful signals of a possibility of NATO membership in the military alliance’s upcoming summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in July. Levits had been expected to seek reelection. But in a surprise move announced earlier this month, Levits said he was disappointed that parties in Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš’ three-party coalition government hadn’t been able to agree on a joint candidate and said he wouldn’t run in such a situation. Latvia’s presidency is largely a ceremonial post and the head of state acts mainly as an opinion leader and uniting figure in the country where almost one-third of residents speak Russian. Rinkēvičs ran as the candidate of his and Kariņš’ New Unity party. A Baltic nation of 1.9 million, Latvia borders Russia to the east, Estonia to the north and Lithuania to the south. Latvia has been a member of NATO and the European Union since 2004. The country is home to a sizable ethnic Russian minority, many of whom are Russian citizens. Latvia regained its independence in 1991 following nearly 50 years of Soviet rule. The new president will be Latvia’s 11th head of state, counting from the country’s first independence declared in 1918. The president represents Latvia abroad, acts as the supreme commander of the armed forces, signs bills into law, nominates the prime minister and has the right to dissolve the Parliament, among other responsibilities. Rinkēvičs is due to be inaugurated on July 8. "
Drone attack brings Putin's war home to a shaken Moscow,Tatyana Chistikova,"May 31, 2023, 3:38 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"MOSCOW — The Kremlin’s war is no longer a distant concern for many Russians. For more than 15 months, the fighting has been focused on the battlefields and battered cities of Ukraine, while life continued largely as normal for millions across the border. But Tuesday’s drone assault — the first on civilian areas of Moscow since the war began — brought the reality of the conflict from the front lines to the Russian capital. While President Vladimir Putin and his officials sought to play down the attack, which caused minor damage, some Moscow residents told NBC News it had left them shaken and concerned that more may be on the horizon. Influential pro-war voices also renewed their criticism of the Kremlin, following a wave of incidents that have exposed the country’s defenses and signaled the war was increasingly being waged deep inside Russia. “I don’t feel safe,” said Anatoly, who did not want his last name used. The war has made gauging public opinion in Russia difficult, with many people afraid to speak their minds or reveal their last names, especially to the foreign media, amid a fierce crackdown on dissent and any criticism of what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Anatoly, 83, said he was not so sure about the effectiveness of the city’s air defenses, despite Putin’s praise for their work. “If they even flew to Red Square, then they will get here all the more,” he said, referring to the recent drone attack on the Kremlin itself. Moscow again blamed Kyiv for Tuesday’s incident, but Ukraine said it was not directly involved. The Russian Defense Ministry said eight drones were downed over the capital, with some residential buildings damaged and two people suffering minor injuries. Anatoly was speaking on Leninsky Prospekt, a street in a quiet and well-off neighborhood of southwest Moscow that he has called home for 40 years. He had not woken up before to a drone crashing into a neighbor’s balcony. But there was no sense of outward panic in the area. Children played in a playground and people enjoying the sunny weather stopped to peer at the building, which had a police cordon around it. Residents Marina, 38, and her 8-year-old son, Kolya, who have been living in the neighborhood for nearly a decade, said the incident gave them “unpleasant feelings.” “Everything is just beginning,” said Marina, who did not want her last name used out of fear of speaking out. “I don’t know who can have a sense of security right now.” Svetlana, 61, another resident who also feared giving her last name, said she was out for a morning walk with her dog when she saw emergency services arriving and assumed there was a fire. She then learned that a drone had hit one of the buildings in the neighborhood. “It was an unpleasant surprise,” she said. “A terrible nuisance. Tragic, one might say. You wouldn’t wish this on anyone, and what will happen next also nobody knows.” Russian officials and propagandists largely shrugged off the drone attack, with many of the most outspoken Kremlin hawks refraining from comment on social media for hours, rather than rushing to urge escalation in response. Some, like Margarita Simonyan, the head of the Russian state broadcaster RT, eventually waded in. “There is no panic,” she said on Telegram, adding that it was business as usual on the streets of central Moscow. But “it will happen again,” she warned, and the real question is how Moscow authorities will respond if many more drones are launched at the capital. Putin himself said in a brief statement much later Tuesday that the air defense work was satisfactory, and that there was an understanding of how to seal the capital’s skies going forward. But some of Russia’s influential military bloggers questioned the nothing-to-see-here narrative from the Kremlin, framing the drone attacks as part of a psychological warfare campaign by Ukraine meant to intimidate Russian civilians — one that might be working. “If the purpose of the raid was to stress the population, then the very fact of the appearance of Ukrainian drones in the sky over Moscow has already contributed to this,” the Telegram military channel Rybar, known for its pro-war position, wrote to its 1.1 million followers shortly after the attacks. The “inert reaction” of Putin and his officials creates the feeling that the Russian leadership does not understand the full danger of the situation in which the country finds itself, Tatiana Stanovaya, founder and head of the political analysis firm R.Politik and a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in her analysis. Putin is more concerned about stoking alarm that might force the Kremlin to respond with limited resources and options, she said, than he is of being undermined by an appearance of weakness. “No matter how daring the next Ukrainian attack is, Putin doesn’t think it can provoke dissatisfaction with the authorities in Russian society,” she added. Despite growing public criticism, some analysts agreed with that calculus and doubted the attack would have a serious impact on the Russian public’s support for Putin and the war. “The attack caused little damage, was irrelevant for most Russians, and is being finessed by the Russian media as another Ukrainian provocation in the face of Russian restraint,” said Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at King’s College London. “Single incidents such as this will not change Russian domestic politics appreciably,” he said. “What matters more are larger trends, such as the situation on the ground in Ukraine and the level of Russian military casualties.” Tatyana Chistikova reported from Moscow, and Yuliya Talmazan from London.

Sudan’s military says it has suspended its participation in talks with paramilitary rival,Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 2:34 PM UTC",World,"Sudan’s military suspended its participation in talks with a paramilitary force it’s been battling for weeks for control of the northeastern African country, a military spokesman said Wednesday. The development was a blow to the United States and Saudi Arabia, which have been mediating between the two sides. The conflict has plunged Sudan into chaos. Brig. Nabil Abdalla, a spokesman for the Sudanese armed forces, told The Associated Press that the move is a protest against the Rapid Support Forces’ “repeated violations” of the humanitarian cease-fire, including their continued occupation of hospitals and other civilian infrastructure in the capital, Khartoum. Sudan descended into chaos after fighting erupted in mid-April between the military, led by Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the RSF, commanded by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo. The fighting has killed at least 866 civilians and wounded thousands more, according to the Sudanese Doctors’ Syndicate, which tracks civilian casualties. The toll could be much higher, the medical group had previously said. Abdalla, the spokesman, said the military wants to ensure that the terms of a U.S.-Saudi-brokered truce “be fully implemented” before discussing further steps. He did not elaborate. On May 21, both sides signed a cease-fire agreement allowing for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the restoration of essential services destroyed in the clashes. They also agreed to stop the looting of residential properties and humanitarian aid, as well as the taking over of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals and power plants. There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia or the United States. So far, there have been seven declared cease-fires, all of which have been violated to some extent. Responding to the military’s move, the RSF said it “unconditionally backs the Saudi-U.S. initiative.” Two other senior military officials said the army sent a letter to the Saudi and American mediators detailing what they called the RSF violations. They said the military delegation was still in the venue of the talks in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah. One of the officials said the decision was prompted by the mediators’ efforts to move to the next stage of negotiations without “fully implementing the terms” of the humanitarian cease-fire. That stage includes a long-term cease-fire and engaging in negotiations to settle the disputes between the two sides, he said. Both senior officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media. On Tuesday, the military released footage that showed Burhan inspecting troops. The army chief warned that the military would resort to “full lethal force” if the RSF “doesn’t respond to the voice of reason.” The military’s aircrafts were also seen flying over the capital. Residents, meanwhile, reported clashes late Tuesday in parts of Khartoum and its neighboring city of Omdurman. Both sides traded blame for violating the cease-fire. The military’s move came two days after the sides agreed to extend the shaky cease-fire for five more days, after Washington and Riyadh signaled impatience with persistent truce violations. In a joint statement Sunday, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia called out both warring sides for specific breaches of a weeklong truce rather than issue another general appeal to respect agreements. The statement said the military continued to carry out airstrikes, while the RSF was still occupying people’s homes and seizing properties. Fuel, money, aid supplies and vehicles belonging to a humanitarian convoy were stolen, with theft occurring both in areas controlled by the military and by the RSF, it added. The fighting has caused widespread destruction in residential areas in Khartoum and its adjacent cities of Omdurman and Bahri. Residents reported storming and looting of their homes, mostly by the RSF. Many posted photos and videos of their looted homes on social media, condemning the pillaging. The conflict has also turned Khartoum and other urban areas into battlefields, forcing more than 1.65 million people to flee their homes to safer areas inside Sudan or cross into neighboring countries, according to U.N. figures released Wednesday. Early on, foreign governments raced to evacuate their diplomats and nationals as thousands of foreign residents scrambled to get out of the country. According to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration, around 425,500 people fleeing the conflict have crossed into neighboring countries. Egypt is hosting the largest number of refugees with more than 175,500, followed by Chad with around 114,700 and South Sudan with over 85,200, said the IOM. "
"China warns of artificial intelligence risks, calls for beefed-up national security measures",Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 2:14 PM UTC",World,"China’s ruling Communist Party has warned of the risks posed by advances in artificial intelligence while calling for heightened national security measures. The statement issued after a meeting Tuesday chaired by party leader and President Xi Jinping underscores the tension between the government’s determination to seize global leadership in cutting-edge technology and concerns about the possible social and political harms of such technologies. It also followed a warning by scientists and tech industry leaders in the U.S., including high-level executives at Microsoft and Google, about the perils that artificial intelligence poses to humankind. The meeting in Beijing discussed the need for “dedicated efforts to safeguard political security and improve the security governance of internet data and artificial intelligence,” the official Xinhua News Agency said. “It was stressed at the meeting that the complexity and severity of national security problems faced by our country have increased dramatically. The national security front must build up strategic self-confidence, have enough confidence to secure victory, and be keenly aware of its own strengths and advantages,” Xinhua said. “We must be prepared for worst-case and extreme scenarios, and be ready to withstand the major test of high winds, choppy waters and even dangerous storms,” it said. Xi, who is China’s head of state, commander of the military and chair of the party’s National Security Commission, called at the meeting for “staying keenly aware of the complicated and challenging circumstances facing national security.” China needs a “new pattern of development with a new security architecture,” Xinhua reported Xi as saying. China already dedicates vast resources to suppressing any perceived political threats to the party’s dominance, with spending on the police and security personnel exceeding that devoted to the military. While it relentlessly censors in-person protests and online criticism, citizens have continued to express dissatisfaction with policies, most recently the draconian lockdown measures enacted to combat the spread of COVID-19. China has been cracking down on its tech sector in an effort to reassert party control, but like other countries it is scrambling to find ways to regulate fast-developing AI technology. The most recent party meeting reinforced the need to “assess the potential risks, take precautions, safeguard the people’s interests and national security, and ensure the safety, reliability and ability to control AI,” the official newspaper Beijing Youth Daily reported Tuesday. Worries about artificial intelligence systems outsmarting humans and slipping out of control have intensified with the rise of a new generation of highly capable AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, and Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist known as the godfather of artificial intelligence, were among the hundreds of leading figures who signed the statement on Tuesday that was posted on the Center for AI Safety’s website. “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the statement said. More than 1,000 researchers and technologists, including Elon Musk, who is currently on a visit to China, had signed a much longer letter earlier this year calling for a six-month pause on AI development. The missive said AI poses “profound risks to society and humanity,” and some involved in the topic have proposed a United Nations treaty to regulate the technology. China warned as far back as 2018 of the need to regulate AI, but has nonetheless funded a vast expansion in the field as part of efforts to seize the high ground on cutting-edge technologies. A lack of privacy protections and strict party control over the legal system have also resulted in near-blanket use of facial, voice and even walking-gait recognition technology to identify and detain those seen as threatening, particularly political dissenters and religious minorities, especially Muslims. Members of the Uyghur and other mainly Muslim ethnic groups have been singled out for mass electronic monitoring and more than 1 million people have been detained in prison-like political re-education camps that China calls deradicalization and job training centers. AI’s risks are seen mainly in its ability to control robotic, self-governing weaponry, financial tools and computers governing power grids, health centers, transportation networks and other key infrastructure. China’s unbridled enthusiasm for new technology and willingness to tinker with imported or stolen research and to stifle inquiries into major events such as the COVID-19 outbreak heighten concerns over its use of AI. “China’s blithe attitude toward technological risk, the government’s reckless ambition, and Beijing’s crisis mismanagement are all on a collision course with the escalating dangers of AI,” technology and national security scholars Bill Drexel and Hannah Kelley wrote in an article published this week in the journal Foreign Affairs.

Air New Zealand is asking passengers to weigh in before international flights,Oliver Hu,"May 31, 2023, 10:19 AM UTC",World,"Add stepping on some scales to the preflight routine. New Zealand's national airline is asking passengers to weigh in after they check in for international flights from Auckland International Airport. Air New Zealand wants to weigh 10,000 passengers during the monthlong survey. The numbers won't be flashing up on scales for all to see, it promised, and they will remain anonymous even to staff members. It's all part of a requirement by the Civil Aviation Authority, the country's industry watchdog, to help calculate the weight and balance of planes before takeoff. “It’s a regulatory requirement for us to know the weight of everything that goes on the aircraft, and there’s a good reason for that,” said Alastair James, the airline’s load control improvement specialist. ""To fly safely and efficiently, we need to be able to calculate the weight and balance of the aircraft each and every time we fly,"" he said. James said passengers ""have nothing to worry about,"" adding: ""There’s no weight shown on the screen, anywhere. It’s just captured and goes straight into the computer."" They will also separately place their luggage on a scale for weighing. It is not the first time the airline has asked passengers to weigh in, with customers on domestic flights having been asked to do so a couple of years ago. While the survey has largely received support in New Zealand, some U.S. citizens expressed their concerns about privacy and body discrimination on social media. John Cox, NBC News' aviation expert, said the methods and data collected by Air New Zealand are important and could bring ""wide-ranging benefits"" to the world. ""Air New Zealand and the New Zealand regulators are in fact helping the industry. ... I think you may see some other airlines utilize this at some point in the future,"" he said. The airline said the survey began this week and will run through July 2. "
North Korea fails to launch spy satellite as rocket plunges into sea,Stella Kim,"May 31, 2023, 12:13 AM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 8:35 AM UTC",World,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Wednesday it failed to launch its first spy satellite into space, in a blow to the nuclear-armed state’s efforts to strengthen its military capabilities amid growing tensions with its neighbors and the United States. Pyongyang said it would soon try another launch after learning what went wrong to send the rocket plunging into the sea following liftoff. It was an unusually frank acknowledgment of failure by Kim Jong Un’s regime, but the attempted launch sparked alarm among  its neighbors, with rare emergency alerts and evacuation warnings rattling people in South Korea and Japan. The newly developed Chollima-1 rocket, which was carrying the Malligyong-1 spy satellite, was launched as scheduled at 6:27 a.m. local time (5:27 p.m. ET Tuesday) from the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground in the country’s northwest, according to the North Korean state news agency KCNA. It then fell into the sea off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula “after losing thrust due to the abnormal starting of the second-stage engine,” it said. North Korea’s National Aerospace Development Administration said it would investigate what happened and address any shortcomings before it carries out another launch as soon as possible, KCNA said. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was recovering potential wreckage from the vehicle from waters about 124 miles west of the South Korean island of Eocheong. Photos shared by the South Korean National Defense Ministry showed some of the debris that had been retrieved. In a trilateral phone call, the U.S., Japan and South Korea strongly condemned the launch, which was based on ballistic missile technology and violated United Nations Security Council resolutions. The three countries are closely monitoring the situation “with a high sense of alertness,” the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement summarizing the call. South Korea and Japan said they were monitoring for possible additional launches. In response to the launch, loudspeakers and text messages urged residents of South Korea’s capital, Seoul, to prepare to evacuate, but the country’s Interior and Safety Ministry later said that was an error. Jamie Park, 21, said her family woke up to emergency alerts on their phones, as well as announcements on public loudspeakers. “My mom told all of us to get dressed and gather all our important things like passports and laptops so that we can evacuate,” she told NBC News. The family spent about 40 minutes watching the news on television until they were sure the danger had passed. “I know not everyone took it seriously as it isn’t the most uncommon thing, but waking up to it suddenly definitely stirred things up,” Park said. Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon apologized for the confusion but said the alert had been sent out of an abundance of caution, noting that unlike on previous occasions, North Korea launched toward the south rather than the east. Japan also issued an emergency warning in the southern prefecture of Okinawa, but it was lifted later. North Korea said Tuesday that it planned to launch what it said was a military spy satellite between Wednesday and June 11, in part to monitor what KCNA called “the dangerous military acts of the U.S. and its vassal forces.” Last week, the U.S. and South Korean militaries held large-scale live-fire exercises near the border with North Korea, the first of five rounds between now and mid-June. North Korea views such exercises as a rehearsal for invasion, which the U.S. and South Korea deny. U.N. sanctions prohibit North Korea from conducting long-range and ballistic missile tests. The country has repeatedly launched such missiles anyway, including last month, when it said it tested a solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time. It has also conducted six nuclear tests and is thought to be preparing for a seventh. North Korea and South Korea remain technically in a state of conflict, after the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice rather than a peace treaty. South Korea, which successfully launched its first commercial-grade satellite last week, is expected to launch its own spy satellite later this year. North Korea’s launch failure “in no way weakens the justification for increasing trilateral cooperation among South Korea, Japan and the United States,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. But any attempt to toughen U.N. sanctions, he said, is likely to continue to be blocked by China and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, who view the sanctions as ineffective. In a statement, the U.S. National Security Council called on North Korea to return to negotiations on denuclearization, which have been stalled since early 2019. “The door has not closed on diplomacy but Pyongyang must immediately cease its provocative actions and instead choose engagement,” spokesperson Adam Hodge said. He said the U.S. would take “all necessary measures” to protect the American homeland, as well as its allies South Korea and Japan. Stella Kim reported from Seoul, Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jennifer Jett and Jimin Lee reported from Hong Kong. "
Indian official suspended after he drains reservoir to retrieve phone he dropped while taking a selfie,Lyme Cho,"May 31, 2023, 8:11 AM UTC",World,"A government official in central India has been suspended after he ordered the draining of more than 2 million liters (528,000 gallons) of water from a reservoir to retrieve a smartphone he dropped while snapping a selfie, according to official announcements and local media. Food inspector Rajesh Vishwas was on vacation near the Kherkatta dam in India's central state of Chhattisgarh when he dropped his Samsung phone into the reservoir May 21, The Indian Express newspaper reported. He was suspended for draining ""water from Paralkot reservoir located in Pakhanjur of Kanker,” according to Chhattisgarh's public relations office. “He has been suspended by Collector Dr. Priyanka Shukla with immediate effect due to his act contrary to the provisions of the Civil Services Rules, 1966.” The water — enough to irrigate at least 1,500 acres of land during India’s scorching summer — was drained over three days starting May 22, according to former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh. Vishwas defended himself in a video posted to the Indian Express website and said the issue had been ""exaggerated."" ""When I took it out, I took the water and put it back in the reservoir,"" Vishwas needed his phone back because it contained official departmental data, according to the Indian television network NDTV. He also said that he had received “oral permission” from R.C. Dhivar, a local Water Resources Department official, to drain 3 or 4 feet of water, he told the network. ""Permission to empty the water up to 5 feet was given orally,"" Dhivar told the Indian network ETV, ""but they had emptied the water up to 10 feet."" NBC reached out to Chhattisgarh's Controller Food and Drugs Administration for comment, but did not receive a response. The phone was eventually retrieved, but after three days in deep water, it was rendered unusable, according to the National News. Vishwas was widely criticized on social media for wasting water resources, especially as India grapples with climate change and heat waves. Singh, the former state chief minister, voiced his concerns on Twitter: ""Today in the scorching heat people are dependent on tankers, there is no arrangement for even drinking water,"" he wrote. ""Under the dictatorship by Dau (rich person) officials have considered the state as their own ancestral fiefdom,"" he wrote. "
"Chinese jet flew past nose of U.S. plane, Pentagon says",Courtney Kube,"May 30, 2023, 9:56 PM UTC",World,"A Chinese fighter jet flew directly in front of the nose of a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea on Saturday, the Defense Department said Tuesday, another in a rising number of incidents involving Chinese military aircraft and ships. The “unnecessarily aggressive maneuver” by the Chinese J-16 forced the U.S. RC-135 to fly through the fighter jet’s wake turbulence, according to the Pentagon, which released video of the encounter. The Pentagon said that the U.S. plane was “conducting safe and routine operations … in international airspace, in accordance with international law.” On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the ""Chinese pilot took dangerous action in approaching the plane very, very closely. There have been a series of these actions directed not just at us, but in other countries in recent months."" Late Monday, the Pentagon reported that China had rejected a U.S. request for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to meet with his Chinese counterpart in Singapore. The Pentagon had suggested a meeting between Austin and Li Shangfu on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security forum held from June 2 to June 4. Blinken said the Saturday incident ""underscores why it is so important that we have regular open lines of communication, including by the way between our defense ministers. It’s regrettable that the meeting that Secretary Austin sought did not go forward."" ""The most dangerous thing is not to communicate and as a result, to have a misunderstanding and miscommunication. And as we’ve said repeatedly while we have a real competition with China, we also make sure that doesn’t veer into into conflict and the most important starting point for that are regular lines of communication."" “We have seen an alarming increase in the number of risky aerial intercepts and confrontations at sea by PLA aircraft and vessels,” a senior Defense Department official said, using the initials for China’s People’s Liberation Army. “As leaders have said, actions such as these have the potential to create an unsafe incident or miscalculation.” A spokesperson for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said that U.S. concerns about the interaction “will be addressed through the appropriate, established diplomatic and military channels.” On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said frequent U.S. naval and aerial surveillance in the region had long endangered China’s national security. “Such provocative and dangerous actions are the root cause of maritime security problems,” she said at a regular news briefing in Beijing. Mao said China will “continue to take necessary measures” to protect its sovereignty and security. In February, a Chinese J-11 fighter jet appeared about 500 feet off the left wing of an American P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and remained for well over an hour. The U.S. plane was flying above mostly uninhabited islands that are claimed by both China and its neighbors. A voice from a Chinese military ground station warned the U.S. plane, “No approaching any more or you will pay full responsibility.” In December 2022, a Chinese plane passed within 10 feet of a U.S. aircraft. Two months ago, China’s military said that it had driven away the USS Milius after the U.S. guided missile destroyer “illegally intruded into China‘s Xisha territorial waters without the approval of the Chinese government.” The U.S. said the ship was conducting routine operations and was not expelled.

"Young Ontario couple shot dead by landlord over dispute, police say",Chantal Da Silva,"May 30, 2023, 10:23 AM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 7:32 PM UTC",World,"A young Canadian couple who were reportedly soon to be married were shot dead by their landlord  before the suspect barricaded himself in the house and died in a shootout with police, authorities said. Officers were initially called to a home in the Stoney Creek district of Hamilton, Ontario, about 42 miles from Toronto, around 5:40 p.m. Saturday over reports of gunshots, the Hamilton Police Service said in a news release. When they arrived, they found a 27-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man had been fatally shot, police said. Officers determined the two had been living at the home as tenants and had been shot in a ""landlord-tenant dispute,"" police said. ""The early indication on that is it sounds like there was some type of dispute regarding the state of the home,"" Det. Sgt. Steve Bereziuk told reporters, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The couple, an educational assistant and an electrician, were engaged, according to the broadcaster. Their identities have not been publicly released. Bereziuk said the pair were ""truly innocent victims."" The landlord, a 57-year-old man, barricaded himself inside the residence with firearms that were registered to him, Hamilton police said. An emergency response unit contained the area while negotiators tried to resolve the situation in what appears to have been an hourslong standoff. At one point during the negotiations, the suspect fired at a police armored vehicle before later firing additional rounds, which ""resulted in an interaction with police,"" authorities said. Ontario's Special Investigations Unit, which investigates the conduct of law enforcement officials involved in serious incidents, said the suspect was fatally shot during an exchange of gunfire with police. He was fatally shot around 10 p.m., just over four hours after officers initially responded, the unit said in a news release. The 57-year-old, who has not been identified, was pronounced dead at the scene, the unit said. Police said the victims' families had been notified and ""are extremely upset."" ""As you can well imagine, these are not people that this should happen to,"" Bereziuk said. ""They’re not involved in any level of criminality or lifestyle that may lead to an incident like this.""

Australian man frees his head from the jaws of a crocodile after he's attacked while snorkeling,Doha Madani,"May 30, 2023, 6:03 PM UTC",Animal News,"An Australian man suffered head injuries in a harrowing encounter with a crocodile in Queensland over the weekend. Marcus McGowan was snorkeling with his wife and friends off Cape York on Saturday when he was attacked from behind, he said in a statement released Tuesday by the Cairns and Hinterland health service. The crocodile, which McGowan believes was a juvenile, had its jaws around his head. ""I was able to lever its jaws open just far enough to get my head out,"" McGowan said. ""The crocodile then attempted to attack me a second time, but I managed to push it away with my right hand, which was then bitten by the croc."" McGowan was taken to Haggerstone Island, where a friend, a fireman, administered first aid until an emergency helicopter arrived to take him to a nearby hospital. He said he was treated for lacerations to his scalp and puncture wounds to his head and hand. Ultimately, McGowan said, he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""I live on the Gold Coast and am a keen surfer and diver, and understand that when you enter the marine environment, you are entering territory that belongs to potentially dangerous animals, such as sharks and crocodiles,"" he said in his statement. McGowan has asked for privacy as he recovers. Saltwater crocodiles, native to Australia, can grow up to 7 meters, more than 22 feet, according to the Australian Zoo. They can also hold their breath underwater for up to eight hours. ""They use the murkiness of the water to remain unseen before ambushing their prey, grabbing them with their powerful jaws and death-rolling them back into the water,"" the zoo said on its website. Though the population of saltwater crocodiles has rebounded after years of poaching, they are still considered vulnerable in Queensland, the zoo said. The last recorded attack by a crocodile was a nonfatal attack also around Cape York in February, according to the Queensland Department of Environment and Science. The department has a record of attacks from December 1985 through March, with the last recorded fatal attack in the state occurring in February 2021. ""The Queensland Government is committed to a crocodile management program that delivers appropriate protection of public safety while enabling the ongoing survival of estuarine crocodiles in the wild,"" the department said on its website.

Drones strike Moscow in first apparent attack on Russian capital’s residential areas since Ukraine war began,Yuliya Talmazan,"May 30, 2023, 7:37 AM UTC / Updated May 30, 2023, 4:13 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Drones hit Moscow on Tuesday morning in what appeared to be the first attack on residential areas of the Russian capital since the invasion of Ukraine. It comes weeks after an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin itself and after days of deadly Russian bombardment of civilians in Kyiv, as events far from the front lines take the spotlight ahead of Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive. Tuesday's incident damaged some buildings in Moscow and forced residents to evacuate homes, officials said, though the Kremlin largely shrugged off the dramatic display that its war was increasingly coming home. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the attack sought to intimidate the public, and he commended the work of the capital’s air defense. The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that eight uncrewed aerial vehicles were involved in the strikes. All drones were destroyed, three of them when they lost control after they were jammed and the five others when anti-aircraft systems shot them down, it added. The ministry blamed Ukraine for what it called a “terrorist attack.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview that his country ""has nothing directly to do"" with the drone attacks on Moscow but that it was ""pleased to observe and predict an increase in the number of attacks."" Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said drones had “caused minor damage to several buildings.” In a series of posts on the Telegram messaging app, he said that two people “sought medical attention” and that there were no serious injuries. He added that some residents were evacuated from some parts of the two affected buildings “for safety reasons” while emergency services were working on the scene. The regional governor, Andrei Vorobyov, said “several drones” were shot down as they approached the city. Photos and video shared on Russian social media appeared to show a drone flying over a town in the western Moscow region, as well as smoke and the sound of an explosion in a village in the same area. Russian authorities said an investigation had been launched. A spokesperson for President Joe Biden's National Security Council said: ""As a general matter, we do not support attacks inside of Russia. We have been focused on providing Ukraine with the equipment and training they need to retake their own sovereign territory, and that’s exactly what we’ve done."" The spokesperson noted that Tuesday was the 17th time this month that the Ukrainian capital had been hit by another Russian attack. Kyiv authorities reported strikes on several districts in the city, with one person reported killed and at least seven more people injured. Russia launched “several waves” of attacks with a combination of drones and missiles, officials said, after a rare daytime attack Monday that marked an intensifying assault on the city. Speaking on Ukrainian television Sunday, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said he had qualms about how people in Moscow ""rest"" while Russian forces brutalize Kyiv. But while Ukraine's capital has faced relentless bombardment, Tuesday's drone strikes were unprecedented for Moscow. Russia said four weeks ago that two drones targeted the Kremlin in what it called an attempt on Putin's life. Moscow blamed Kyiv for that alleged incident, as well, a charge Ukrainian officials denied. Putin framed the Moscow attack as a response from Ukraine after Kyiv suffered the largest drone attack since the start of the war Sunday, the day it marked the anniversary of its founding. In comments to the state news agency Tass nearly 10 hours after Tuesday's incident, Putin said Moscow's air defense systems had worked ""satisfactorily,"" although there was ""something to work on."" Still, he said, there was an understanding of how to seal any gaps. ""I am not so much worried about that as the attempts to get a response from Russia,"" Putin said. ""That appears to be the goal. They provoke a mirror response from us. We will see what we will do about that."" The war has been creeping deeper into Russia in recent months, with drone attacks on strategic sites and last week’s raid into the Belgorod region near the border, which was claimed by anti-Putin militias. Ukraine has frequently denied responsibility for the growing wave of attacks within Russia. “Today’s raid on Moscow somewhat equalized the situation between the capital and Belgorod,” Russian political analyst Abbas Gallyamov, a former Putin speechwriter, wrote on Telegram. “The inhabitants of the latter will not be so offended now, the population of the former will not care a little less.” Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin blamed his country's military leaders for allowing the drone attacks. In an expletive-ridden audio statement on his social media channels, he criticized the Russian Defense Ministry — the latest public rebuke for a ruling elite he recently warned could not only lose the war but also lead the nation toward a revolution similar to the events of 1917. “The fact that they are flying to Rublyovka, to your home, to hell with it! Let your houses burn,” he said, referring to an upscale area of Moscow popular with Russian oligarchs. “And what do ordinary people do when drones with explosives crash into their windows?” Russian authorities' rush to downplay the significance of the attack was ""striking,"" an analyst said. The system is fully directed at “self-praise for the sake of salvation” while expecting “patience” from the Russian people, the founder and head of the political analysis firm R.Politik, Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on Telegram. “That remains to be seen.” "

"Writer Gioconda Belli, stripped of citizenship by Nicaragua's government, wins poetry prize",Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 1:31 PM UTC",Latino,"MEXICO CITY — Nicaraguan poet and novelist Gioconda Belli, known for her feminist and erotic literature, was awarded the Reina Sofia Ibero-American Poetry prize Monday. Considered among Latin America’s best-known writers, Belli’s work has been translated into more than 20 languages and includes 15 poetry collections, eight novels, and seven books of essays, testimonials and children’s stories. The prize is considered the most important for Spanish and Portuguese poetry. Her first poems were published in the Managua newspaper La Prensa when she was 20 years old. Her first poetry collection, “Sobre la grama,” or On the Grass, was published in 1972. “I couldn’t be happier than to have won this poetry prize,” Belli said via Twitter Monday. “I celebrate the enriching of Nicaragua’s poetry tradition. I dedicate it to my Nicaragua, mother of my inspiration, sorrowful country of my hope. Long live poetry!!!” Belli was stripped of her Nicaraguan citizenship by the government of President Daniel Ortega and lives in Spain. Along with dozens of other prominent critics of Ortega’s regime, Belli saw her properties in Nicaragua seized by the government in February. Belli already had Italian citizenship, but also accepted citizenship from Chile. Ricardo Rivero, rector of Spain’s Salamanca University, which jointly awards the prize, said in a statement announcing the prize winner that beyond the quality Belli’s literature she has defended “values like the dignity of a person, the fight against tyranny and the maintaining of a coherent position at all times.” Ortega’s government has driven thousands of Nicaraguans out of the government since popular protests erupted in 2018 and expelled more than 200 prisoners considered by many to be victims of political persecution earlier this year, also stripping them of their citizenship.

"At least 150 people jailed under El Salvador's emergency powers have died, new report says",Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 1:24 PM UTC",Latino,"SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — At least 153 people jailed since El Salvador instituted emergency powers in March 2022 to confront the country’s powerful street gangs have died in state custody, according to a report released Monday by the human rights group Cristosal. None of those who died had been convicted of a crime they were accused of at the time of their arrest. There were four women among the victims and the rest were men. The deaths were the result of torture, and systematic and serious injuries, the report said. Nearly half of the victims suffered violent deaths. Some of the deaths showed signs they resulted from deliberate denial of medical assistance, medicine and food, including some deaths resulting from malnutrition. The deaths revealed punitive policies carried out by guards and prison officials. The report stated that such actions would have required authorization and backing by the highest level security officials. The government has not provided an official count of deaths among the incarcerated. The special powers approved by El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly in March 2022 following a surge in gang violence suspend some fundamental rights, such informing someone of their rights at the time of arrest and the reason for their, as well as having access to a lawyer. Cristosal said it compiled the information through field work, including at common graves, and collecting documents from medical examiners. Investigators also interviewed victims’ families and neighbors, as well as others who were jailed and later released. The organization called on the administration of President Nayib Bukele to answer about the conditions people are held under, respect due process, free the innocent, answer for those who have died, provide all available information to victims’ families and end the measures implemented under the special powers. Officially, the government has arrested more than 68,000 people under the special powers since March 2022. More than 5,000 people have been freed because they could not convince a judge they were tied to criminal structures, according to authorities. Other human rights groups and foreign governments have condemned the government’s actions and called for a lifting of what were supposed to be temporary measures. Bukele, however, maintains high levels of approval within El Salvador for his actions against the gangs. "
Uganda enacts harsh anti-LGBTQ law including death penalty,Reuters,"May 30, 2023, 12:37 PM UTC",OUT News,"KAMPALA, Uganda — Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni signed one of the world’s toughest anti-LGBTQ laws, including the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality,” drawing Western condemnation and risking sanctions from aid donors. Same-sex relations were already illegal in Uganda, as in more than 30 other African countries, but the new law goes further. It stipulates capital punishment for “serial offenders” against the law and transmission of a terminal illness like HIV/AIDS through gay sex. It also decrees a 20-year sentence for “promoting” homosexuality. “The Ugandan president has today legalized state-sponsored homophobia and transphobia,” said Clare Byarugaba, a Ugandan rights activist. President Joe Biden called the move “a tragic violation” of human rights and said Washington would evaluate the implications of the law “on all aspects of U.S. engagement with Uganda.” “We are considering additional steps, including the application of sanctions and restriction of entry into the United States against anyone involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption,” he said. A presidency photo of Museveni showed him signing the law with a golden pen at his desk. The 78-year-old has called homosexuality a “deviation from normal” and urged lawmakers to resist “imperialist” pressure. A local organization, Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum, and 10 other individuals later filed a complaint against the law at the constitutional court, one of the petitioners, Busingye Kabumba, told Reuters. Museveni had sent the original bill passed in March back, asking parliament to tone down some provisions. But his ultimate approval was not seen as in doubt in a conservative country where anti-LGBTQ attitudes have hardened in recent years, in part due to campaigning by Western evangelical church groups. Uganda receives billions of dollars in foreign aid each year and could now face adverse measures from donors and investors, as happened with a similar bill nine years ago. The bill’s sponsor, Asuman Basalirwa, told reporters that parliament speaker Anita Among’s U.S. visa was canceled after the law was signed. Among and the U.S. Embassy in Uganda did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a joint statement, the U.S.’s flagship HIV/AIDS program, PEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS said the law put Uganda’s anti-HIV fight “in grave jeopardy.” Dominic Arnall, chief executive of Open for Business, a coalition of companies that includes Google and Microsoft, said the group was deeply disappointed and the law ran counter to Ugandans’ economic interests. The U.N. human rights body declared itself “appalled.” Uganda’s move could encourage lawmakers in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania seeking similar measures. “What a leader we’ve in Africa!” tweeted George Kaluma, a Kenyan member of parliament who submitted an anti-LGBTQ bill in April. “Kenya is following you in this endeavour to save humanity.” The inclusion of the death penalty for offenses like transmitting HIV has drawn particular outrage internationally. Existing Ugandan law calls for a maximum 10-year sentence for intentionally transmitting HIV and does not apply when the person who contracted the infection was aware of their sexual partner’s HIV status. By contrast, the new law makes no distinction between intentional and unintentional transmission and contains no exception based on awareness of HIV status. The amended version of the bill, adopted earlier this month after Museveni returned it to parliament, stipulated that merely identifying as LGBTQ is not a crime and revised a measure that obliged people to report homosexual activity to only require reporting when a child is involved. LGBTQ Ugandans called those changes useless, saying law enforcement regularly exceeds its legal authorities to harass them. They said passage of the bill in March unleashed a wave of arrests, evictions and mob attacks. The issue has been a long-running one in Uganda. A less restrictive 2014 anti-LGBTQ law was struck down by a Ugandan court on procedural grounds, after Western governments had initially suspended some aid, imposed visa restrictions and curtailed security cooperation. In 2009, a bill dubbed “kill the gays” for initially proposing executing homosexuals was introduced after a conference in Kampala drew representatives from the United States including prominent anti-gay evangelical Scott Lively. As well as religious campaigning, Africa’s anti-LGBTQ attitudes also have their roots in the colonial era, including an anti-sodomy section of Britain’s penal code. By the time the UK legalized same-sex acts in 1967, many former colonies were independent and did not inherit the legal change. “To reduce any kind of human being, irrespective of their sexuality, to a death sentence based on who they identify as and how they choose to live their lives is something that we should all feel very ashamed about as a continent,” said South African filmmaker Lerato. “We can liken this to apartheid if not worse.” "
"Elon Musk meets Chinese foreign minister, who calls for ‘mutual respect’ in U.S. relations",Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 12:35 PM UTC",World,"China’s foreign minister met Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday and said strained U.S.-Chinese relations require “mutual respect,” while delivering a message of reassurance that foreign companies are welcome. U.S.-Chinese relations are especially tense after Washington shot down a Chinese balloon believed to be gathering intelligence and warned Beijing against supplying arms to Russia for its war against Ukraine. China has rejected a request for its defense minister to meet the U.S. defense secretary when both are in Singapore this weekend, the Pentagon said Monday. “We need to keep the steering wheel in the right direction of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation,” Qin Gang told Musk, according to a ministry statement. The two sides should “avoid ‘dangerous driving,’ ” Qin said. He gave no details of steps to improve relations. Musk’s visit comes at a time when the ruling Communist Party is trying to revive investor interest in China’s slowing economy. Foreign companies are uneasy following raids on consulting firms and given the strained Chinese relations with Washington. Qin said China will “unswervingly promote high-level opening up” and create a “market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment,” according to the statement. “China’s development is an opportunity for the world.” China’s electric vehicle market “has broad prospects for development,” the ministry quoted Qin as saying. China accounts for half of global electric vehicle sales and is the site of Tesla’s first factory outside the United States. Tesla opened the first wholly foreign-owned auto factory in China in 2019 after Beijing eased ownership restrictions to increase competition and speed up industry development. The Chinese statement cited Musk as saying Tesla was willing to expand its business in China and “opposes decoupling,” a reference to fears the world may split into multiple markets with incompatible products. Tesla didn’t respond to requests by email for information about Musk’s visit to China. "
North Korea says it will launch its first military spy satellite in June,Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 11:24 AM UTC",World,"North Korea said Tuesday it would launch its first military spy satellite in June and described space-based reconnaissance as crucial for monitoring the United States’ “reckless” military exercises with South Korea. The statement came a day after North Korea notified Japan’s coast guard that the launch, sometime between May 31 and June 11, might affect waters in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea and east of the Philippines’ Luzon Island. Japan’s defense minister warned its forces to shoot down the satellite or debris, if any entered Japanese territory, and its coast guard issued a safety warning for ships that would be in the affected seas during the expected launch, citing a risk of falling debris. While North Korea’s rivals have condemned the country’s planned launch as a banned test of ballistic missile technology, it’s less clear whether the satellite itself is advanced enough to support the North’s stated goals of tracking and monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities in real time. The pace of both North Korea’s weapons testing and the U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises increased in past months in a cycle of tit-for-tat. In comments published by North Korean state media, senior military official Ri Pyong Chol criticized the combined U.S.-South Korean military exercises, which Pyongyang has long described as invasion rehearsals. He said North Korea considers space-based reconnaissance “indispensable” to monitor the military exercises. Last week, the South Korean and U.S. militaries conducted large-scale live-fire drills near the border with North Korea — the first of five rounds of exercises marking 70 years since the establishment of their alliance. Washington and Seoul describe their regular military exercises as defensive and have expanded their training since 2022 to cope with the North’s evolving threats. Ri said the expanding U.S.-South Korean drills and other military activities underline their “sinister intention” to prepare for preemptive military action against North Korea. He said the “dangerous military acts by the U.S.” and its forces created a concerning security environment that makes it necessary for Pyongyang to gather real-time, reliable information on military movements in the region. South Korea has warned that North Korea will face consequences if it goes ahead with the satellite launch in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which ban the North from conducting any launch using ballistic technology. Space-launch vehicles for satellites share core technologies with long-range missiles that are built to deliver warheads aimed at destroying intercontinental targets. “It’s absurd to use our legitimate joint exercises, and the maintenance of the South Korea-US joint defense posture to respond to advancing North Korean nuclear and missile threats, as an excuse to launch a reconnaissance satellite,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lim Soo-suk said during a briefing. “We strongly urge North Korea to immediately cancel its launch plans.” Last week, South Korea launched its first commercial-grade satellite, which experts say could provide Seoul with key technology and expertise to place its first military spy satellite into orbit later this year and build more powerful missiles.

Japan premier’s son to resign after public outrage over private party at official residence,The Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 11:09 AM UTC",World,"Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Monday his son is resigning as his executive policy secretary to take responsibility for using the prime minister’s residence for a private party at which the merrymaking was exposed in magazine photos that set off public outrage. Shotaro Kishida, his father’s executive secretary for political affairs and eldest son, invited a group of people including relatives to a year-end party on Dec. 30 at the Prime Minister’s Official Residence. Photos published by the weekly Shukan Bunshun magazine showed Kishida’s son and his relatives posing on red-carpeted stairs in an imitation of the group photos taken of newly appointed Cabinets, with the younger Kishida at the center — the position reserved for the prime minister. Other photos showed guests standing at a podium as if holding a news conference. “As secretary for (the prime minister’s) political affairs, a public position, his actions were inappropriate and I decided to replace him to have him take responsibility,” Kishida told reporters Monday night. He said his son will be replaced with another secretary, Takayoshi Yamamoto, on Thursday. Kishida acknowledged that he had briefly greeted the guests but said he didn’t stay at the dinner party. He said he severely reprimanded his son for the party, but that failed to quell ongoing criticism from opposition lawmakers and public outrage which have pushed down his support ratings. Kishida appointed his son as policy secretary, one of eight secretary posts for the prime minister, in October. The appointment, seen as a step in grooming him as his heir, was criticized as nepotism, which is common in Japanese politics, long dominated by hereditary lawmakers. His son was previously his father’s private secretary. It was not the first time Kishida’s son has come under fire for making use of his official position for private activities. He was reprimanded for using embassy cars for private sightseeing in Britain and Paris and for buying souvenirs for Cabinet members at a luxury department store in London when he accompanied his father on trips. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno earlier called the son’s party at the official residence “inappropriate” and promised to ensure proper management of the facility to prevent future misuse. The nearly 100-year-old building previously was the prime minister’s office and became the living quarters in 2005 when a new office was built. "
"China’s youth unemployment hits a record high, deepening its economic scars","Clement Tan, CNBC","May 30, 2023, 10:48 AM UTC",World,"As youth unemployment in China rises to a record high, college graduates are caught in a perfect storm — with some forced to take on low-paying jobs or settle for jobs below their skill levels. Official data shows urban unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds in China hit a record 20.4% in April, about four times the broader unemployment rate even as millions more college students are expected to graduate this year. “This college bubble is finally bursting,” said Yao Lu, a professor of sociology at Columbia University in New York. “The expansion of college education in the late 1990s created this huge influx of college graduates, but there is a misalignment between demand and supply of high-skilled workers. The economy hasn’t caught up.” The scourge of underemployment is another issue that Chinese youths and policymakers have to grapple with. In a paper Lu co-authored with Xiaogang Li, a professor at Xi’an Jiaotong University, the professors estimated at least another quarter of college graduates in China are underemployed, on top of the rising youth unemployment rate. “Increasingly, college graduates are taking up positions that are not commensurate with their training and credentials to avoid unemployment,” Lu told CNBC. Underemployment takes place when people settle for low-skilled or low-paying jobs, or sometimes part-time work, because they’re not able to find full-time jobs that match their skills. “These are the jobs that used to be mainly occupied by the non-college educated,” Lu added. The scarring effects of graduating at a difficult economic time have been well documented in other societies. Research from Stanford University shows college graduates who start their working lives during a recession or period of economic downturn earn less for at least 10 to 15 years than those who graduate during periods of prosperity. Data from China’s Bureau of Statistics shows that 6 million of the 96 million 16- to 24-year-olds in the urban labor force are currently unemployed. From this figure, Goldman Sachs estimates there are now 3 million more unemployed urban youths relative to the period before the Covid-19 pandemic. This is likely to make it more urgent for the Chinese government to act. “Diminished job prospects could inevitably fan dissatisfaction among the youths, and a perceived failure to ensure their material well-being could upset the social contract the Communist Party has with the people in China,” said Shehzad Qazi, managing director at China Beige Book. Given China’s aging and declining population will reduce its economically active population, the impact of youth unemployment and underemployment could “potentially have very negative ramifications for the economy,” Columbia’s Lu told CNBC. While China is not the only society in the world plagued by double-digit youth unemployment, few others are seeing the scale of China’s problem, according to statistics from the International Labor Organisation. The Chinese central government is very cognizant of this problem. In April, China’s State Council announced a 15-point plan aimed at matching jobs with young seekers more optimally. This includes support for skills training and traineeships, a pledge for a one-time expansion of hiring at state-owned enterprises and support for the entrepreneurial ambitions of college graduates and migrant workers. Addressing more fundamental mismatches is much tougher, analysts say. “In many societies, including China, there’s usually a disjuncture between the labor market and higher education institutions. They don’t necessarily talk to each other,” said Lu. “Universities have some sense of what the labor market situation is and what employers are looking for, but often times their understanding is outdated, and may be distorted from time to time.” There’s also a mismatch between changing expectations of young people who are more educated and an economy that is not keeping up with their aspirations. “Because of the rapid increase in education, both for men and women, these young people are not willing to go back to factory jobs anymore,” said Jean Yeung, a professor of sociology at the National University of Singapore. Even as youth unemployment rates climb, China projects nearly 30 million manufacturing jobs could go unfilled by 2025, according to the country’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. That’s nearly half of all the jobs in the sector, the ministry said. “But the plan was for China’s economy to transform from labor-intensive industry to more technological, with a strong service-oriented, knowledge economy,” Yeung added. Yet this transition seems to be half-hearted in China’s state-driven economy, according to Qazi. Economists say a thriving services-driven economy is predicated on support for the private sector. But the problem is that small- and medium-sized companies are not getting access to credit. “Until that happens, you’re not going to have services in the private sector really being able to absorb these young graduates who want to work in the new industries, the industries of the future, and then be able to have that massive economic transition,” said Qazi. “It’s all interconnected.” China’s “zero Covid” policy during the pandemic led to factory closures and a two-month lockdown in the financial capital of Shanghai last year, as the broader economy ground to a halt. Goldman Sachs says the slackening in the services sector at the start of the year, before China reopened, could have contributed to the current high youth unemployment rate. However, analysts from the U.S. investment bank estimate that China’s youth unemployment rate will likely peak in the summer months in July and August with the influx of fresh college graduates. Goldman Sachs economists say that getting young people back to work would help China’s economic recovery since it would restore the consumption power of the young, a demographic that typically accounts for almost 20% of consumption in China. Except the jobs may not match what they desire or are trained to do. “I think it’s ironic that nowadays, having a college degree is no longer sufficient to land a high-skilled job for most college graduates,” said Lu. “But at the same time, it’s becoming unnecessary because everyone else is getting it.” "
30 international peacekeepers injured in fierce clashes with ethnic Serbs in Kosovo,Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 9:26 AM UTC",World,"The NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, KFOR, on Tuesday raised the number of its troops injured in fierce clashes with ethnic Serbs to 30. The Serbs had tried to take over the offices of one of the municipalities in northern Kosovo where ethnic Albanian mayors took up their posts last week. A statement said that 11 Italian soldiers and 19 Hungarian ones “sustained multiple injuries, including fractures and burns from improvized explosive incendiary devices.” It added that three Hungarian soldiers were “wounded by the use of firearms,” but their injuries are not life-threatening. The Serbs clashed with NATO troops in the municipality of Zvecan, 28 miles north of the capital, Pristina. “Both parties need to take full responsibility for what happened and prevent any further escalation, rather than hide behind false narratives,” said KFOR commander Maj.-Gen. Angelo Michele Ristuccia. "
"China launches new crew for space station, with eye to putting astronauts on moon before 2030",The Associated Press,"May 30, 2023, 3:55 AM UTC",World,"BEIJING — China launched a new three-person crew for its orbiting space station on Tuesday, with an eye to putting astronauts on the moon before the end of the decade. The Shenzhou 16 spacecraft lifted off from the Jiuquan launch center on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northwestern China atop a Long March 2-F rocket just after 9:30 a.m. Tuesday (9:30 p.m. Monday ET). The crew, including China’s first civilian astronaut, will overlap briefly with three now aboard the Tiangong station, who will then return to Earth after completing their six-month mission. A third module was added to the station in November, and space program officials said Monday that they have plans to expand it, along with launching a crewed mission to the moon before 2030. China built its own space station after it was excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to U.S. concerns over the Chinese space programs’ intimate ties with the People’s Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party. China’s first manned space mission in 2003 made it the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space under its own resources. On this latest mission, payload expert Gui Haichao, a professor at Beijing’s top aerospace research institute, will join mission commander Maj. Gen. Jing Haipeng, who is making his fourth flight to space, and spacecraft engineer Zhu Yangzhu. The crew will stay aboard the station for around five months, during which they will conduct scientific experiments and regular maintenance. The mission comes against the background of a rivalry with the U.S. for reaching new milestones in space. That has been largely friendly, but also reflects their sharpening competition for leadership and influence in the technology, military and diplomatic fields. American spending, supply chains and capabilities are believed to give it a significant edge over China, at least for now. China has broken out in some areas, however, bringing samples back from the lunar surface for the first time in decades and landing a rover on the less explored far side of the moon. The U.S., meanwhile, aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. In addition to their lunar programs, the two countries have also separately landed rovers on Mars, and China plans to follow the U.S. in landing a spacecraft on an asteroid. "
Ex-El Salvador president sentenced to 14 years for negotiating with gangs,Associated Press,"May 29, 2023, 6:35 PM UTC",World,"A judge sentenced former El Salvador President Mauricio Funes to 14 years in prison Monday for negotiating with gangs during his administration. Funes’ trial began in April with the former leader living in Nicaragua. El Salvador changed its laws last year to allow trials in absentia. Prosecutors had accused Funes of illicit association and failure to perform his duties for the gang truce negotiated in 2012. Funes had denied negotiating with the gangs or giving their leaders any privileges. Funes’ former Security Minister Gen. David Munguía Payes was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his involvement in the negotiations. Funes’ sentence was the sum of eight years for illicit association and six years for failure to perform duties. Prosecutors say the gang negotiations were aimed at getting the country’s powerful street gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for benefits to the gangs’ imprisoned leaders. El Salvador has pursued Funes, 64, who governed from 2009 to 2014, for other alleged crimes in at least a half dozen cases. In 2015, El Salvador’s Supreme Court ruled that the gangs are terrorist organizations. Current President Nayib Bukele has been accused of engaging in the same kind of negotiations with the gangs. In December 2021, the U.S. Treasury said that Bukele’s government secretly negotiated a truce with leaders of the country’s powerful street gangs. Imprisoned gang leaders were allegedly given privileges in exchange for slowing down killings and for giving political support to Bukele’s party. Local news site El Faro had previously reported negotiations. Former Attorney General Raúl Melara had said at the time that he would investigate the allegations, but when Bukele’s party dominated mid-term elections and took control of Congress, the new lawmakers ousted Melara. The truce apparently broke down when the gangs killed 62 people in a single day in March 2022. Bukele responded by suspending some fundamental rights and waging an all-out war against the gangs that carries on today. "
Vatican chastises bishops who stoke division on social media,Reuters,"May 29, 2023, 5:19 PM UTC",Social Media,"The Vatican urged bishops and high-profile lay Catholic leaders on Monday to tone down their comments on social media, saying some were causing division and stoking polemics that harmed the entire Church. The appeal was part of a 20-page document by the Vatican’s communications department titled “Towards Full Presence. A Pastoral Reflection on Engagement with Social Media.” The document, addressed to all Catholics, warned of the dangers of fake news on social media and other forms of abuse that had turned people into commodities whose data is sold, often without their knowledge or consent. It condemned polarisation and extremism that had led to “digital tribalism” on social media, saying individuals were often locking themselves in silos of opinion that hindered dialogue and often led to violence, abuse and misinformation. “The Christian style should be reflective, not reactive, on social media. Therefore, we should all be careful not to fall into the digital traps hidden in content that is intentionally designed to sow conflict among users by causing outrage or emotional reactions,” the document said. “The problem of polemical and superficial, and thus divisive, communication is particularly worrying when it comes from Church leadership: bishops, pastors, and prominent lay leaders,” it said. A number of conservative Catholic bishops and high-profile commentators, particularly in the United States, have criticised Pope Francis on Twitter, with some having endorsed fierce, far-right video attacks on the pontiff. “Unfortunately, broken relationships, conflicts, and divisions are not foreign to the Church. For example, when groups that present themselves as ‘Catholic’ use their social media presence to foster division, they are not behaving like a Christian community should,” the document said. It said particular attention would have to be paid to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in coming years, urging Catholics to beware machines “that make our decisions for us”. In 2020, the Vatican joined forces with tech giants Microsoft and IBM to promote the ethical development of AI and call for regulation of intrusive technologies such as facial recognition. "
Blasts hit central Kyiv as Russia launches rare daytime attack,Daryna Mayer,"May 29, 2023, 2:25 PM UTC / Updated May 29, 2023, 5:13 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine — Air raid sirens wailed, residents rushed to bomb shelters, and explosions rocked buildings in Kyiv on Monday morning amid an intensifying Russian assault on Ukraine's capital. The wave of powerful explosions struck central Kyiv around 11:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET), shortly after an air alert sounded through the capital, leaving little time for residents to find safety. NBC News staffers in the city heard a series of loud blasts that hit one after another, rattling window glass in buildings in the center of the capital. Video shared by journalist Liz Cookman on Twitter showed children running through the street and screaming during the morning explosions. Debris that fell in the Podil district caused a small fire, she said. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, Valery Zaluzhny, said 11 land-based ballistic and cruise missiles were launched at the Kyiv region. All were shot down, he said. The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday its forces carried out a mass strike with “long-range precision-guided air-launched weapons” on Ukrainian airfields. It did not address the strikes on Kyiv directly. Debris from intercepted missiles fell in Kyiv’s central and northern districts, landing on roads and parks, the Kyiv military administration said. At least one civilian was injured, it added. The daytime attack intensified the sense of unease among residents, who are already under strain after weeks of nearly daily nighttime attacks by Russian drones and missiles. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that it was “another difficult night for the capital” but that nobody had been killed and that no buildings had been damaged or destroyed. Six hours earlier, air defenses brought down more than 40 targets as Russian forces bombarded Kyiv with a combination of drones and cruise missiles, said Serhii Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration. The Kyiv military administration said the daytime strike was the 16th attack on the capital this month. “After long, exclusively nighttime attacks, the enemy struck a peaceful city during the day, when most of the residents were at work and on the streets,” it said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Many took shelter in nearby subway stations. The central station, Palats Sportu, was crowded with residents looking for safety after the sirens began sounding, Kyiv resident Anastasiia Gherebetska said. Gherebetska, 33, and her daughter, Hanna, who turned 5 on Sunday, have been spending many nights at the station, hiding from nighttime attacks on the city. Hanna sleeps in her clothes and knows the drill for running toward their nearest subway station when the siren sounds, her mother said. But Monday's strike caught her off-guard, said Gherebetska, who works as a designer. “It’s really scary. It is a kind of animal fear,” she said, speaking on the phone from the capital. “My child is very afraid of loud sounds. She sees fear in our eyes, as well. She sometimes imagines sirens, too. ... And she always asks why they want to kill us. I have no answer for her.” Kyiv authorities said more than 41,000 people were taking refuge in the subways during the daytime shelling. On Sunday, the city suffered the largest drone attack since the start of the war, according to Ukrainian officials. A “record number” of 54 Iranian-made Shahed drones were launched at the city, the air force said as it prepared to mark the day of its founding. At least one person was killed, local officials said. The Kremlin’s strategy of long-range bombardment has brought many sleepless nights for Ukrainians. Over the winter, Russian forces aimed their missiles and drones at power plants and other infrastructure. The apparent goal was to weaken Ukraine’s resolve and compel the Ukrainian government to negotiate peace on Moscow’s terms, but Ukrainians swiftly and defiantly repaired the damage. In recent months, Ukraine has been receiving advanced air defense systems from its Western allies, improving its ability to fend off bombardments by the Kremlin’s forces. Also Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared a message honoring Memorial Day in the U.S., saying: “It is our duty to remember what price was paid to give the light of freedom, despite all dark times that came down. “We Ukrainians will always be grateful to the U.S. and every American for extraordinary support which helps us confine the Russian tyranny to the losers, those who lost to the freedom,"" he said. ""My special gratitude on this Memorial Day goes to all Americans of different types, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, who became the warriors and whose threads turned into the threads of freedom and who were destined to show to the world that freedom will always shine bright on the hill.” “Let our victory of the Ukrainian warriors make this light shine brighter. God bless America. Slava Ukraini,” he concluded. Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv and Yuliya Talmazan from London. "
"China plans to land astronauts on moon before 2030, expand space station, bring on foreign partners",Associated Press,"May 29, 2023, 1:52 PM UTC",Space,"BEIJING — China’s burgeoning space program plans to place astronauts on the moon before 2030 and expand the country’s orbiting space station, officials said Monday. Monday’s announcement comes amid against the background of a rivalry with the U.S. for reaching new milestones in outer space, reflecting their competition for influence on global events. That has conjured up memories of the space race between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s, although American spending, supply chains and capabilities are believed to give it a significant edge over China, at least for the present. The U.S. aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. The deputy director of China’s space agency confirmed the twin objectives at a news conference but gave no specific dates. The agency also introduced three astronauts who will head to the country’s space station in a launch scheduled for Tuesday morning. They’ll replace a crew that’s been on the orbiting station for six months. China is first preparing for a “short stay on the lunar surface and human-robotic joint exploration,” Deputy Director of the Chinese Manned Space Agency Lin Xiqiang told reporters at the rare briefing by the military-run program. “We have a complete near-Earth human space station and human round-trip transportation system,” complemented by a process for selecting, training and supporting new astronauts, he said. A schedule of two crewed missions a year is “sufficient for carrying out our objectives,” Lin said. The Tiangong space station was said to have been finished in November when the third section was added. A fourth module will be launched “at an appropriate time to advance support for scientific experiments and provide the crew with improved working and living conditions,” Lin said. The trio being launched aboard the Shenzhou 16 craft will overlap briefly with the three astronauts who have lived on the station for the previous six months conducting experiments and assembling equipment inside and outside the vehicle. The fresh crew includes a civilian for the first time. All previous crew members have been in the People’s Liberation Army, the military wing of the country’s ruling Communist Party. Gui Haichao, a professor at Beijing’s top aerospace research institute, will join mission commander Jing Haipeng and spacecraft engineer Zhu Yangzhu as the payload expert. Speaking to media at the launch site outside the northwestern city of Jiuquan, Jing said the mission marked “a new stage of application and development,” in China’s space program. “We firmly believe that the spring of China’s space science has arrived, and we have the determination, confidence, and ability to resolutely complete the mission,” said Jing, a major general who has made three previous space flights. China’s first manned space mission in 2003 made it the third country after the USSR and the U.S. to put a person into space. China built its own space station after it was excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese space programs’ intimate ties to the PLA. Space is increasingly seen as a new area of competition between China and the United States — the world’s two largest economies and rivals for diplomatic and military influence — one a highly centralized, one party state, the other a democracy where the partisan divide largely evaporates over the issues of relations with China and space exploration. The astronauts NASA sends to the moon by the end of 2025 will aim for the south pole where permanently shadowed craters are believed to be packed with frozen water. Plans for permanent crewed bases on the moon are also being considered by both countries, raising questions about rights and interests on the lunar surface. U.S. law tightly restricts cooperation between the two countries’ space programs and while China says it welcomes foreign collaborations, those have thus far been limited to scientific research. Speaking Monday afternoon in Jiuquan, the technology director of the Chinese crewed space flight agency, Li Yingliang, said China hoped for more international collaboration, including with the U.S. “Our country’s consistent stance is that as long as the goal is to utilize space for peaceful purposes, we are willing to cooperate and communicate with any country or aerospace organization,” Li said. “Personally, I regret that the U.S. Congress has relevant motions banning cooperation in aerospace between the U.S. and China. I very much regret that personally,” he said. In addition to their lunar programs, the U.S. and China have also landed rovers on Mars and Beijing plans to follow the U.S. in landing a spacecraft on an asteroid. Other countries and organizations ranging from the India and the United Arab Emirates to Israel and the European Union are also planning lunar missions. The U.S. sent six crewed missions to the moon between 1969 and 1972, three of which involved the use of a drivable lunar rover that China says it is now developing with tenders in the private sector. While America currently operates more spaceports and has a far wider network of international and commercial partners than China, the Chinese program has proceeded in a steady and cautious manner reflecting the county’s vast increase in economic power and global influence since the 1980s.

Japan on standby for falling missile debris as North Korea announces plans to launch satellite,The Associated Press,"May 29, 2023, 12:13 PM UTC",World,"TOKYO — North Korea on Monday notified neighboring Japan that it plans to launch a satellite in coming days, which may be an attempt to put Pyongyang’s first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit. Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said he ordered Japan’s Self Defense Force to shoot down the satellite or debris, if any entered Japanese territory. Japan’s coast guard said the notice it received from North Korean waterway authorities said the launch window was from May 31 to June 11, and that the launch may affect waters in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea and east of the Philippines’ Luzon Island. The coast guard issued a safety warning for ships in the area on those dates because of the possible risks from falling debris. Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia, which is likely the reason it was the recipient of North Korea’s notice. To launch a satellite into space, North Korea would have to use long-range missile technology banned by U.N. Security Council resolutions. Its past launches of Earth observation satellites were seen as disguised missile tests. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the launch would violate U.N. resolutions and was a “threat to the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community.” Japan has already been on standby for falling missile debris from North Korean launches earlier this year and has deployed missile defense systems such as land-to-air PAC-3 and ship-to-air SM-3 interceptors in southwestern Japan and in the East China Sea. Matsuno said it was possible the satellite would enter or pass above Japan’s southwestern islands including Okinawa, where the United States has major military bases and thousands of troops. South Korea warned Monday that North Korea will face consequences if it goes ahead with its launch plan in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban the North from conducting any launch using ballistic technology. “Our government strongly warns North Korea against a provocation that threatens peace in the region and urges it to withdraw its illegal launch plan immediately,” a ministry statement said. It said South Korea will cooperate with the international community to resolutely cope with any North Korean provocation. Earlier this month, North Korean state media reported leader Kim Jong Un had inspected a finished military spy satellite at his country’s aerospace center and approved the satellite’s launch plan. Monday’s launch notice did not specify the type of satellite. Last week, rival South Korea launched its first commercial-grade satellite into space, which likely will provide it with technology and expertise to place its first military spy satellite into orbit later this year and build more powerful missiles. Experts say Kim would want his country to launch a spy satellite before South Korea does. North Korea placed Earth observation satellites in orbit in 2012 and 2016. Pyongyang does not notify neighboring countries of its missile firings in advance, but has issued notices ahead of satellite launches. While North Korea has demonstrated an ability to deliver a satellite into space, there are questions about the satellite’s capability. Foreign experts say the earlier satellites never transmitted imagery back to North Korea, and analysts say the new device displayed in state media appeared too small and crudely designed to support high-resolution imagery. Spy satellites are among an array of high-tech weapons systems Kim has publicly vowed to develop. Other weapons systems on his wish list include solid-propellant ICBMs, nuclear-powered submarines, hypersonic missiles and multi-warhead missiles. The North’s satellite launch plan comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. "
"‘Nuclear weapons for everyone’ who joins Belarus and Russia, Putin ally promises",Yuliya Talmazan,"May 29, 2023, 11:20 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, promised nuclear weapons to any nation that joined Russia and Belarus. The comment came just days after the Belarusian leader confirmed the transfer of Russian nuclear weapons to his country. Putin has periodically hinted at a nuclear escalation since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, dramatically increasing tensions with the U.S. and the West. “It’s very simple. You have to join the union between Belarus and Russia, and that’s it: There will be nuclear weapons for everyone,”  Lukashenko said in a comment aired Sunday night on Russian state TV. “I think it’s possible,” Lukashenko added, saying that he was expressing his own view. “We need to strategically understand that we have a unique chance to unite.” Lukashenko, who is one of Putin's staunchest supporters, made the comment in response to earlier remarks by Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the president of Kazakhstan, during a summit in Moscow on Wednesday. Tokayev said at the forum of the Eurasian Economic Union that Belarus and Russia enjoy a close relationship where “even nuclear weapons are shared between the two.” The Union State between Russia and Belarus was formed in 1999 and allows the two former Soviet republics to integrate economically, politically and militarily. On Thursday, the Belarusian leader confirmed that Russia has moved on the plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, first announced in March. It comes amid escalating nuclear rhetoric from Putin as his war effort in Ukraine flounders. Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, which Putin said it will not hesitate to use if the country’s security or existence is threatened. Belarus, which does not possess its own nuclear weapons after it transferred the stock it inherited from the Soviet era to Russia in the 1990s, is not officially a party to the war in Ukraine, although Moscow used its territory to launch the full-scale invasion last year. Putin propped up Lukashenko’s authoritarian regime after violent protests nearly toppled “Europe’s last dictator” in 2020, deepening the country’s political and economic reliance on Russia. In March, the Russian leader announced his plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, on Lukashenko’s request, drawing condemnation from the West. Lukashenko confirmed that the movement of nuclear weapons had already begun on Thursday, without clarifying if they had already reached Belarusian soil, according to Belarusian state news agency Belta. Meanwhile, defense ministers of the two countries, Sergei Shoigu and Viktor Khrenin, signed documents in Minsk last week, defining the procedure for keeping Russian nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Moscow has already handed over to Minsk the “Iskander” missile system, which can carry nuclear weapons, Shoigu said, and has assisted in converting some Belarusian aircraft for the possible nuclear weapon use. The State Department denounced the alleged deployment Thursday, calling it ""the latest example of irresponsible behavior"" by Russia. "
Venice police investigating after famed Grand Canal turns bright green,The Associated Press,"May 29, 2023, 7:15 AM UTC",World,"MILAN — Police in Venice are investigating the source of a phosphorescent green liquid patch that appeared Sunday in the city’s famed Grand Canal. The governor of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, posted a photo of the green liquid that spread through the water near the arched Rialto Bridge. The patch was initially reported by residents. Images on social media show a bright patch of green in the canal along an embankment lined with restaurants.

President Recep Erdoğan re-elected for unprecedented third term as Turkey’s president,Neyran Elden,"May 28, 2023, 3:19 PM UTC / Updated May 28, 2023, 5:31 PM UTC",World,"ISTANBUL — Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Sunday won re-election, surviving the toughest test of his two-decade and increasingly hardline rule. The news was greeted by a slew of international congratulations. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the victory was the result of  Erdoğan's work supporting Turkey's  ""sovereignty and pursue an independent foreign policy.” Although Turkey is a NATO ally, under Erdoğan, 69, the country of 84 million has grown closer to Russia and slipped further toward authoritarianism. The results will have ramifications outside Turkey, which enjoys a strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. The Turkish Supreme Election Council officially declared Erdoğan the winner of Sunday’s presidential runoff against Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. Soon after the results were announced Fellow hardliner, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, also congratulated Erdoğan for an “unquestionable election victory.” "
South Africa to investigate U.S. allegation of arms shipment to Russia,Reuters,"May 28, 2023, 2:32 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed a panel to investigate U.S. allegations that a Russian ship had collected weapons from a naval base near Cape Town last year, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday. The U.S. ambassador to South Africa, Reuben Brigety, said on May 11 that he was confident that a Russian ship, which docked at a naval base in Simonstown in the Western Cape in December last year, took aboard weapons from South Africa, an allegation South Africa has since denied. The allegations have caused a diplomatic row among the U.S., South Africa and Russia and called into question South Africa’s non-aligned position on the Ukraine conflict. South Africa says it is impartial and has abstained from voting on U.N. resolutions on the war. “The President decided to establish the enquiry because of the seriousness of the allegations, the extent of public interest and the impact of this matter on South Africa’s international relations,” said the statement. The three-member panel will be chaired by Phineas Mojapelo, former deputy judge president of Gauteng province. The other two members are Advocate Leah Gcabashe, who was evidence leader for a state corruption inquiry that ended last year, and Enver Surty, former deputy minister of basic education. It will have six weeks to conduct its investigation. The terms of reference for the panel include establishing who was aware of the cargo ship’s arrival, the contents that were loaded and off-loaded and “whether constitutional, legal or other obligations were complied with in relation to the cargo ship’s arrival.” The president is expected to receive a final report within two weeks of the investigation concluding.

Man faces up to 10 years in prison after arrest for opening plane emergency exit door,Associated Press,"May 28, 2023, 1:26 PM UTC",World,"A man who opened an emergency exit door during a flight in South Korea was formally arrested Sunday and faces up to 10 years in prison on a charge of violating the aviation security law, officials said. During a preliminary questioning, the 33-year-old told investigators that he felt suffocated and tried to get off the plane quickly, according to police. Twelve people were slightly injured on Friday after he opened the door of the Asiana Airlines Airbus A321-200, causing air to blast inside the cabin and terrifying passengers. Some testified they suffered severe ear pain and saw others screaming and crying. A video shared on social media shows passengers’ hair being whipped by air blowing into the cabin. Normally, the emergency exit doors cannot be opened mid-flight due to the difference in air pressure inside and outside of the aircraft. But during Friday’s incident, the man succeeded in opening the door likely because the plane was flying at a low altitude while preparing to land and there wasn’t much difference in pressure, according to Asiana Airlines officials. The Transport Ministry said the plane was at 700 feet when the man pulled the door open. The plane was preparing to land in Daegu on an hour-long flight from the southern island of Jeju with 200 people on board. They included teenage athletes on their way to a track and field competition, according to Asiana Airlines. On Sunday, a district court in Daegu approved a warrant to formally arrest the man. Police earlier sought the arrest warrant, citing the graveness of the crime and a possibility the man may flee, according to Daegu police. “I wanted to get off the plane soon,” the man, whose face was covered by a black hoodie, a cap and a mask, told reporters at the court ahead of its review of his arrest warrant. “I’m really sorry to kids,” he said, in a likely reference to the teenage athletes. Daegu police said they have up to 20 days to investigate the man before determining whether to send him to prosecutors for a possible indictment. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for breaching the aviation security law that bars passengers from handling entry doors, emergency exit doors and other equipment on board, according to the Transport Ministry. Daegu police said the man, surnamed Lee, told them that he was under stress after losing a job recently and that he wanted to get out of the plane soon because he was feeling suffocated just before landing. The people who were taken to hospitals were mainly treated for minor problems such as breathing difficulties. Asiana Airlines said in a statement that starting from Sunday, it stopped the sale of emergency exit seats on its 174-seat A321-200 planes and the 195-seat A321-200s as a safety precaution. Lee was seated near the emergency exit, airline officials said. "
Kyiv hit by massive Russian drone attack as city marks its founding,Leila Sackur,"May 28, 2023, 11:59 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Ahead of the anniversary of its founding in 482 A.D., Kyiv suffered the largest drone attack since the start of the war with Russia, Ukrainian officials said Sunday. Ukraine’s air force said in a statement on Telegram that a “record number” of 54 Russia-launched, Iranian-made “Shahed” drones were launched at the city overnight, although it added that it had shot down 52 of them. NBC News was not able to independently verify these figures. The attack was primarily directed at military facilities and critical infrastructure in the center of Ukraine, including Kyiv, the statement said. In a separate Telegram post, the Kyiv City Military Authority said the attack “was carried out in several waves, and the air alert lasted more than 5 hours.” It added that it was “the most massive drone attack on the capital since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, namely with the ‘Shahed’ barrage of ammunition.” Shahed drones are self-detonating aerial weapons in which the munition can loiter over a target until instructed to attack, destroying the weapon in the process. Iran is believed to have sent hundreds of these weapons to Russia since the beginning of its invasion last February. At least one person was killed and another was taken to hospital after being hit by falling debris from buildings that were struck, the military authority said. A shopping mall and a three-story warehouse also caught fire as a result of the debris, causing 10,800 square feet of destruction, it added. Vitali Klitchko, Kyiv's mayor, also said on Telegram that buildings had caught fire in the historic neighborhood of Perchersk in the city center, which is famous for its monastery containing the relics of saints. Bolstered by sophisticated Western-supplied systems, Ukraine has been adept at thwarting Russian air attacks — both drones and aircraft missiles. Earlier in May, Ukraine prevented an intense Russian air attack on Kyiv, shooting down all missiles aimed at the capital. The most recent attacks came as Kyiv prepared to mark the anniversary of the city’s official founding. The day is usually celebrated with live concerts, street fairs, exhibitions and fireworks, but scaled-back festivities are planned for this year's anniversary celebration. “The history of Ukraine is a long-standing irritant for complex Russians,” said Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, said on Telegram on Sunday. “Ancient Kyiv, Ukrainian Kyiv … UAV attack.” The attack's came as speculation ratcheted up about a long-anticipated counteroffensive from Ukrainian forces. “We are preparing the battlefield for the new phase of the war. It’s going on now. It is a large number of measures in different sectors of the front line,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NBC News Saturday. Conceding that preparation was well underway, Podolyak also praised a slickly produced video posted on Telegram Saturday by Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces. It showed Ukrainian troops training, swearing an oath and preparing for battle, alongside the caption “The time has come to return what is ours.” If Ukraine’s top general is suggesting that, he’ll have a good reason, Podolyak said, adding that it showed “that Ukraine may be almost ready to start a big operation aimed at the liberation of its territories.” "
Erdoğan looks to extend his 20-year rule as Turkey votes in presidential runoff,Matt Bradley,"May 28, 2023, 10:22 AM UTC",World,"ANKARA, Turkey — It’s one of the most hotly contested presidential elections in recent times, but at the Arjantin İlkokulu elementary school in Turkey’s capital, Ankara, the mood was quiet, orderly and calm. There was no pushing and shoving as voters waited in short lines to decide whether the country’s longtime leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stretches his rule into a third decade or is unseated by challenger Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who has promised to restore a more democratic society. Continuity or change? “I hope it will be good for Turkey,” said geologist Salami Toprak, 67, shortly after he voted. “Let’s see what’s gonna come out.” He said that he was thinking about the next generation as he cast his ballot. Watched closely from Washington and Kyiv to Moscow and Beijing, the runoff in the Turkish Republic’s centenary year comes after neither candidate was able to secure more than 50% of the votes in the first ballot on May 14, with Erdoğan falling short by a minuscule amount. Kılıçdaroğlu, 74, has described the runoff as a referendum on the country’s future. The leader of the secular, center-left Republican People’s Party, or CHP, since 2010 is a starkly different figure from Erdoğan, who is known for his bombastic speeches. Soft-spoken, Kılıçdaroğlu has a reputation as a bridge builder. Along with returning the country to a parliamentary democracy, Kılıçdaroğlu and the alliance have promised to establish the independence of the judiciary and the central bank, institute checks and balances and reverse the democratic backsliding and crackdowns on free speech and dissent. But Erdoğan has been favored to win, especially after his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, retained a parliamentary majority in the elections earlier this month. Initially, however, he had trailed in opinion polls during a campaign dominated by the fallout from the devastating earthquake that left more than 50,000 dead earlier this year and the country’s economic turmoil. Erdoğan increased wages and pensions ahead of the election’s first round, and subsidized electricity costs and gas bills in an attempt to woo voters who have faced a steep cost-of-living and currency crisis precipitated by numerous rate cuts by the government in an attempt to boost exports. Immigration has also been high on the agenda, and both candidates have sought to bolster their nationalist credentials before the runoff. Ahead of the first vote, Kılıçdaroğlu said he intended to repatriate refugees within two years by creating favorable conditions for their return. But he has since toughened his stance and has vowed to send all refugees home once he's elected president. Erdoğan, meanwhile, courted and won the backing of the nationalist politician Sinan Ogan, the former academic who was backed for president by an anti-migrant party but was eliminated after finishing third in the first round of voting. On the campaign trail, Ogan said he would consider sending migrants back by force if necessary. While the economy and migration were important issues, “Erdoğan managed to securitize the elections and convinced his base that national security was at stake,” said Dimitar Bechev, a lecturer on Turkey at Oxford University and author of “Turkey Under Erdoğan.” He added that “identity politics revolving around ethnicity and religion” had determined much of the allocation of the votes. The results will also have myriad ramifications outside Turkey, which enjoys a strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Turkey boasts of having NATO’s second largest armed forces after the U.S. Controlling the crucial Bosporus Strait, Turkey is widely believed to host U.S. nuclear missiles on its soil. Despite being a NATO member, the country has maintained close ties with Russia and has blocked Sweden’s membership in the Western military alliance. An Erdoğan win would likely deepen the country’s relationship with Moscow, according to Nilgun Arisan Eralp, the director at the Center for E.U. studies at the Economic Policy Research Institute of Turkey in Ankara. “Given the dire straits the economy is in, Russian money will be needed for the regime to continue,” Eralp said, adding that it was likely he would continue to reject Swedish membership in NATO, damaging relations with the United States and drawing the country closer to the Kremlin. Ankara has long accused Sweden of harboring militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, which is a designated terrorist group in Turkey, Sweden and the United States. In Istanbul Emre Türkoğlu, 36, said he was waiting for the results with “enthusiasm.” “This is important to be here today,” said the travel agent. “But I think that there was no need for a second round because we all know that the president Erdoğan is going to win anyway. The past two weeks was an unclear period. I don’t like uncertainty in politics.” Matt Bradley and Paul Goldman reported from Ankara. Leila Sackur reported from London. "
Modi opponents boycott opening of new parliament building as PM reshapes India’s power corridor,Associated Press,"May 28, 2023, 7:55 AM UTC",World,"India’s major opposition parties Sunday boycotted the inauguration of a new parliament building by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a rare show of unity against his Hindu nationalist ruling party, which has spent nine years in power and is seeking a third term in general elections next year. Modi inaugurated the new parliament in the capital of New Delhi by offering prayers as Hindu priests chanted religious hymns at the start of the ceremony. Opposition parties criticized the event saying the prime minister had sidelined President Droupadi Murmu, who has only ceremonial powers but is the head of state and highest constitutional authority. “May this iconic building be a cradle of empowerment, igniting dreams and nurturing them into reality,” Modi tweeted shortly after the inauguration. Senior ministers from Modi’s party and leaders from its alliance partners attended the inauguration but at least 19 opposition parties skipped the event, which coincided with the birth anniversary of a Hindu nationalism ideologue. Opposition parties said in a statement Wednesday that Modi’s “decision to inaugurate the building by himself” was “a grave insult” to India’s democracy, adding that the ruling government had “disqualified, suspended and muted” opposition lawmakers while passing “controversial legislation” with little debate. “When the soul of democracy has been sucked out from the parliament, we find no value in a new building,” the parties said. India’s powerful home minister, Amit Shah, said the opposition had politicized the event and other leaders from Modi’s party said the boycott is “an insult to the prime minister.” The new triangular-shaped building — built at an estimated cost of $120 million — is part of a $2.8 billion revamp of British-era offices and residences in central New Delhi that will also include blocks of buildings to house government ministries and departments, and Modi’s new private residence. The entire project, called the “Central Vista,” is spread over 1.9 miles. The project was announced in 2019 and Modi laid its foundation a year later in December 2020. The plan has drawn intense criticism from opposition politicians, architects and heritage experts, many of whom have called it environmentally irresponsible, a threat to cultural heritage and too expensive. Outrage grew in 2021 when at least 12 opposition parties questioned the project’s timing, saying it was built as the country faced a devastating surge in coronavirus cases. They branded the revamp as Modi’s “vanity project” and said its construction was prioritized over the loss of lives and livelihoods during the pandemic. A year earlier, a group of 60 former civil servants wrote an open letter to Modi to highlight the architectural value of the old parliament building and said the new plan would “irrevocably” destroy the area’s cultural heritage. Modi’s government has said the revamp was necessary because the older building was “showing signs of distress and over utilization” and that the new design “combines the country’s heritage and traditions.” The newly inaugurated building sits just across from India’s old parliament, a circular structure designed by British architects in the early 20th century. The new four-story building has a total of 1,272 seats in two chambers, almost 500 more than the old building. During the televised ceremony Sunday, Modi prostrated before a royal golden scepter and later installed it near the chair of the speaker. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party has said the scepter symbolized the transfer of power when it was gifted to the country’s first prime minister on the eve of India’s independence from Britain in 1947. Modi’s critics and opposition leaders have questioned the scepter’s historicity and said the emblem is appropriate to a monarchy, not a democracy. Modi’s supporters see the new parliament as the prime minister’s attempt to remake India’s power corridor and disrupt the country’s colonial legacy. Last year, Modi inaugurated a revamped colonial avenue in the heart of New Delhi that is used for ceremonial military parades. The boulevard was earlier called “Rajpath,” or Kingsway, but Modi’s party changed it to “Kartavya Path,” or road to duty, arguing the old name was a “symbol of slavery” that had “been erased forever.” Many such moves by Modi’s ruling government have been met with strong criticism, but the controversy over the new parliament building has been the most fractious. It comes just months after opposition leaders protested Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s disqualification from Parliament in a defamation case over remarks he made about Modi’s surname. Hours before the new parliament was opened, the Congress party’s general secretary, Jairam Ramesh, criticized Modi again. “A self-glorifying authoritarian Prime Minister with utter disdain for Parliamentary procedures, who rarely attends Parliament or engages in it, inaugurates the New Parliament building in 2023,” he tweeted.

Man who opened emergency door on South Korea flight told police he felt suffocated,Associated Press,"May 27, 2023, 5:04 PM UTC",World,"SEOUL, South Korea — A passenger who opened an emergency exit door during a flight in South Korea told police that he felt suffocated and tried to get off the plane quickly as it approached landing, reports said Saturday. Twelve people were slightly injured when the man opened the door of the Asiana Airlines Airbus A321 on Friday, causing air to blast inside the cabin. The plane, which was flying to the city of Daegu from the southern island of Jeju, landed safely. The man was detained by police in Daegu for allegedly violating the aviation security law. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. The 33-year-old told police that he had wanted to get out of the plane because he was feeling suffocated, Yonhap news agency reported, citing police. Yonhap said the man told police he had suffered stress after losing his job recently. Other South Korean media carried similar stories on the man’s motive. The reports said Daegu police requested a warrant to formally arrest him. Calls to Daegu police were unanswered early Sunday. Reached by The Associated Press earlier, Daegu police officers refused to provide details about the man, citing privacy issues. The plane was carrying 194 people including teenage athletes on their way to a track and field competition. The man pulled the door open when the plane was reaching the Daegu airport at an altitude of 700 feet (213 meters). The people who were taken to hospitals were mainly treated for minor problems such as breathing difficulties. "
Ukraine prepares 'for a new phase of the war' as counteroffensive appears imminent,Molly Hunter,"May 27, 2023, 11:44 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine has entered “a new phase of the war,” a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday as speculation about its long-anticipated counteroffensive ratcheted up. “Now we see the intensifying attacks on the Russian rear supplies,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview, adding that preparations were taking place to strike back at the Kremlin's forces. “We are preparing the battlefield for the new phase of the war. It’s going on now. It is a large number of measures in different sectors of the front line,” he said, conceding that preparation was well underway. During the interview, Podolyak also praised a slickly produced video posted on Telegram on Saturday by Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces. It showed Ukrainian troops training, swearing an oath and preparing for battle, alongside the caption “The time has come to return what is ours.” Ukraine’s top general is suggesting that he’ll have a good reason, Podolyak said, calling it “very good.”  He added that it showed “that Ukraine maybe almost ready to start a big operation aimed at the liberation of its territories.” He tweeted the other day that the counteroffensive was “not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon.” Meanwhile, at the scene of some of the war’s heaviest fighting in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister said Saturday that Russian attacks had “decreased.” “Yesterday and today there are no active battles there — neither in the city, nor on the flanks,” Hanna Maliar said in a Telegram post.  “Instead, the enemy is actively shelling the outskirts of the city.” After an intense monthslong battle for the city that came to embody Ukrainian resistance, the Kremlin declared full control of the city last week after months of fighting not seen in Europe since World War II. But the celebrations were dismissed in Kyiv, where officials insisted that the city was not completely under Russian control and that the battle was far from over. Maliar said Saturday that Ukrainian troops  “firmly hold” the heights overlooking Bakhmut from the north and south, as well as a portion of the outskirts of the city, but had not advanced over the past two days to focus on “other tasks.” Russian forces had “made a bet on conducting air strikes and intensive artillery fire,” she said. “The decrease in the enemy’s offensive activity is due to the fact that troops are being replaced and regrouped,” she added. “The enemy is trying to strengthen its own capabilities.” Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, posted a video Saturday that he said depicted Ukrainian special forces operating inside the ruined city. NBC News has not been able to independently verify the video. Elsewhere, Britain’s Defense Ministry in its daily intelligence briefing Saturday, that forces from the Wagner mercenary group whose fighters led the costly Russian push for Bakhmut, had “likely started to withdraw” from some of their positions in the city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner’s millionaire owner with longtime links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Thursday that his forces had started pulling out and were handing over control to the Russian military. Prigozhin’s Bakhmut triumph delivered a badly needed victory for Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has lost momentum. Elsewhere, an attack by two drones caused an explosion in Russia’s Pskov region near the border with Belarus, local governor Mikhail Vedernikov said on Telegram on Saturday. An oil pipeline’s administrative building was damaged, he added. Vedernikov did not point the finger at Ukraine, but Moscow has previously blamed Kyiv for similar incidents. Molly Hunter reported from Kyiv and Leila Sackur from London. "
Serbian border troops on high alert after ethnic clashes inside Kosovo,Associated Press,"May 27, 2023, 8:30 AM UTC",World,"Serbian troops on the border with Kosovo were put on high alert Friday following clashes inside Kosovo between police and ethnic Serbs that injured more than a dozen people. Ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo, who are a majority in that part of the country, had tried to block recently-elected ethnic Albanian officials from entering municipal buildings earlier Friday. Last month’s snap election was largely boycotted by ethnic Serbs and only ethnic Albanian or other smaller minority representatives were elected in the mayoral posts and assemblies. Kosovo police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd and let the new officials into the offices. Several cars were set ablaze. Kosovo Serb hospital officials said about 10 protesters were injured. Police said five officers were injured as protesters hurled stun grenades and other objects. A police car was burned. In response to the clashes, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said he put the army on the “highest state of alert” and ordered an “urgent” movement of troops closer to the border. He also demanded that NATO-led troops stationed in Kosovo protect ethnic Serbs from the police. The United States condemned Kosovo’s government for using police to forcibly enter the municipal buildings. “These actions have sharply and unnecessarily escalated tensions, undermining our efforts to help normalize relations between Kosovo and Serbia and will have consequences for our bilateral relations with Kosovo,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday. Vucic spoke at a rally Friday evening in Belgrade as tens of thousands of people turned out to support the government in the wake of two mass shootings earlier this month that killed 18 people and wounded 20 others, stunning the nation. “We will preserve peace — but I am telling you that Serbia won’t sit idle the moment Serbs in northern Kosovo are attacked,” he told the crowd. Vucic has previously warned that Belgrade would respond to violence against Serbs, and has stepped up combat readiness several times during moments of tension with Kosovo. However, any attempt by Serbia to send its troops over the border would mean a clash with NATO troops stationed there. Zdravko Ponos, a former Serbian army chief turned opposition politician, criticized Vucic’s response as “inappropriate.” “This is only saber-rattling that serves as face-saving for Vucic,” Ponos told the N1 regional television network. Kosovo police acknowledged their increased presence “to assist mayors of the northern communes of Zvecan, Leposavic and Zubin Potok to exert their right of work.” New mayors in three northern communities were prevented from entering municipal buildings, with small groups of Serbs raising their hands at the entrances, apparently to show they were not there to take part in violence, according to Albanian news outlet indexonline.net, which also published photos. In Zvecan, the news website Kosovo-online.com showed clashes with police in front of the municipal building, while in Leposavic the main square was blocked with cars and trucks. Local elections were held in four Serb-dominated communes in northern Kosovo after Serb representatives left their posts last year. They had resigned in protest because Kosovo authorities’ refused to allow an ethnic Serbian association to coordinate work on education, health care, land planning and economic development at the local level. A 2013 Pristina-Belgrade agreement on forming the Serb association was later declared unconstitutional by Kosovo’s Constitutional Court, which said the plan wasn’t inclusive of other ethnicities and could entail the use of executive powers to impose laws. The two sides have tentatively agreed to back a EU plan on how to proceed, but tensions still simmer. The U.S. and the EU have stepped up efforts to help solve the Kosovo-Serbia dispute, fearing further instability in Europe as war rages in Ukraine. The EU has made it clear to both Serbia and Kosovo they must normalize relations to advance in their intentions to join the bloc. The conflict in Kosovo erupted in 1998 when separatist ethnic Albanians rebelled against Serbia’s rule, and Serbia responded with a brutal crackdown. About 13,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, died. NATO’s military intervention in 1999 eventually forced Serbia to pull out of the territory. Washington and most EU countries have recognized Kosovo as an independent state, but Serbia, Russia and China have not. "
U.S. accuses Russia's Wagner Group mercenaries of fueling war in Sudan,Dan De Luce,"May 26, 2023, 8:48 PM UTC",World,"The Russian mercenary outfit Wagner Group is sending surface-to-air missiles to one of the sides in Sudan’s war, fueling the conflict and destabilizing the region, the Treasury Department said this week in announcing sanctions against a Wagner commander. Wagner’s role in Sudan is part of a growing presence in Africa aimed at undercutting U.S. and French influence and profiting off African countries’ mining wealth, with the proceeds helping to fund Russia’s war in Ukraine, experts said. Wagner has had a presence in Sudan since 2017, providing security services and overseeing gold mining concessions. The Treasury Department said Thursday that “the Wagner Group has been supplying Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces with surface-to-air missiles to fight against Sudan’s army, contributing to a prolonged armed conflict that only results in further chaos in the region.” The Rapid Support Forces have been fighting the Sudanese military for control of the country since April, and the violence has left hundreds dead and more than a million people displaced. The Biden administration has warned about Wagner’s presence in Sudan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month the mercenary outfit “simply brings more death and destruction” where it operates. Russia’s embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The Treasury Department on Thursday imposed sanctions on Wagner’s chief in Mali, Ivan Aleksandrovich Maslov, saying the group may be seeking help from Mali to secure military gear for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Maslov has worked “in close coordination” with Malian officials and arranges meetings between regional governments and the head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, according to the Treasury Department. “The Wagner Group may be attempting to obscure its efforts to acquire military equipment for use in Ukraine, including by working through Mali and other countries where it has a foothold,” the Treasury Department said in a statement. Wagner’s employees “may have been attempting to work through Mali to acquire warfighting equipment such as mines, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, radar, and counterbattery systems for use in Ukraine,” the department said. The accusation from Washington comes after a leaked U.S. intelligence document suggested that Mali’s interim president, Assimi Goita, an army officer who seized power in a coup, allegedly offered to obtain weapons from Turkey on behalf of the Wagner Group. The document, part of a trove of top-secret Defense Department material that surfaced on the social media platform Discord, stated that Wagner associates in early February met with Turkish contacts to purchase weapons and equipment for Wagner’s operations in Mali and Ukraine. “Additionally, Malian Transition President Goita had confirmed that Mali could acquire weapons from Turkey on Vagner’s behalf,” according to the document, which was obtained by NBC News and other news outlets. U.S. authorities have accused Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, 21, of leaking the secret documents. Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, told lawmakers in January that Wagner’s access to gold mines in Mali and the Central African Republic “directly funds” operations in Ukraine. Wagner units are playing a crucial role on the battlefield in Ukraine, relying heavily on prison convicts for infantry battles. Wagner’s wider aim has been to bolster Moscow’s influence in Africa, experts said. Wagner has been building its logistical capacity in both Libya and Sudan, taking advantage of its ties to local allies led by rebel commanders, said Nathalia Dukhan, a senior investigator with the Sentry, a nonprofit that focuses on multinational predatory networks. In Libya, Wagner has allied itself with Khalifa Haftar, who has waged war on the government in Tripoli, and in Sudan it has forged ties with Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti. In Sudan, Wagner has sought to use Hemeti’s RSF as proxies for their operations in the Central African Republic and Chad, Dukhan said. Although its tactics can vary, Wagner is seeking to project Russian influence in Africa, she said. “Ultimately, it opts for approaches that serve its geostrategic objectives, expansionist agenda as well as advance its business interests,” Dukhan said. According to a leaked intelligence document that first appeared on the Discord platform, a Wagner associate, Vitaliy Perfilyev, in February suggested launching an anti-U.S. media campaign in the Central African Republic after media reports that Washington was working to persuade the government to break its ties to the mercenary outfit. The U.S. and human rights groups have accused Wagner of committing atrocities in the Central African Republic, including summary executions and torture. U.S. authorities previously named Wagner as a “transnational criminal organization” and sanctioned its top leaders. "
New British Cycling rules bar transgender women from competing in elite female events,Associated Press,"May 26, 2023, 3:40 PM UTC",OUT News,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Riders who were assigned male at birth will be prevented from racing in British Cycling’s elite female events under a new transgender and non-binary participation policy published by the governing body on Friday. New rules for competitive events, due to be implemented this year, will see racing split into “open” and “female” categories, with transgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals and those whose sex was assigned male at birth eligible to compete in the open category. The female category will remain for those whose sex was assigned female at birth and for transgender men who have not received hormone therapy. The current men’s category will be consolidated into the open category, in which those whose sex was assigned as female at birth can also compete if they so wish. The new policy is the result of a nine-month review which included a consultation process with riders and stakeholders, including members of Britain’s team, as well as a study of available medical research led by British Cycling’s chief medical officer, Dr. Nigel Jones. That research was said to show a clear performance advantage for individuals who go through puberty as a male, and one which cannot be fully mitigated by testosterone suppression. There is still no set date for the new regulations to be implemented, with British Cycling saying only that it will be before the end of the year, allowing time for changes to technical regulations and discussions with the UCI, cycling’s world governing body, regarding implementation. The new policy diverges from that of the UCI, which is looking again at its own regulations after American transgender woman Austin Killips won the Tour of the Gila in New Mexico this month. The UCI allows transgender women who have gone through male puberty to compete in elite women’s events if they have had reduced testosterone levels of 2.5 nanomoles per liter for the previous two years. The British Cycling policy change also follows that taken by World Aquatics last year. British Cycling suspended its previous policy last April after transgender woman Emily Bridges sought to race at the national omnium championships as a female rider. Bridges described the move as a “violent act,” adding: “I agree there needs to be a nuanced policy discussion and continue to conduct research, but this hasn’t happened.” Jon Dutton, chief executive of British Cycling, apologized for the anxiety and upset caused during the 13 months since the previous policy was suspended. That previous transgender policy allowed riders to compete in the female category if they had testosterone levels below five nanomoles per liter for a 12-month period prior to competition. The governing body will continue to study new research as it becomes available with the policy being regularly reviewed. “It’s an incredibly emotive and at times divisive subject area,” Dutton said. “We have taken many months to look at three areas: firstly a consultation with the athletes affected and the wider cycling community; secondly looking at the medical research available at this point in time; and thirdly from the legal viewpoint in terms of the association with the Equalities Act. “We’ve made a decision on the balance of all three to give clarity, to give direction and that clear way forward for any athletes affected.” "
"Pope Francis skipped audiences because of a fever, Vatican says",Reuters,"May 26, 2023, 1:16 PM UTC",World,"Pope Francis did not receive anyone in audiences on Friday because he has a fever, the Vatican said on Friday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni did not provide any further details on the health of the 86-year-old Roman Catholic leader. “Because of a fever, Pope Francis did not receive (anyone) in audiences this morning,” Bruni said in response to a reporter’s question on why none were listed on his daily schedule earlier in the day. Francis spent five days in a Rome hospital at the end of March for bronchitis but recovered quickly following an infusion of antibiotics and returned to his duties, including a three-day trip to Hungary at the end of April. He appeared to be fatigued at a meeting with students near the Vatican on Thursday afternoon. Francis, who became pope 10 years ago, is missing part of one lung. It was removed when he was a young man in his native Argentina. None of the pope’s scheduled events have been cancelled and he is due to preside at a Mass marking Pentacost on Sunday in St. Peter’s Square. It was not clear if he would hold private audiences on Saturday. "
Passenger opens plane door during flight in South Korea,Stella Kim,"May 26, 2023, 8:00 AM UTC",World,"SEOUL, South Korea — A passenger opened an emergency exit door during a flight in South Korea on Friday, causing air to blast inside the cabin and slightly injure some on board, officials said. The plane landed safely. Some people aboard the Asiana Airlines Airbus A321 aircraft tried to stop the person, who was able to partially open the door, the Transport Ministry said. The plane with 194 people was heading to the southeastern city of Daegu from the southern island of Jeju. The flight is normally about an hour, and the incident occurred shortly before landing with the plane at about 200 meters (700 feet) above the ground, an airline official told NBC News. A video apparently taken by a person on board and posted on social media shows some passengers’ hair being whipped by the air blowing loudly into the cabin through the open door, as some grasp armrests for support. Police detained the unidentified person who opened the door, the airline said. His motive wasn’t immediately known. The incident terrified some passengers but no one was injured, though some passengers were assessed at a hospital, Asiana and Transport Ministry officials said. “The plane was a few minutes from landing,” Han Jae Min, an official from Asiana Airlines, said Friday in a phone interview. “Nine passengers were taken to the nearby hospital after landing because of breathing issues but we understand that they are in good condition,” Han said. “The male passenger who sat next to the emergency exit door that opened said that he was tinkering with the handle and that he opened the door. He is currently being questioned by the police and we understand that he told the police that he opened the door,"" Han added. The passengers included teenage athletes who plan to attend track and field competitions in Ulsan, another southeastern city.   "
"Suspect in killing of 4 people, including 2 police officers, in Japan captured after standoff",Associated Press,"May 26, 2023, 7:58 AM UTC",World,"Police said they arrested a man Friday who had holed up in his father’s house armed with a rifle and a knife after allegedly killing four people, including two police officers, in central Japan. TV Asahi showed the man with his hands on his head walk out of the house and be ushered toward a police vehicle. Masanori Aoki, 31, a farmer, was arrested by police under a court warrant on suspicion of murder in Nakano, a city in Nagano prefecture. Nagano prefectural police chief Iwao Koyama offered condolences to the victims and said the loss of two police officials is “extremely regrettable.” He noted that the suspect allegedly shot to death a police officer in the left chest with a hunting rifle. National Public Safety Commission Chairperson Koichi Tani told a regular news conference Friday that the suspect had licenses for multiple hunting and air guns authorized by the prefectural public safety commission and his license renewals have been properly made. Tani said police are investigating his gun usage records and that they plan to take necessary safety measures based on investigation results. Police said the house was owned by his father, a local politician. Koyama said two women who escaped while the suspect was holed up are the suspect’s mother and aunt and that they were uninjured. NHK said that the mother told police that the attacker was her son and that his father was chairman of the city assembly. Japanese media quoted neighbors described the suspect as a quiet person and that they were not aware of any family feud. Police said earlier that two police officers were shot by the suspect when they arrived at the scene after receiving an emergency call saying a woman was stabbed. The officers were apparently without bulletproof vests. On Friday, Nagano police chief said the suspect allegedly stabbed to death the 66-year-old woman with a survival knife. A witness told NHK on Thursday that a woman fell while being chased by the suspect, who then stabbed her with a knife and shot at two police officers as they arrived at the scene in a patrol car. The woman and the two police officers were pronounced dead at a hospital. An older woman, who was injured but could not be rescued because she was near the suspect, was found dead early Friday, police said. During the standoff, TV footage showed police wearing bulletproof vests and carrying shields, with an ambulance nearby. Police sealed off a 330-yard radius around the house, and city officials urged people in the quiet farming neighborhood to stay home or stay at an evacuation center, where about 80 people reportedly took shelter. Violent crimes are rare in Japan. It has strict gun control laws and only a handful of gun-related crimes annually. But in recent years, there have been some high-profile cases involving random knifings on subways and arson attacks, and there is growing concern about homemade guns and explosives. "
China faces a new Covid wave that could peak at 65 million cases a week,Janis Mackey Frayer,"May 25, 2023, 10:49 AM UTC / Updated May 26, 2023, 3:28 AM UTC",Coronavirus,"BEIJING — China is bracing for a new wave of Covid infections that could see as many as 65 million cases per week by the time the surge peaks at the end of June. It’s a startling prediction in a country, where the pandemic originated in late 2019, that only months ago had enforced some of the harshest Covid control protocols on the planet. Now, with the latest omicron variant, XBB, fueling a resurgence in cases, the response from China’s government and the public is muted at best. The surge comes about six months after the country dismantled its sprawling infrastructure for dealing with Covid, including harsh lockdowns, mass testing, stifling quarantines and strict mask requirements. “People feel differently about this wave,” said Qi Zhang, 30, who works at a finance company in the northern city of Tianjin. “The last time, everyone was terrified, but now they don’t think it’s a big deal,” she told NBC News on Thursday. The new wave’s data was revealed by respiratory disease specialist Zhong Nanshan at a medical conference this week in the southern city of Guangzhou. According to state media, he told the audience that the wave that started in late April was “anticipated,” and that his modeling suggested China could be approaching 40 million infections per week. By the end of June, he said, the weekly number of infections will peak at 65 million. The United States, by comparison, was reporting more than 5 million cases a week at its peak last January. Like the U.S., China stopped providing weekly case updates this month, making it difficult to know the true extent of the current outbreak. The State Department said the U.S., which imposed a testing requirement on travelers from China in January before lifting it in March, was discussing China’s second Covid wave with allies and partners but declined to say whether travel restrictions were under consideration. Spokesperson Matt Miller said the department would monitor the situation in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before updating travel guidelines. “We don’t want to see people anywhere, obviously, suffering from Covid-19,” Miller said Wednesday. The U.S. government remains committed to working with China “on transnational challenges, including on global health matters and maintaining open lines of communication,” he added. Various versions of the omicron subvariants, including XBB 1.5, XBB.1.16, also known as “Arcturus,” and XBB.1.9.1, have been circulating in the U.S. since December and make up nearly all of the current infections in the country. Although the CDC isn’t regularly tracking new cases and the majority of new infections are likely going uncounted, hospitalizations and deaths are continuing to decline in the U.S. Experts suggest the U.S. already has a strong level of immunity against the highly transmissible form of the virus. During China’s first omicron wave in December and January, a different omicron variant was infecting millions of people every day, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums in cities across the country. Store shelves were emptied of fever medications and schools were shut down. About 80% of China’s 1.4 billion people were infected during that wave, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January. But immunity may have waned in the months since, raising the risk of reinfection. Zhong said at the medical conference that the government had given preliminary approval to two vaccines aimed at the XBB subvariants and that others could be approved soon. Though China’s current wave will not equal the “tsunami” of cases it experienced in December and January, older people and those with underlying diseases are still relatively under-vaccinated and are at high risk for developing severe disease, said Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. “But the number is smaller and so the good thing is that the hospitals then can take care of them in a better way,” he said. Joey Wang, 24, a student in Hebei province, said many people were finding Covid symptoms less severe this time around. But public fears also seem to have been eased by the change in government messaging. “No more media coming out trying to terrify the public, no more ‘fight the pandemic’ type of short videos to alert people, and no more hardcore measures like the lockdown,” he said. The Chinese government’s subdued response comes as it is trying to revive the economy and reassure U.S. and other foreign businesses, which would react negatively to the return of restrictions. “Covid-zero enforcement was very interruptive to business,” said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, “and so we said again and again to the Chinese government, what companies need is stability, clarity, so they can plan.” Zhang, the finance employee, said colleagues who recently tested positive were choosing to come to work anyway, contrasting it with the first wave when everyone spent long periods working from home. “When I look back to such strict Covid measures, it feels like a dream,” she said. “It makes me doubt if all those strict lockdowns were right if we ended up here anyway.” Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong.

"Mexico's president urges Latinos not to vote for DeSantis, slams hardline immigration stance",Reuters,"May 25, 2023, 10:34 PM UTC",Immigration,"MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Thursday urged Latino voters not to back Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in the next U.S. presidential election, accusing the Republican politician of trying to win votes at the expense of migrants. DeSantis said Wednesday he would seek the 2024 Republican nomination for president and vowed to build a wall on the Mexico border, the latest in a series of hardline comments on immigration that he says resonate with Latino voters who want strong enforcement. López Obrador dismissed those comments. “All of his playing politics with migrants was because he wanted to be the Republican party candidate,” López Obrador told a government press conference. “I hope the Hispanics of Florida wake up and don’t give him a single vote.” DeSantis, who has championed border security and derided so-called “sanctuary cities” where migrants can shelter, said he would impose strong controls on illegal immigration and limit asylum. “Day one, it’s a national emergency. We will mobilize all resources to construct the border wall, shut the border down,” the Florida governor told Fox News. As well as building a wall, he said he would seek programs similar to former U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Remain in Mexico,” a contentious policy that forced asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico while awaiting U.S. hearings on their claims. López Obrador, who has previously warned Republicans not to target migrants for political gain, also attacked Trump at the start of the former U.S. president’s administration for his immigration policies. At the time, Lopez Obrador was in opposition. After López Obrador took power in 2018 he acceded to pressure from Trump to tighten up Mexico’s borders. López Obrador’s time in office is due to end before the next U.S. election, and he is now seeking to muster support for a successor due to be elected in June 2024. "
Cuba's rural towns are hit hard with fuel shortages,Associated Press,"May 25, 2023, 7:58 PM UTC",Latino,"MARIEL, Cuba — Rosa López, a 59-year-old housewife, lit a charcoal stove to boil sweet potatoes and prepare scrambled eggs for her grandchildren. The gas cylinders she normally uses to cook her meals have not been available for almost two months in Mariel, a port town west of Havana. Not far from there, on the highway to Pinar del Río and under a scorching sun, Ramón Victores spent one week waiting in line at a gas station, hoping to fuel up the 1952 red Chevrolet he uses for work, moving produce from one town to another. Cuba’s most recent fuel shortage has crippled an already fragile economy, but it is hitting rural villages particularly hard, with residents resorting to coal fires to cook their food, scrambling to find transport to take them to work and spending days — and nights — at the gas station waiting to fuel up. The Associated Press visited a dozen villages in the provinces of Artemisa and Mayabeque, to the east and west of Havana, to talk to people about how the fuel shortage is affecting their daily lives and what they’re doing to dodge yet another crisis. With food and medications already in short supply amid an economy that was severely hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic, the end of the country’s two-currency system and a tightening of U.S. sanctions, the lack of fuel and cooking gas is perceived by many Cubans in the island’s countryside as the last straw. López, the housewife in Mariel, has been using coal and firewood to cook her meals since the government suspended the sale of gas cylinders over a month ago. A system of coupons in place now organizes the delivery of precious cooking gas, but López is number 900 in line and not sure when she’ll be able to get her hands on one. About 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Mariel, on the road to Pinar del Río, a group of small vehicles joined a long queue of tractors and other farming equipment at a gas station waiting for their turn to fill up, with many waiting for up to one week. Manuel Rodríguez, a 67-year-old gardener, waited four days in line, hoping to fuel his battered motorcycle. But instead of settling for the mere three liters needed to fill it up, he came up with an ingenious way to take advantage of the 10-liter maximum allowed per user: He strapped a 10-liter plastic tank to the frame of his blue motorcycle, acknowledging the contraption might not precisely be the safest way to travel. “It’s a bit dangerous,” he said while showing off his invention. “But it works!” The lack of fuel is also making it harder for residents of small villages to go to work and move around neighboring towns. María de la Caridad Cordero, a 58-year-old teacher in Güines, in the province of Mayabeque, waited for a ride to Jagüey Grande to visit her brother. “If I don’t find anything by noon, I’ll just go back home and try again tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow,” she said. Ultimately, after two hours standing by the road, waving money unsuccessfully trying to entice the sporadic drivers to pick her up, she and a dozen other villagers hopped on a yellow school bus that suddenly came to a screeching halt. Back in Mariel, López and her family said they found temporary relief in a small plot of land where they built a coal stove and grow some fruits and vegetables. Yet, there are basic food items that are still hard to come by. “There’s no cooking oil at the bodega,” she says. “Hopefully, we’ll get some tomorrow.” "
"Connecticut woman's leg bit off in shark attack in Turks and Caicos, police say",Minyvonne Burke,"May 25, 2023, 5:51 PM UTC",World,"A 22-year-old Connecticut woman had her leg bitten off in a shark attack while she and a friend were snorkeling in Turks and Caicos, local police said. The woman, who has not been identified, was taken to Cheshire Hall Medical Centre in serious condition, the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force said in an Instagram statement. Police said the woman and her friend were snorkeling Wednesday just after 3 p.m. outside a resort near the Leeward Marina in Providenciales, one of the islands, when she was attacked. A spokesperson at the resort, however, said the woman was not a guest and the incident does not have anything to do with the resort or the Leeward Marina. ""Our understanding is that she was the guest of another resort and the client of a boat excursion company, neither of which we are affiliated with nor located near,"" spokesperson Stephanie Mack said in a statement. Authorities said that the employee of a resort located in the vicinity of the Leeward Marina called police about the shark attack and requested an ambulance. The employee indicated that the woman had her leg bitten off by a shark, the police statement said. The police department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. "

U.S. Navy destroyer sunk in WWII discovered off the Japanese coast,Lyme Cho,"May 25, 2023, 1:46 PM UTC",World,"Wreckage from a U.S. Navy destroyer sunk by a kamikaze aircraft attack during World War II has been discovered by a team of underwater explorers in the Pacific Ocean. The USS Mannert L. Abele was operating off the northern coast of the Japanese island of Okinawa on April 12, 1945, when it suddenly found itself ""surrounded by hostile planes,” the Naval History and Heritage Command said in a news release this week, as it announced the ship had been identified Thursday. After the Sumner-class destroyer engaged with and damaged multiple enemy aircraft, a plane managed to crash next to it, penetrating its side, the command said, adding that a minute later it was “at the waterline by a Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka.” Known as the “Cherry Blossom,” the Ohka was a rocket-powered human-guided bomb “and the resulting explosion caused the ship’s bow and stern to buckle rapidly,” the release said, adding that it became the first U.S. warship sunk by the weapon which was identified as “one of the first cruise missiles,” and fired up to 425 mph. Along with four fighter aircraft, inshore Fire Support ships fought further enemy attacks and began rescuing the Abele's survivors. However, 84 sailors were lost at sea. The ship’s discovery “allows some closure to the families of those lost, and provides us all another opportunity to remember and honor them,” said command Director Samuel J. Cox, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral. The ship was found in December by a group called the Lost 52 Project, which searches for Navy submarines and warships sunk during World War II. The Lost 52 Project said in a statement on its website that the ship was providing support for Operation Iceberg, the codename for the Battle of Okinawa. It added that the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the same day “overshadowed,” the sinking. Five weeks later, America dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Tim Taylor, the leader of the Lost 52 Project, said in the statement that the discovery was ""very emotive"" for him because his father had  come ""close to the same fate"" when his ship, the USS Telfair, was hit by a kamikaze attack. The command said it had established the Abele as “U.S. sunken military craft protected by U.S. law and under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy,” and as a war grave of sailors respected by all. Discovery expeditions continue to seek U.S. Navy vessels lost during World War II. Submarine USS Albacore was identified by the command near the coast of Hokkaido in February. "
Doing the Nutbush: One country’s strange love affair with Tina Turner,Sky News,"May 25, 2023, 1:24 PM UTC",World,"Many Australians feel a special connection to Tina Turner, with one of her early songs having found a unique place in the country’s culture. As fans around the world mourn the singer’s death at the age of 83, many in the country remember growing up learning the line dance to Nutbush City Limits, the song she performed with her then-husband and collaborator Ike in 1973. The song is about life in a small town in Tennessee and, despite it being a far cry from life in Australia, the dance has become a staple of weddings and parties. There are a number of reasons why this is very strange. Turner’s performances of the song never included the dance that has become so loved by Australians, and the song wasn’t even that popular anyway, peaking at number 14 when it was released in the 1970s and then at 16 when it was re-released in 1991.

Malaysia raids Swatch stores and seizes rainbow pride watches,Associated Press,"May 25, 2023, 12:53 PM UTC",OUT News,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Swiss watchmaker Swatch said Tuesday that Malaysian authorities raided its stores and confiscated 164 watches from its Pride Collection. It said Ministry of Home Affairs officials raided its outlets in various malls across Malaysia on May 13 and 14 and seized the watches because they “bore LGBT connotations.” The watches come in a choice of six colors, matching those on the gay pride flag, and have two rainbow loops on their straps. “We strongly contest that our collection of watches using rainbow colors and having a message of peace and love could be harmful for whomever,” Swatch Group CEO Nick Hayek Jr. said in a statement. “On the contrary, Swatch always promotes a positive message of joy in life. This is nothing political. We wonder how the Regulatory and Enforcement Division of the Home Ministry will confiscate the many beautiful natural rainbows that are showing up a thousand times a year in the sky of Malaysia,” he said. Predominantly Muslim Malaysia criminalizes same-sex relationships, with punishments ranging from caning under Islamic laws to 20 years in prison for sodomy under colonial-era civil laws. The opposition Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party recently criticized a scheduled concert in November by British band Coldplay because of its support of the LGBT movement. Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution told the AP that he is waiting for a full report on the matter before issuing a statement. Swatch said it has resumed selling the Pride Collection watches and that its legal department is looking into the seizure. Gay rights group Jejaka slammed the confiscation of the watches, saying it showed “a deeply unsettling level of intolerance.” “It is more than a matter of colorful watches. It’s about respect for diversity, freedom of expression, and, most importantly, love,” it said in a statement. It urged the government to promote a culture of acceptance and understanding rather than repression and discrimination. "
"NSO spyware used in Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, report finds",Kevin Collier,"May 25, 2023, 12:17 PM UTC",Security,"Invasive spyware capable of reading a smartphone’s messages and listening to calls was found on the phones of at least 12 Armenian journalists, politicians and civil society members, according to a report published Thursday by a group of nonprofit organizations. The spyware, called Pegasus and made by the Israeli company NSO, had previously been found on the phones of thousands of people around the world, leading to U.S. sanctions in 2021 and a lawsuit from Apple. But researchers said their most recent findings are unique — they believe it is the first time that the technology has been weaponized in an armed conflict between countries. Armenia has intermittently battled its neighbor Azerbaijan for decades. In 2020, a cease-fire was broken in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, leaving thousands dead. Since then, the two countries have been mired in a sporadic shooting war which has killed dozens more. The report, a collaboration among the international internet rights group Access Now, Amnesty International and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, calls for “an immediate moratorium” on the sale and transfer of spyware technology. NSO is the most notorious mercenary spyware developer in the world. It creates powerful programs like Pegasus, which can hack smartphones to reveal information such as contacts, calls and location. The report does not conclusively find that Azerbaijan was behind the spyware used on Armenian citizens, though researchers noted that all instances of the spyware’s use occurred during or near the time of conflict between the two countries and against those who would be considered traditional espionage targets. Citizen Lab’s research found two distinct Pegasus operators in Azerbaijan, both of which were registered by 2018. Three arms of the Azerbaijani government — the consul’s office in Washington, its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the president’s office — did not respond to requests for comment. NSO has long insisted its software is intended only for governments to catch terrorists and criminals. But its spyware has repeatedly been found on the phones of dissidents in authoritarian countries. A global media consortium found in 2021 that Pegasus spyware had been used on at least 189 journalists and 85 human rights activists around the world. NSO has denied responsibility in many of the cases where its software has been abused, arguing that its software was operated by independent, legitimate government agencies. While governments around the world have long abused NSO tools, the findings revealed Thursday are the first time that civilians have been hacked while their country is in armed conflict with another country. “We’ve expected this, but it’s still surprising when you see it,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, which has for years documented NSO Group attacks. “And it’s a reminder that mercenary spyware is not just a cybersecurity problem. It is a geopolitical problem, and it is potentially capable of changing the outcome of armed conflict,” he said. His research contributed to the investigation. In a statement, an NSO Group spokesperson said that it would not confirm any of its customers, but said it “will investigate all credible allegations of misuse.” “Past NSO investigations have resulted in the termination of multiple contracts regarding the improper use of our technologies,” the spokesperson added. The 12 confirmed victims worked as journalists, lawyers and for human rights and civic causes. One victim, television and web journalist Karlen Aslanyan, said he suspected his work made him a natural target. “If it was the Azerbaijani government, maybe they were trying to find some contacts, to listen to what kind of sources I have,” he said. Samvel Farmanyan, a political journalist and former politician, said that being hacked was profoundly disturbing. “Psychologically, it changes your life. Can you imagine that you have the feeling that you are under surveillance, and you don’t know who is surveilling you and what the purposes are?” he said. Governments around the world should take this as a wake-up call that their citizens can easily be surveilled by countries that have access to spyware, Scott-Railton said. “They need to be in a position where they understand just how serious this threat is, and how it may have been used around this conflict and other ongoing conflicts,” he said.

U.S. distances itself from pro-Ukraine incursion into Russia that involved American military vehicles,Alexander Smith,"May 24, 2023, 11:20 AM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 11:28 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"The United States has sought to distance itself from a dramatic raid into Russian territory by pro-Ukraine fighters who appeared to use American equipment in their attack. Moscow said Tuesday it had fought off an assault in its Belgorod region after two days of battles with attackers who had staged a cross-border raid. Much is unclear about the fighting. Russia says the raid was conducted by saboteurs from the Ukrainian military; Ukraine says it was carried out by Russian citizens who rose up independently. Washington has provided billions of dollars of military assistance to Kyiv, but has sought to restrict its use to the defense of Ukrainian territory, rather than attacks on Russian soil that could potentially be used as a reason for the Kremlin to escalate the conflict. Video posted by the Russian Defense Ministry and verified by NBC News show American-made Humvees and MRAP armored vehicles at a Russian border checkpoint following the alleged incursion by pro-Ukraine and anti-Putin fighters. The Russian Volunteer Corps  — which says it is made up of Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine, some of whom have endorsed neo-Nazi ideologies — also posted video Wednesday morning showing it in possession of MRAP vehicles, although it wasn’t clear where it was filmed. The group has claimed to be behind a previous cross-border raid. Denis Kapustin, its white nationalist leader who has pro-Nazi views, told the Financial Times newspaper that his group was in possession of the American-made vehicles but declined to say how it got them. Kapustin, who also goes by Nikitin, is a well-known skinhead and an ex-soccer hooligan. Some analysts questioned the appearance of the vehicles in the video shared by the Russian Defense Ministry, pointing to a lack of visible damage and their placement. “It’s possible the vehicles were used in some form of assault, but it’s also possible the image is staged — a long-standing practice of disinformation employed by the Kremlin to cast a narrative. This narrative conveniently matched the domestic Russian audience narrative that the U.S. and NATO threaten the security of Russia,” said Clint Watts, a national security analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. Asked about the images, U.S. officials said they were monitoring the reports. ""It’s something we’re keeping a close eye on,"" Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Defense Department spokesman. ""I don't know if it's true or not, in terms of the veracity of that imagery."" He added that the U.S. has not authorized Ukraine to give this equipment to anyone else, and that Ukraine has not asked for the right to do so. “We’re skeptical at this time of the veracity of these reports,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. Both of them stressed that the U.S. does not ""encourage or enable strikes inside of Russia,"" as Miller put it. “But, as we’ve also said,” he added, “it is up to Ukraine to decide how to conduct this war.” This caveat is part of a wider debate in the West about how much military backing to give Ukraine without provoking a direct war with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""It is no secret to us that more and more equipment is being supplied"" to Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a daily news briefing Wednesday. And ""it's no secret that this equipment is used against our military,"" he said. Turning his attention to the U.S. and its allies, he added, ""It's no secret that the direct and indirect involvement of these Western countries in this conflict is growing every day. We draw the appropriate conclusions."" Half of Americans support the Pentagon's ongoing supply of weapons to Ukraine, according to a survey by the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy and the The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research this week. If the images of American vehicles are genuine, it's not clear how they came to be used in a battle on Russian soil. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said 70 attackers, who he said were saboteurs from the Ukraine military, were killed but did not mention Russian casualties. Kyiv denies this. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence directorate, told NBC News that the attackers were Russian citizens from the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion. The militias ""acted completely autonomously,"" he said, while the Ukrainian army is ""engaged solely in the liberation of occupied Ukrainian territories within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine."" The group said in its Telegram channel that the goal of the operation was to “liberate” the border region, which lies some 45 miles north of the city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine and far from the war's front lines. The huge arsenal provided to Ukraine by its Western backers, including British cruise missiles and American F-16s, comes with the strict requirement that it’s not used to target Russia itself. “So for Ukraine to pull this off they absolutely have to do it in a deniable fashion through proxies,” said Samuel Ramani, an expert in Russia’s military operations at the University of Oxford.

Mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin says his forces are handing control of Bakhmut to Russia's army,Associated Press,"May 25, 2023, 10:58 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"The head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner claimed Thursday that his forces have started pulling out of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, and handing over control to the Russian military, days after he said Wagner troops had captured the ruined city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner’s millionaire owner with longtime links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in a video published on Telegram that the handover would be completed by June 1. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defense ministry. It was not possible to independently verify whether Wagner’s pullout from the bombed-out city has begun, and the Ukrainian General Staff said Wednesday that heavy fighting was continuing inside the eastern city after a nine-month battle that killed tens of thousands of people. Prigozhin’s Bakhmut triumph delivered a badly needed victory for Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has lost momentum and now faces the possibility of a Ukrainian counteroffensive using advanced weapons supplied by Kyiv’s Western allies. Top Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said Thursday that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was already underway, cautioning that it should not be anticipated as a “single event” starting “at a specific hour of a specific day.” Writing on Twitter, Podolyak said that “dozens of different actions to destroy Russian occupation forces” had “already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow.” Prigozhin has a long-running feud with the Russian military leadership, dating back to Wagner’s creation. He has also built a reputation for inflammatory — and often unverifiable — headline-grabbing statements. During the 15-month war in Ukraine, he has repeatedly and publicly chastised Russia’s military leadership, accusing them of incompetence and failure to properly provision his troops as they spearheaded the battle for Bakhmut. Wagner’s involvement in the capture of Bakhmut has added to Prigozhin’s standing, which he has used to set forth his personal views about the conduct of the war. “Prigozhin is … using the perception that Wagner is responsible for the capture of Bakhmut to advocate for a preposterous level of influence over the Russian war effort in Ukraine,” the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said. His frequent critical commentary about Russia’s military performance is uncommon in Russia’s tightly controlled political system, in which only Putin can usually air such criticism. His flat statement of what he would do over the next week in Bakhmut came a day after he again broke with the Kremlin line on Ukraine. He said its goal of demilitarizing the country has backfired, acknowledged Russian troops have killed civilians and agreed with Western estimates that he lost more than 20,000 men in the battle for Bakhmut. Meanwhile, Russian unleashed a barrage of Iranian-made Shahed 36 drones against Kyiv in its 12th nighttime air assault on the Ukrainian capital this month but the city’s air defenses shot down all of them, Ukrainian authorities said Thursday. The Kremlin’s forces also launched 30 airstrikes and 39 attacks from multiple rocket launchers as well as artillery and mortar attacks across Ukraine, the Ukrainian military said. In Russia, meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry announced Thursday that five Swedish diplomats are to be expelled from the country. According to the statement, the decision is a response to Stockholm’s “openly hostile step” to declare five employees of Russian foreign missions in Sweden “personae non grata” in April. Moscow additionally announced its decision to close its consulate in Göteborg in September, as well as its “withdrawal of consent” to the activities of the Swedish consulate in St. Petersburg. "
"Chinese hackers are spying on U.S. critical infrastructure, Microsoft and Western intelligence agencies say",Reuters,"May 25, 2023, 10:34 AM UTC",World,"A state-sponsored Chinese hacking group has been spying on a wide range of U.S. critical infrastructure organizations, from telecommunications to transportation hubs, Western intelligence agencies and Microsoft said on Wednesday. The espionage has also targeted the U.S. island territory of Guam, home to strategically important American military bases, Microsoft said in a report, adding that “mitigating this attack could be challenging.” While China and the United States routinely spy on each other, analysts say this is one of the largest known Chinese cyber-espionage campaigns against American critical infrastructure. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday the hacking allegations were a “collective disinformation campaign” from the Five Eyes countries, a reference to the intelligence-sharing grouping of countries made up of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the UK. Mao said the campaign was launched by the U.S. for geopolitical reasons and that the report from Microsoft analysts showed that the U.S. government was expanding its channels of disinformation beyond government agencies. “But no matter what varied methods are used, none of this can change the fact that the United States is the empire of hacking,” she told a regular news briefing in Beijing. It was not immediately clear how many organizations were affected, but the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) said it was working with partners including Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the UK, as well as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to identify breaches. Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand warned they could be targeted by the hackers too. Microsoft analysts said they had “moderate confidence” that this Chinese group, which it dubbed “Volt Typhoon,” was developing capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and the Asia region during future crises. “It means they are preparing for that possibility,” said John Hultquist, who heads threat analysis at Google’s Mandiant Intelligence. The Chinese activity is unique and worrying also because analysts don’t yet have enough visibility on what this group might be capable of, he added. “There is greater interest in this actor because of the geopolitical situation.” As China has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure in its claim to democratically governed Taiwan, U.S. President Joe Biden has said he would be willing to use force to defend Taiwan. Security analysts expect Chinese hackers could target U.S. military networks and other critical infrastructure if China invades Taiwan. The NSA and other Western cyber agencies urged companies that operate critical infrastructure to identify malicious activity using the technical guidance they issued. “It is vital that operators of critical national infrastructure take action to prevent attackers hiding on their systems,” Paul Chichester, director at the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, said in a joint statement with the NSA. Microsoft said the Chinese hacking group has been active since at least 2021 and has targeted several industries including communications, manufacturing, utility, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology and education. NSA cybersecurity director Rob Joyce said the Chinese campaign was using “built-in network tools to evade our defenses and leaving no trace behind.” Such techniques are harder to detect as they use “capabilities already built into critical infrastructure environments,” he added. As opposed to using traditional hacking techniques, which often involve tricking a victim into downloading malicious files, Microsoft said this group infects a victim’s existing systems to find information and extract data. Guam is home to U.S. military facilities that would be key to responding to any conflict in the Asia-Pacific region. It is also a major communications hub connecting Asia and Australia to the United States by multiple submarine cables. Bart Hoggeveen, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who specializes in state-sponsored cyber attacks in the region, said the submarine cables made Guam “a logical target for the Chinese government” to seek intelligence. “There is high vulnerability when cables land on shore,” he said. New Zealand said it would work toward identifying any such malicious cyber activity in its country. “It’s important for the national security of our country that we’re transparent and upfront with Australians about the threats that we face,” Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs and Cyber Security Clare O’Neil said. Canada’s cybersecurity agency said it had no reports of Canadian victims of this hacking as yet. “However, Western economies are deeply interconnected,” it added. “Much of our infrastructure is closely integrated and an attack on one can impact the other.” "
Pro-Ukraine border raid exposes Russian defenses and divisions,Patrick Smith,"May 25, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"A cross-border incursion into Russia from Ukraine sparked days of chaotic fighting that have fueled new disquiet about the Kremlin's ability to defend its territory without leaving its military exposed on the front lines. Moscow said Wednesday it had successfully fought off the assault in the border region of Belgorod, but not before drone attacks and fighters on the ground did damage to homes and infrastructure while forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. Though it appeared to achieve little militarily, the operation raised awkward questions for Russian President Vladimir Putin 15 months into his invasion. It could deal a further blow to the Kremlin's standing at home and potentially leave its troops stretched in Ukraine as it scrambles to respond, according to prominent Russian military voices and Western military analysts. The attackers’ identity is contested. Ukraine said that the raid was carried out by Russian citizens who independently rose up against the Putin regime; Russia has called them Ukrainian saboteurs, and two groups with far-right ties claiming to be Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine have said they were responsible. In any case, the attack has illustrated the ease with which pro-Ukrainian fighters can cause trouble for the Kremlin as its long-anticipated counteroffensive gets underway. "
Iran unveils latest version of ballistic missile amid wider tensions over nuclear program,Associated Press,"May 25, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",World,"Iran unveiled on Thursday what it dubbed the latest iteration of its liquid-fueled Khorramshahr ballistic missile amid wider tensions with the West over its nuclear program. Authorities showed off the Khorramshahr-4 to journalists at an event in Tehran, with the missile on a truck-mounted launcher. Defense Minister Gen. Mohammad Reza Ashtiani said the missile could be prepared for launch in a short period. Iranian officials described the missile as having a 1,240-mile range with a 3,300-pound warhead. They also released undated video footage purportedly showing a successful launch of the missile. The Khorramshahr-4 is named after an Iranian city that was the scene of heavy fighting during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. The missile also is called Kheibar, after a Jewish fortress conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century — in what is now Saudi Arabia. Regional tensions likely played a role in Iran’s missile display Thursday. A miniature example of Jerusalem’s golden Dome of the Rock on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a holy site in both Islam and Judaism that Jews call the Temple Mount, stood next to the mobile launcher. Iran views Israel as its archenemy and arming anti-Israeli militant groups in the Palestinian territories and surrounding countries. Tensions between the two nations are high, particularly as Iran enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. The Khorramshahr would be able to reach Israel. It remains unclear, however, why the missile has been called Khorramshahr-4 as only two other variants of the missile are publicly known. It is modeled after North Korea’s Musudan ballistic missile.

"FBI releases its files on Queen Elizabeth II, revealing fears of ‘everpresent’ IRA threats",Lewis Kamb,"May 24, 2023, 8:44 PM UTC",U.K. Royals,"Before Queen Elizabeth II’s visit to San Francisco in 1983, a city police officer who regularly patronized an Irish pub warned federal agents about a potential threat against the queen by an Irish Republican Army sympathizer who was bent on revenge for the death of his daughter, newly released FBI records show. The unidentified police officer claimed that on Feb. 4, 1983 — about a month before Ronald and Nancy Reagan hosted the visit from the queen and Prince Philip — he received a phone call from a man he knew from the pub “who claimed that his daughter had been killed in Northern Ireland by a rubber bullet,” according to a confidential FBI teletype. “This man additionally claimed that he was going to attempt to harm Queen Elizabeth and would do this either by dropping some object off the Golden Gate Bridge onto the royal yacht Britannia when it sails underneath, or would attempt to kill Queen Elizabeth when she visited Yosemite National Park,” the memo states. The teletype is among 102 pages of FBI records about Elizabeth that were publicly released late Monday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by NBC News and other media to the agency following the queen’s death on Sept. 8. The records — posted in The Vault, the FBI’s public website where documents of widespread interest are often released — mostly reflect standard behind-the-scenes communications about a visiting head of state, including federal agents’ shared memos, itineraries, press clippings and other documents largely related the queen’s various visits to the United States, dating back to 1976. Though the records — some of which are heavily redacted — don’t indicate that the San Francisco threat ever developed beyond just the words of an angry pub patron, they clearly reflect a persistent source of potential danger for the queen whenever she visited the U.S.: the IRA and its sympathizers. Formed in the late 1960s as a secret armed wing of the political movement Sinn Féin, the modern version of the Irish Republican Army was dedicated to removing British forces from Northern Ireland and unifying Ireland, often by violent means. The documents show FBI agents routinely shared intelligence and preparations with the U.S. Secret Service, local police agencies and other law enforcement about the IRA and its sympathizers in the run-up to, and during, the queen’s state visits. During her trip in New York for America’s Bicentennial celebrations in Battery Park in 1976, a New York City Police Department intelligence detective had advised the FBI of no arrests, but noted that a summons was issued to a pilot of a small airplane for flying over the park with a sign reading, “England, Get out of Ireland.” The FBI’s concerns about potential IRA violence against members of the royal family were not unfounded. In 1979, Elizabeth’s second cousin, Lord ""Dickie"" Mountbatten — a close confidant of then-Prince Charles — was killed in an IRA bombing in Ireland. In 1989, prior to the queen’s visit to the East Coast and parts of the American south, an internal FBI memo noted that, despite knowing of no specific dangers, “the possibility of threats against the British Monarchy is everpresent from the Irish Republican Army (IRA).” “Boston and New York are requested to remain alert for any threats against Queen Elizabeth II on the part of IRA members and immediately furnish same to Louisville,” the memo added. Two years later, during a 1991 visit when the queen and President George Bush planned to attend a Baltimore Orioles baseball game via helicopter, FBI agents shared intelligence with the Secret Service that “Irish groups” were planning protests at Memorial Stadium. A teletype about the 1991 ballpark visit cited a published article in the “Philadelphia Irish Newspaper” that stated “anti-British feelings are running high as a result of well publicized injustices inflicted on the Birmingham Six by the corrupt English judicial system and the recent rash of brutal murders of unarmed Irish nationalists in the six counties by Loyalists death squads.” The “Birmingham Six” were six Irishmen wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for the IRA bombing of two pubs in Birmingham, England, in 1974. Their convictions were overturned in 1991, a few months before the queen’s visit. While the FBI memo stated the article contained “no threats against the president or the queen,” it said its contents “could be viewed as being inflammatory,” and that “an Irish group had reserved a large block of grandstand tickets” to the game. The FBI often gleaned details from published news articles to help identify groups that planned to protest the queen’s visits, as well as kept in touch with local police agencies and its “assets” within protest groups, the records show. For the 1983 visit to San Francisco, police had warned the FBI that, due to the wide variety of protesters against both Reagan and the queen during her visit, “it will be very hard to anticipate and prevent incidents which may embarrass either the queen or the president.” But the records do not indicate the FBI or other law enforcement agencies arrested anyone for attempting to carry out any politically motivated violence or plots against the queen during that or any other visit. As to the potential threat to drop an item onto the queen’s yacht in 1983 made by the patron of the Dovre Club — an Irish pub in San Francisco’s Mission District — the FBI memo describing the threat noted the Secret Service planned to “close the walkways on the Golden Gate Bridge as the yacht nears.” A letter from the FBI on Tuesday notifying NBC News about the release of the records about the queen noted that “additional records potentially responsive to your subject may exist” beyond those posted by the agency this week.

Miami zoo apologizes after treatment of kiwi bird outrages New Zealand,Lyme Cho,"May 24, 2023, 5:33 PM UTC",Animal News,"A Florida zoo has issued a “profound and sincere apology” after it sparked outrage from thousands of New Zealanders about its treatment of one of their national birds. Zoo Miami said “concerns expressed” about the kiwi called Paora had “been taken very seriously,” after a video emerged on social media earlier this week of the bird being taken out of his enclosure and being firmly patted. The footage also showed the nocturnal creature entering a wooden box to seek a darker environment, only for someone to lift up the lid and expose him to a brightly lit audience. Within hours of the video appearing, an online petition complaining about his treatment had garnered thousands of signatures and New Zealand's prime minister and Conservation Department had commented on the matter. Paora was “being handled by dozens of strangers, petted on his sensitive whiskers, laughed at, and shown off like a toy,” wrote Jeseka Christieson, who launched the petition. “Kiwi are nocturnal animals, who should be kept in suitable dark enclosures, and minimally handled. He is unable to exercise natural behavior,” she said. “We hope this petition can reach someone who has the power to spark an investigation into his conditions, and relocate him to a more suitable environment,” added Christieson, who hails from Hamilton, a city on New Zealand's North Island. Her statement echoes the advice issued in a Kiwi Best Practice Manual published by the Conservation Department, which warns that the “mainly nocturnal” birds should not be  “taken out of their burrows just for the purposes of allowing people to see and touch them,” because they lack protection around the ribcage and vital organs. Several people who signed Christieson’s petition also expressed their outrage at Paora’s treatment. One described his treatment as “shameful” and “atrocious.” Others took to Twitter to complain, including wildlife photographer Holly Neill, who wrote that his treatment was “upsetting.” “I’m so mad about this. It’s being kept awake during the day despite being a nocturnal species,” she said. Asked about Paora’s treatment Tuesday, New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins told reporters that he thought it showed his compatriots “show a lot of pride in our national bird when they’re overseas and they do take action when they see kiwi’s being mistreated.” In a Twitter post, the Conservation Department said it would be “discussing the situation with the American Association of Zoos & Aquariums to address some of the housing and handling concerns raised.” In a statement, Zoo Miami offered a “profound and sincere apology for the stress initiated by a video on social media depicting the handling and housing of ‘Paora,’ the kiwi bird that is presently under our care.” It added that the “Kiwi Encounter” which gave visitors a chance to pet the animal for $25, would “no longer be offered.” “Though Paora has thrived at Zoo Miami while receiving the best care available, the development of the Kiwi Encounter was, in hindsight, not well conceived with regard to the national symbolism of this iconic animal and what it represents to the people of New Zealand, especially the Maori,” it said. “Plans are presently underway to build a special habitat for him that will continue to provide him with the shelter that he needs while respecting and supporting his natural instincts,” it added. “It will be developed in such a way that we can teach our guests about the amazing kiwi without any direct contact from the public.” "
95-year-old Australian woman dies after police shoot her with stun gun,Associated Press,"May 24, 2023, 3:53 PM UTC",World,"A 95-year-old Australian woman died Wednesday, a week after a police officer shot her with a stun gun in a nursing home as she moved toward him using a walker and carrying a steak knife, in a tragedy that has outraged many Australians. Clare Nowland, who had dementia, had been hospitalized in Cooma in New South Wales state since her skull was fractured when she fell on May 17 after Constable Kristian White shocked her with a stun gun. Police announced Nowland’s death hours after reporting that White has been ordered to appear in court on July 5 on charges of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and common assault. The charges are likely to be upgraded following her death. White and another police officer had gone to Yallambee Lodge, a nursing home in Cooma that specializes in residents with higher care needs including dementia, after staff reported that Nowland had taken a serrated steak knife from the kitchen. The violence against an elderly and incapacitated woman has sparked a national debate about the police use of stun guns in such circumstances and the competence of aged care staff. Police are allowed to use stun guns when lives are in danger. A coroner will determine the cause of death. Police say her injuries resulted from falling to the floor, not from the electric charge from the Taser-brand stun gun. White has been under police internal investigation since the incident and has been suspended from duty with pay since Tuesday. White and his police partner on the day have images of the incident from their body cameras, but police have declined to release them. The government elected a year ago is increasing resources for aged care. "
German police conduct raids on climate activists as impatience mounts,Associated Press,"May 24, 2023, 11:45 AM UTC",Climate in Crisis,"Authorities raided 15 properties across Germany on Wednesday and seized assets in an investigation into the financing of protests by the Last Generation climate activist group, prosecutors said — a move that comes as impatience with the organization’s tactics mounts. Munich prosecutors said they were investigating seven people, ranging in age from 22 to 38, on suspicion of forming or supporting a criminal organization. They launched the inquiry following numerous criminal complaints from the public that they received since mid-2022. Members of Last Generation have repeatedly blocked roads across Germany in an effort to pressure the government to take more drastic action against climate change. In recent weeks, they have brought traffic to a halt on an almost daily basis in Berlin, gluing themselves to busy intersections and highways. Over the past year, they have also targeted various art works and exhibits. Their tactics have drawn sharp criticism. On Monday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he thought it was “completely nutty to somehow stick yourself to a painting or on the street.” Leading figures with the environmentalist Green party, which is part of his governing coalition, have said the group’s actions are counterproductive.

Watch owned by China’s last emperor sells for record $6.2 million,Oliver Hu,"May 24, 2023, 11:10 AM UTC",World,"HONG KONG — A luxury watch that belonged to China’s last emperor has sold for a record $6.2 million at a live auction in Hong Kong. The rare Patek Philippe timepiece was once owned by Aisin-Gioro Puyi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty whose life was the basis for the 1987 film “The Last Emperor.” It was sold over the phone on Tuesday to an Asian collector in Hong Kong after six minutes of bidding, according to Phillips, the London-based auction house which managed the sale. Thomas Perazzi, Phillips’ head of watches for Asia, said it was a record for a wristwatch previously owned by an emperor as well as for the Patek Philippe Reference 96 Quantieme Lune, of which there are only eight known to exist. “I was delighted because after more than 3 years of hard work on researching, we found all the missing pieces of this beautiful puzzle,” Perazzi said after the sale. “This result brings Hong Kong to a new level as really a hub for fine watches and extremely important, collectible timepieces.” The auction house said a global team of researchers spent three years verifying the provenance of the 86-year-old watch, which Puyi gave to his Russian interpreter Georgy Permyakov while he was imprisoned in the Soviet Union after World War II. It is not clear how the watch came into Puyi’s possession. Patek Philippe watches have long been a collectors’ favorite, and in 2019 a one-of-a-kind Grandmaster Chime from the Swiss manufacturer became the world’s most expensive watch at auction, with a hammer price of $31.2 million. John Ng, a well-known independent watchmaker in Hong Kong who bid unsuccessfully for the emperor’s watch, said its sale could lead to a new trend. “Considering the current popularity of big, simple watches, small and complicated watches will receive more attention after this sale,” he said. Puyi was only 2 years old when he became emperor in 1908, leaving his family to move to the Forbidden City in Beijing. He was forced to abdicate in 1912 after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, though he continued living in the palace complex for years. In the 1930s, Puyi was appointed puppet leader of Manchuria, the northeastern region that Japan had occupied as part of its invasion of China. He tried to flee after Tokyo’s defeat in 1945 but was captured by Soviet troops and imprisoned in Siberia, where he had the watch with him. In 1950, the Soviet Union returned Puyi to China, where he was jailed for almost 10 years and then lived as a private citizen until his death in 1967 at age 61. Also included in the Hong Kong auction were a manuscript notebook belonging to Puyi, a leather-bound edition of Confucius’ “Analects,” and a red paper fan Puyi inscribed and gave to Permyakov in Tokyo. The fan sold for $77,846, six times the pre-sale estimate, while the other two items sold for a combined $121,634, almost five times the pre-sale estimate. "
Woman dies from injuries after being struck by police escort for U.K. royal,Associated Press,"May 24, 2023, 10:06 AM UTC",U.K. Royals,"The Duchess of Edinburgh expressed her condolences Wednesday after the death of an 81-year-old woman who was struck by a motorcycle that was part of the U.K. royal’s police escort.

Russia and China seal economic pacts despite Western disapproval,Reuters,"May 24, 2023, 10:03 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Russia’s prime minister signed a set of agreements with China on Wednesday during a trip to Beijing, describing bilateral ties at an unprecedented high, despite disapproval from the West of their relationship as the war in Ukraine dragged on. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin — the highest-ranking Russian official to visit Beijing since Moscow sent thousands of its troops to Ukraine in Feb. 2022 — held talks with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and met with President Xi Jinping. With the war in Ukraine in its second year and Russia increasingly feeling the weight of Western sanctions, Moscow is leaning on Beijing for support, far more than China on Russia, feeding on Chinese demand for oil and gas. The pressure from the West has shown no sign of easing, with the Group of Seven nations’ weekend declarations singling both countries out on a plethora of issues including Ukraine. “Today, relations between Russia and China are at an unprecedented high level,” Mishustin told Li in their meeting. “They are characterized by mutual respect of each other’s interests, the desire to jointly respond to challenges, which is associated with increased turbulence in the international arena and the pressure of illegitimate sanctions from the collective West,” he said. “As our Chinese friends say, unity makes it possible to move mountains.” The memorandums of understanding signed included an agreement to deepen investment cooperation in trade services, a pact on export of agricultural products to China, and another on sports cooperation. Russia’s energy shipments to China are projected to rise 40% this year, and the two countries are discussing technological equipment supplies to Russia, Interfax news agency reported. “With sanctions against Russia providing new opportunities for China, it is hardly surprising that China would be happy to engage actively, if not proactively with Russia economically, as long as whatever relationships they forge will not trigger secondary sanctions against China,” said Steve Tsang, director of The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) China Institute in London. “China’s policy towards the war in Ukraine is one of “declaring neutrality, supporting Putin and paying no price”, and the visit reaffirms it, particularly the support Putin element,” said Tsang. Xi visited Russia in March and held talks with “dear friend” President Vladimir Putin, after committing to a “no limits” partnership just before the 2022 Russia attack on Ukraine, which Moscow calls a “special military operation.” Beijing has rejected Western attempts to link its partnership with Moscow to Ukraine, insisting their relationship does not violate international norms, China has the right to collaborate with who it chooses, and their cooperation is not targeted at any third countries. “China is willing to work with Russia to implement the joint cooperation between the two countries, and promoting pragmatic cooperation in various fields can take it to a new level,” Li told Mishustin. Deepening of ties with China is a strategic course for Moscow, said the secretary of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, who held talks on Monday with Chen Wenqing, member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo who oversees police, legal affairs and intelligence. Beijing has refrained from openly denouncing Russia’s invasion. But since February, Xi has promoted a peace plan, which has been met with skepticism from the West and cautiously welcomed by Kyiv. Last week, China’s special representative for Eurasian affairs Li Hui visited Ukraine and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a European tour that Beijing billed as its effort to promote peace talks and a political settlement of the crisis. Li Hui is scheduled to visit Russia on Friday. "
What China wants to improve relations with U.S. and why it may be a tall order,Keir Simmons,"May 23, 2023, 9:54 PM UTC",World,"There are signs of deepening distrust between the United States and China even as the Biden administration and Beijing appeared to work to restart high-level talks. President Joe Biden this weekend predicted a “thaw very soon” between Washington and Beijing, the world’s largest economies. Tuesday’s arrival of Xie Feng, Beijing’s new ambassador in Washington, after more than four months, was a potential indication of warming ties, but the new envoy said the two countries’ relationship faced “serious difficulties and challenges.” “We hope that the United States will work together with China to increase dialogue, to manage differences and also to respect our cooperation so that our relationship will be back to the right track,” he told a small crowd made up mostly of journalists at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport before climbing into a van with aides and members of his family. While Xie may have been cautiously upbeat, a senior Chinese diplomat recently shared a gloomier assessment of U.S.-China relations at a briefing. “The bilateral relationship has once again encountered a freeze,” the Chinese diplomat told NBC News, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The conflicting signals serve to show what a roller coaster the countries’ relations have been on. Beijing reacted angrily to last weekend’s Group of Seven, or G7, summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which pledged to cooperate with China economically but be tougher in areas including “economic coercion,” human rights, Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong and Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. Beijing branded the communiqué “smears and lies.” Things were looking up six months ago after Biden’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Indonesia, igniting hopes for a new chapter. But relations plummeted to a decades-low nadir and a planned trip to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken was canceled after a “spy balloon” was spotted allegedly gathering information by flying over sensitive U.S. military sites in February. China, which apologized for the incident soon after the vessel appeared over the West Coast but later took a more defensive stance, says it was an unmanned civilian weather balloon. An hours-long meeting between national security adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, on May 11 reignited predictions of new high-level talks. Days earlier and after a practical freeze in diplomatic high-level communications between the two countries, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang in Beijing. Then came this weekend’s G7 and China’s furious reaction to it. But before high-level diplomacy can move forward — with one of Biden’s Cabinet members visiting Beijing or a call between Biden and Xi — there are a number of obstacles China believes need to be addressed, according to the Chinese diplomat who spoke to NBC News, as well as public comments by Chinese state media and officials. The unnamed Chinese diplomat, who is based in Washington, highlighted three examples of “concerns yet to be addressed by the U.S. side.” Among these is the ongoing FBI investigation into the Chinese balloon shot down by the U.S., they said. Privately, Chinese officials express concern that publication of that investigation might force either side into an embarrassing cancellation of another meeting or call between Xi and Biden. The Biden administration has indicated it wants to move on. At the G7, Biden dismissed the so-called spy balloon as a “silly balloon.” Blinken, meanwhile, did not mention it in his opening remarks at a congressional hearing last week. The unnamed Chinese diplomat said another concern “yet to be addressed by the U.S. side” is the “false accusations,” as the diplomat put it, that China has been operating illegal police stations in New York and elsewhere around the world. The FBI has arrested two people accused of running one of these police stations in New York, just one of dozens of similar investigations in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. China says the stations are there to help the diaspora with administrative issues. The diplomat appeared to rule out a Biden-Xi phone call in the near future. “It is hoped that the U.S. will work with China to address the issues in the relationship, and create favorable conditions for future interactions between the two top leaders,” the diplomat added. Favorable conditions will be hard to achieve, not least because politicians in the U.S. have largely coalesced around the subject of China. “China is an adversary to the United States in every way,” Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said in reaction to the diplomat’s comments. “We cannot afford to be complacent or passive in the face of China’s continued aggression,” she added in a statement to NBC News. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a longtime China hawk, stressed the importance of a bipartisan approach toward Beijing earlier in May. “If we in America rest on our laurels, if we let the CCP beat us, it would have serious consequences for the world’s democratic nations,” he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. China, meanwhile, appears to believe that it can forge closer ties with the United States’ European allies. A succession of Chinese diplomats have been touring the continent, including Foreign Minister Qin Gang and Wang Yi, the director of the Office of the Central Commission of Foreign Affairs. This week Li Hui, China’s Ukraine envoy, will continue a tour of Ukraine, Poland, Germany, France and Russia. At the G7, an idea promoted by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen gained traction. Rather than “decouple” from China, the West should “derisk” trade in industries where national interests are at stake. In other words, Europe should continue to have a dialogue and trade with China but also challenge Beijing when necessary and protect its vital industries. This comes even as Europe and the U.S. grow closer on the subject of China, according to Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk and research consulting firm Eurasia Group, author of “Superpower: Three Choices for America’s Role in the World” and a frequent commentator on world affairs. “China is consolidating economic power in ways that all of the G7 allies find problematic,” he said Tuesday. But Von der Leyen, and Europe in general, are not tough enough on China for many in Washington. “Our European allies need to make a decision,” Mace said. “They must choose whether to stand with China or to stand alongside the United States, and we cannot allow them to continue to play both sides.” And if Chinese state-controlled media is taken as a barometer of the elite’s view of the United States and the state of the relationship, nobody in Beijing is holding their breath. “Talk for the sake of talk will do little to remove the obstacles in the path of a sound relationship, which entails Washington’s concrete steps to demonstrate complete sincerity, and deliver on its promises,” according to an article in state news agency Xinhua earlier this month.

Evan Gershkovich's pre-trial detention extended for three months,Megan Lebowitz,"May 23, 2023, 4:47 PM UTC / Updated May 23, 2023, 6:58 PM UTC",Politics News,"WASHINGTON — A Russian court on Tuesday extended American journalist Evan Gershkovich's pre-trial detention by about three months, until Aug. 30. The Wall Street Journal reporter was detained in Yekaterinburg in March on espionage charges, which he, his employer and the U.S. government deny. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison. ""By the decision of the Lefortovsky District Court of Moscow dated May 23, 2023, the term of detention in respect of Evan Gershkovich, accused of committing a crime under Article 276 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, was extended for three months and one day, that is, until August 30, 2023,"" the court decision read. The decision comes after a Moscow court upheld Gershkovich's pre-trial detention in April. The Wall Street Journal said in a statement that Gershkovich had appeared for a pre-trial hearing on Tuesday. ""While we expected there would be no change to Evan’s wrongful detention, we are deeply disappointed,"" the newspaper said. ""The accusations are demonstrably false, and we continue to demand his immediate release."" U.S. Embassy officials were able to attend the hearing, according to the State Department, but it was not immediately clear whether they had they had the opportunity to speak with Gershkovich. Russia has previously denied embassy requests for consular access, including on May 11 and May 25. U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy was able to visit Gershkovich in mid-April, weeks after his arrest. “We once again call on Russia to comply with their obligation to provide consular access to him,” State Department spokesperson Matt Miller told reporters. “The claims are against Evan are baseless and we continue to call for his immediate release as well as for the immediate release of Paul Whelan.” Gershkovich's parents were also present at the hearing, although the State Department did not help to arrange their travel. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow repeated calls for Gershkovich's release and objected to Russia denying consular visits, saying it was ""deeply concerned"" by the decision to prolong the reporter's pretrial detention. Last month, the Biden administration designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained, moving his case to the State Department’s Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, which will allow the government to use additional resources to secure his release. Gershkovich's colleagues at the Journal reacted to the court's decision on Twitter. ""A horribly disappointing development as we continue to wait for justice for our @wsj colleague,"" wrote reporter Melissa Korn. ""RELEASE EVAN NOW,"" tweeted reporter Joe Flint. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken demanded Gershkovich's release in a statement for World Press Freedom Day. ""Far too many governments use repression to silence free expression, including through reprisals against journalists for simply doing their jobs,"" Blinken said. ""We again call on Russian authorities to immediately release Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and all other journalists held for exercising freedom of expression."" President Joe Biden discussed Gershkovich in his White House Correspondents Dinner remarks last month, saying the reporter had ""absolute courage."" ""We’re working every day to secure his release, looking at opportunities and tools to bring him home,"" Biden told attendees. ""We keep the faith."" "
Buckingham Palace rejects calls to return remains of 'stolen' prince to Ethiopia,Patrick Smith,"May 23, 2023, 12:59 PM UTC / Updated May 23, 2023, 2:25 PM UTC",U.K. Royals,"LONDON — The body of a teenage prince captured by British troops will not be returned to his remaining family in east Africa, the British royal family has said, in the latest high-profile feud over the legacy of its brutal colonial past. Buckingham Palace has refused a repeated request to repatriate the remains of Prince Dejatch Alemayehu of Abyssinia — which includes modern-day Ethiopia — who was taken from his home at age 6 in 1868 and died just over a decade later in England. His body is buried at Windsor Castle, one of King Charles III's official residences and the traditional site of British royal funerals and weddings. Alemayehu was taken from Africa after British forces defeated his father and looted his imperial capital, in one of the most notorious military operations of Britain's colonial era. Ethiopia has been asking for the prince's remains and other treasures to be returned for the last 150 years. Fasil Minas, a descendent of the Abyssinian royal family and a relative of Alemayehu, told the BBC: “We want his remains back as a family and as Ethiopians because that is not the country he was born in.” But the palace said this week that this wasn't possible as it would disturb other human remains buried nearby. ""The Dean and Canons of Windsor are very sensitive to the need to honour the memory of Prince Alemayehu,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to NBC News on Tuesday. ""However, they have been advised that it is very unlikely that it would be possible to exhume the remains without disturbing the resting place of a substantial number of others in the vicinity,"" the statement said. The Ethiopian Embassy in London is welcome to keep visiting the grave to pay respects, the statement added — but historians said the palace should do more to take responsibility for its past. ""This is such an emotional issue because it reminds everyone of Alemayehu’s plight — a child stuck in a foreign land, never allowed to go home,"" Andrew Heavens, author of a new book on Alemayehu and the British raid on Abyssinia titled ""The Prince and the Plunder,"" told NBC News. ""Emotionally, most people who get to know Alemayehu’s story feel his remains should be returned. He made it so clear before he died that he wanted to go back,"" Heavens said. The palace could do more to show Ethiopia exactly why the prince's body can't be removed, Heavens added. Alemayehu was the son of the emperor of Abyssinia, Tewodros II, a Coptic Christian ruler who had taken missionaries and British government officials captive after Britain refused to assist him in wars with mostly Muslim neighboring countries. In December 1867, Britain launched an expedition of 13,000 soldiers and 40,000 animals, including 44 elephants trained to pull huge artillery guns, according to the National Army Museum in London, to free the hostages. It took until April for them to reach the Abyssinian capital, Maqdala. More than 500 Abyssinians were killed and thousands injured in a 90-minute battle — some estimates are much higher and no complete contemporary record exists. British forces sustained two deaths, with 18 soldiers injured. Tewodros subsequently killed himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria. It took 15 elephants and around 200 mules to carry all the wealth the British looted from Maqdala. Alemayehu's mother, Empress Tiruwork Wube, intended to travel to England with her son but died on the journey. Queen Victoria took an interest in Alemayehu and arranged for him to study at elite schools, before he was sent to the military training academy at Sandhurst. He left after less than a year for the English city of Leeds, where he died of pleurisy — inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs — at age 18 in 1879. Victoria wrote in her diary: ""Very grieved and shocked to hear by telegram, that good Alemayehu had passed away this morning. It is too sad! All alone, in a strange country, without a single person or relative, belonging to him."" He was buried in the catacombs of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. For Jeremiah Garsha, an expert in the looting of human remains at University College Dublin, originally from California, there is no doubt that Alemayehu was stolen. ""He was, he was kidnapped,"" he said. ""You have a minor coming to another country as an orphan after his mother dies and then he himself dies at 18 — something should feel wrong about that. He's looted as well, like all the other curios and treasures that were taken."" The British obsession with Africa at the time created a huge market for stolen goods. This curiosity extended from ceremonial shields and religious items to living Black African people. ""You wouldn't kidnap a white child; Victoria's not going to end up with a child from [London suburb] Camden Town — there has to be a racial element, the foreignness for this prince to come and be at the palace,"" Garsha said. Many of the treasures that were taken remain in the British Museum, which has been discussing the possible return of certain items with Ethiopian officials since 2019. Several other countries, including Benin and Greece, have long petitioned the British government for the return of items that they consider stolen during the colonial era. "
"Russia claims it defeated alleged incursion from Ukraine, a day after attack began",Associated Press,"May 23, 2023, 8:57 AM UTC / Updated May 23, 2023, 1:21 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Russian troops and security forces quashed Tuesday an alleged cross-border raid from Ukraine, claiming to have killed more than 70 attackers in a battle that lasted around 24 hours, a senior Moscow official said. It was not possible to independently confirm claims about the armed incursion into Russian territory that began Monday. Nor was it possible to say with any certainty who was behind the attack or what its aims were. Disinformation has been one of the weapons of the almost 15-month war. Moscow blamed the raid on Ukrainian military saboteurs. Kyiv portrayed the incident as an uprising against the Kremlin by Russian partisans. It wasn’t immediately possible to reconcile the two versions. The battle took place in the Belgorod region, about 45 miles north of the city of Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed the armed attackers were routed by local troop units, air strikes and artillery fire. “The remnants of the nationalists were driven back to the territory of Ukraine, where they continued to be hit by fire until they were completely eliminated,” Konashenkov said, without providing evidence. He did not mention any Russian casualties. Four armored combat vehicles and five pickup trucks used by the attackers were destroyed, he said. Local officials alleged drones and artillery were also used in the assault. The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the raid targeted the rural area around the town of Graivoron, a town about 3 miles from the border. Twelve civilians were wounded in the attack, he said, and an older woman died during the evacuation. Earlier Tuesday, Gladkov urged residents who had evacuated to stay put and not return home until they received official instructions to do so. He said a “counterterrorism operation” was underway. While it wasn’t the first time Russia has alleged an incursion by Ukrainian saboteurs, it was the first time the operation to counter the raid continued for a second day, highlighting the struggles Moscow is facing amid its bogged-down invasion of Ukraine and embarrassing the Kremlin. Russian territory and Russia-occupied areas of Ukraine have also been hit by drones and explosions that have derailed trains, though Kyiv officials brush off accusations of orchestrating them. Ukraine said that Russian citizens belonging to murky groups calling themselves the Russian Volunteer Corps and the “Freedom of Russia” Legion were behind the assault. Russian dissidents unhappy about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s policies instigated the assault, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Tuesday. “These are Russian patriots, as we understand it. People who actually rebelled against the Putin regime,” she said. The “Freedom of Russia” Legion said in its Telegram channel that the goal was to “liberate” the region. The Russian Volunteer Corps implied in a Telegram post that the attack was over, adding: “One day, we’ll come to stay.” The post went up at around the same time as the Russian defense ministry comment about quashing the assault. The U.K. Defense Ministry said it was “highly likely” that Russian security forces were fighting partisans in at least three locations in Belgorod. “Russia is facing an increasingly serious multi-domain security threat in its border regions, with losses of combat aircraft, improvised explosive device attacks on rail lines, and now direct partisan action,” it said in a tweet on Tuesday. Russia’s Investigative Committee, its top law enforcement agency, announced an investigation into alleged terrorism and attempted murder in connection with the incident. Belgorod officials earlier this year said they had spent nearly 10 billion rubles ($125 million) on fortifications to protect the region from an incursion amid the war. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the raid “elicits deep concerns,” and a “bigger effort” was required to prevent such attacks in the future. Peskov refused to say how many attackers were involved in the assault, nor would he comment on why efforts to put down the attackers were taking so long. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, he redirected those questions to Russia’s Defense Ministry and the Federal Security Service, or FSB. Gladkov, the regional governor, said authorities imposed special controls, including personal document checks, and stopped the work of companies that use “explosives, radioactive, chemically and biologically hazardous substances.” The Russian Volunteer Corps claimed to have breached the border in early March. The shadowy group describes itself as “a volunteer formation fighting on Ukraine’s side.” It’s not clear if it has any ties with the Ukrainian military. The same is true for the “Freedom of Russia” Legion. The Belgorod region in southwest Russia, just like the neighboring Bryansk region and several other areas, has witnessed sporadic spillover from the war, with its border towns and villages regularly coming under shelling and drone attacks.

Disgraced children's TV entertainer Rolf Harris dies at 93,Associated Press,"May 23, 2023, 12:48 PM UTC",World,"Rolf Harris, the veteran entertainer whose decades-long career as a family favorite on British and Australian television was shattered when he was convicted of sexual assaults on young girls, has died. He was 93. His death was confirmed Tuesday by a registrar at Maidenhead Town Hall, west of London, to Britain’s Press Association news agency. Harris, who had a hit record with “Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport,” was adored by generations of children for his jovial on-screen persona, and was so respected in Britain that he was once granted the rare privilege of painting a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. But his reputation collapsed in 2013, when he was arrested in Britain in relation to sexual abuse allegations. Many were left in disbelief when in July 2014 Harris was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault on four young girls from the 1960s to the ’80s. Prosecutors said he had a “Jekyll and Hyde” personality who used his fame to exploit his victims. Among the victims was a friend of Harris’ daughter, who claimed he molested her when she was 13 to 19. Harris had said their relationship was consensual, and his relatives and friends supported him throughout the trial. But a jury convicted him of all charges, and a judge sentenced him to five years and nine months in prison. Harris had enjoyed a 60-year career as a successful television presenter, songwriter and artist. He was best known for his children’s television shows such as “Rolf’s Cartoon Time” and “Animal Hospital,” and had a number of hit songs in the 1960s. Born in 1930, Harris grew up in a suburb of Perth, Australia, and was an award-winning swimmer as a teenager. After several failed attempts at art school, Harris launched his television career with a slot on a BBC show in 1952. As well as hosting children’s shows, Harris was also known in the ’60s for performing popular songs including “Two Little Boys,” which became a No. 1 Christmas hit in Britain. By the 2000s, he was considered by many to be a national treasure of sorts: The queen sat for a portrait painted by him in 2005 to mark her 80th birthday, and he starred in a concert celebrating the monarch’s Diamond Jubilee outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. After his conviction, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which had described Harris as “one of the world’s most iconic entertainers,” said it would withdraw his fellowship. "
Cars set on fire in Cardiff as UK police face ‘large scale disorder’ after road crash,Associated Press,"May 23, 2023, 11:45 AM UTC",World,"Several dozen youths pelted police with objects and set cars and trash bins ablaze in Cardiff in local unrest that erupted after two teenagers died in a road accident, officials said Tuesday. Police said “large scale disorder” broke out after officers were called to the scene of a crash in the Ely district of the Welsh capital on Monday evening. “First and foremost our thoughts are with families of the two boys who have died following the collision in Ely and with those affected by the disorder which followed,” said Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis of South Wales Police. “These are scenes we do not expect to see in our communities, particularly a close-knit community such as Ely.” Scenes livestreamed on YouTube showed dozens of people, many wearing hoods or ski masks, milling around while others threw objects and shot off fireworks at a line of police officers with riot shields blocking one end of the street. A fire was burning and a helicopter could be heard hovering overhead. Shortly before midnight, a car was set on fire, while a second vehicle was overturned and set ablaze. The mayhem continued into the early hours of Tuesday, and at one point police officers were stationed outside Ely Police Station after suggestions it could be targeted. "
"Police in Portugal resume search for Madeleine McCann, British child missing since 2007",Associated Press,"May 23, 2023, 11:27 AM UTC",World,"Portuguese police aided by German and British colleagues on Tuesday resumed their search for Madeleine McCann, the British child who disappeared in the country’s southern Algarve region 16 years ago. Between 20 and 30 officers, some in uniform, could be seen in the area by the Arade dam, about 30 miles from Praia da Luz, where the 3-year-old was last seen alive in 2007. Portuguese police had set up a blue base tent and cordoned off the area to the media and public. Eyewitnesses said police began searching shortly before 8 a.m. Tuesday in an area some miles away from the tent. More than a dozen cars and police vans could be seen arriving in the area. On Monday, Portuguese detectives issued a statement saying the search was being resumed at the request of German authorities and with help from British officials. German prosecutors in Braunschweig said in a written statement Tuesday that “criminal procedural measures are currently taking place in Portugal as part of the investigation into the Madeleine McCann case.” They added that “the measures are being implemented by way of mutual legal assistance by the Portuguese prosecution authorities with the support of officers from the Federal Criminal Police Office.” “More detailed information on the background is not being released at this time for investigative tactical reasons,” the statement said. In mid-2020, German officials said a 45-year-old German citizen, identified by media as Christian Brueckner, who was in the Algarve in 2007, was a suspect in the case. Brueckner has denied any involvement. Brueckner is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for a rape he committed in Portugal in 2005. He is under investigation on suspicion of murder in the McCann case but hasn’t been charged. He spent many years in Portugal, including in Praia da Luz, around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. The case stirred worldwide interest for several years, with reports of sightings of her stretching as far away as Australia, along with a slew of books and television documentaries about the case. Rewards for finding Madeleine, who would now be 20, reached several million dollars. British, Portuguese and German police are still piecing together what happened on the night when the toddler disappeared from her bed in the southern Portuguese resort on May 3, 2007. She was in the same room as her twin brother and sister, who were 2 at the time, while her parents had dinner with friends at a nearby restaurant. "
Prince Harry loses bid to challenge decision not to let him pay for U.K. police protection,Reuters,"May 23, 2023, 9:47 AM UTC",U.K. Royals,"Prince Harry on Tuesday lost a bid to legally challenge the British government’s decision not to allow him to pay for police protection while he is in the United Kingdom. Harry, King Charles III’s younger son, was stripped of the police security usually afforded to royal figures after he and his American wife Meghan stepped down from their official roles in 2020 to move to the United States. The High Court in London, which last year already agreed he should be allowed to challenge an original decision to end the protection, ruled he could not also seek a judicial review over whether to let him pay for the specialist police officers himself. The decision to strip him of publicly-funded protection was taken by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known by the acronym RAVEC, which approves security for the royals and VIPs, such as the prime minister. Judge Martin Chamberlain said in his written ruling RAVEC was not arguably wrong to decide that allowing payment for protective security was against the public interest. His ruling comes less than a week after Harry’s spokesperson said the prince, his wife Meghan and her mother were involved in a “near catastrophic“ car chase with press photographers after an awards ceremony in New York.

7 people arrested in Spain linked to racial abuse cases against soccer star Vinícius,Associated Press,"May 23, 2023, 9:02 AM UTC",World,"Seven people accused of racially abusing Real Madrid player Vinícius Júnior have been arrested in Spain, police said Tuesday. Three were detained in Valencia for alleged abuse against Vinícius in a Spanish league match on Sunday. Four were arrested in Madrid for allegedly hanging an effigy of the player off a highway bridge in January. The arrests come after an outpouring of support for Vinícius after he said he was abused in Valencia. The case prompted widespread reaction from sports figures and government officials in Spain and worldwide. The nation has been criticized for its lack of action in racism cases in soccer. Brazilian government officials, including President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, had publicly expressed their concerns. Vinícius, who is Black, has been subjected to repeated racist taunts since he arrived in Spain five years ago, and especially this season after he began celebrating his goals by dancing. The Brazilian has heavily criticized Spanish soccer for not doing more to stop racism. The match against Valencia was temporarily stopped after Vinícius said a fan behind one of the goals called him a monkey and made monkey gestures toward him. Vinícius considered leaving the field but eventually continued playing. The effigy of Vinícius was hanged by the neck on the morning of a derby match between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey. Along with it was a banner with the words “Madrid hates Real.” The perpetrators used a black figure with Vinícius’ name on it, tied a rope around its neck and hanged it from an overpass while still dark in the Spanish capital. Police said three of those arrested belonged to one of Atletico’s fan groups, and the other was a follower of the group. Some had prior bookings with police for other crimes. The hate message on the banner is often used by Atletico’s hardcore fans, though at the time they denied being responsible for the display. The men arrested are between the ages of 19 and 24. Authorities said some were previously identified during matches considered at high risk of violence. Police showed images of them arriving in handcuffs and escorted by agents on Tuesday. Spanish media said police had used security cameras to identify the perpetrators but no action had been taken until now. Police did not say if the timing of the arrests had to do with the widespread attention being received by the latest abuse against Vinícius on Sunday. The lights at the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro were turned off Monday night in a show of solidarity for Vinícius. “It’s an action of solidarity that is moving,” Vinícius said on Twitter. “But more than everything, what I want is to inspire and bring more light to our fight.” Vinícius thanked all the support he has received in the last months in Brazil and abroad. “I know who you are,” he said. “Count on me, because the good ones are the majority and I’m not going to give up. I have a purpose in life, and if I have to keep suffering so that future generations won’t have to go through these types of situations, I’m ready and prepared.” Valencia banned for life a fan identified of insulting Vinícius during the game. Real Madrid took the case to prosecutors as a hate crime. The Spanish league has filed nine criminal complaints of cases of racial abuse against Vinícius in the last two seasons, with most of them being shelved by prosecutors. The league said Tuesday it will seek to increase its authority to issue sanctions in cases of hate crimes during games. It had been saying it can only detect and denounce incidents to authorities and the country’s soccer federation. Supporters have been fined and banned from stadiums for their abuse against Vinícius, but so far only a Mallorca fan may end up going on trial for allegedly racially insulting the Brazilian during a game. The first trial against a fan accused of racial abuse in Spanish professional soccer is expected to happen at some point this year; the case involved Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams, who was insulted by an Espanyol supporter in a match in 2020.

Sherpa guide Kami Rita scales Mount Everest for a record 28th time,The Associated Press,"May 23, 2023, 8:51 AM UTC",World,"Veteran Sherpa guide Kami Rita scaled Mount Everest for the 28th time Tuesday, beating his own record less than a week after setting it, as two guides compete with each other for the title of most climbs of the world’s highest peak. Kami Rita, considered one of the greatest mountain guides, reached the 29,032-foot summit at 9:20 a.m. local time Tuesday, according to expedition organizer Seven Summits Treks. His latest climb comes a day after fellow Sherpa guide Pasang Dawa matched his record of 27 trips to the summit. The race for the title began with Pasang Dawa climbing the peak for the 26th time on May 14, equaling Kami Rita’s previous record. Kami Rita went on to the peak three days later for the 27th time. With a few more days left in the spring climbing season, both Sherpa guides were on the mountain helping their clients up the snowy peak. May is the busiest month to make the dangerous climb since it has the best weather conditions. Kami Rita first summitted Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since. He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain. His father was among the first Sherpa guides. In addition to his Everest climbs, Rita has scaled several other peaks that are among the world’s highest, including K2, Cho Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse. Hundreds of climbers have scaled Mount Everest, or plan to make their attempt, this month. The Nepalese authorities have issued about 480 climbing permits to foreign climbers, which is the most issued for any year. At least as many local Sherpa guides would be accompanying them during the climbing season. So far, 10 people have died during this year’s spring climbing season on Everest. "
Australian Indigenous TV host quits program over racist backlash,Associated Press,"May 23, 2023, 8:41 AM UTC",World,"CANBERRA, Australia — Prominent Australian Indigenous journalist Stan Grant quit television hosting duties on Monday in response to online racist abuse over his comments during King Charles III’s coronation about historic Aboriginal dispossession. Grant, a member of the Wiradjuri tribe of Indigenous Australians and former international correspondent for U.S.-based CNN, said at the end of Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s weekly national panel discussion program “Q+A” that he was “stepping away for a little while” because his soul was hurting. “To those who have abused me and my family, I would just say: If your aim was to hurt me, well, you’ve succeeded,” Grant said. “I’m sorry that I must have given you so much cause to hate me so much, to target me and my family, to make threats against me.” Grant has been under fire since taking part in a panel discussion on the ABC ahead of the May 6 coronation ceremony in London. Topics included a push to have a president replace the British monarch as Australia’s head of state and Indigenous suffering from colonization. Critics complained that the ABC had soured the celebratory mood of the coronation. His supporters say inaccurate and inflammatory reporting of his views in the mainstream media has fueled racially abusive and threatening personal attacks on social media, wearing the news veteran down. After more than 30 years of news experience in Australian television, Grant wrote Friday in his regular ABC online column that Monday would be the last time in the foreseeable future that he would host “Q+A” because of the news media and social media abuse. “I take time out because we have shown again that our history — our hard truth — is too big, too fragile, too precious for the media. The media sees only battle lines, not bridges. It sees only politics,” Grant wrote. “The media has turned public discussion into an amusement park. Social media, at its worst, is a sordid spectacle. A grotesque burlesque. Lives are reduced to mockery and ridicule.” “I want no part of it. I want to find a place of grace far from the stench of the media,” Grant said. Grant was asked to participate on the panel “as a Wiradjuri man to discuss his own family’s experience and the role of the monarchy in Australia in the context of Indigenous history,” said Justin Stevens, ABC news director. “The responsibility for the coverage lies with ABC news management, not with Stan Grant,” Stevens said.

"New search to begin for Madeleine McCann, UK toddler missing since 2007, Portuguese police confirm",The Associated Press,"May 22, 2023, 8:18 PM UTC",World,"LISBON — Portuguese police have said they will resume searching for Madeleine McCann, the British toddler who disappeared in the country’s Algarve region in 2007, in the next few days. Portugal’s Judicial Police released a statement confirming local media reports that they would conduct the search at the request of the German authorities and in the presence of British officials. Earlier on Monday, police were seen erecting tents and cordons in an area by the Arade dam, about 31 miles from Praia da Luz, where the 3-year-old was last seen alive. British, Portuguese and German police are still piecing together what happened when the toddler disappeared from her bed in the southern Portuguese resort on May 3, 2007. She was in the same room as her 2-year-old twin brother and sister while her parents had dinner with friends at a nearby restaurant. In mid-2020, Germany’s police identified Christian Brueckner, a 45-year-old German citizen who was in the Algarve in 2007, as a suspect in the case. Brueckner has denied any involvement. The suspect is under investigation on suspicion of murder in the McCann case but hasn’t been charged. He spent many years in Portugal, including in Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. Prosecutors in the northern German city of Braunschweig in October have charged Brueckner in several separate cases involving sexual offenses allegedly committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017. Braunschweig prosecutor Christian Wolter said Monday his office would release a statement about the case on Tuesday morning. Madeleine’s disappearance stirred worldwide interest, with public claims of having spotted her stretching as far away as Australia, along with a slew of books and television documentaries about the case. Rewards for finding Madeleine reached several million dollars. "
At least 10 killed in a shootout at a car rally in Baja California,The Associated Press,"May 22, 2023, 5:29 PM UTC / Updated May 22, 2023, 6:11 PM UTC",World,"MEXICO CITY  — Authorities say they are investigating an apparent gunfight at an off-road vehicle rally in Mexico’s Baja California state that left 10 people dead and others wounded. Videos posted on social media showed heavy shooting at the rally in an area of Ensenada and at least three bodies lying on the ground. “Unfortunately, what happened during the tour was not in our hands,” event organizers said in a statement. “We are wholeheartedly sorry for the losses and their families. Our sincere condolences. We are as baffled as all of you since we have nothing to do with what happened.” The shooting, which took place early Saturday afternoon, provoked an intense mobilization of units of the army, navy, and state and local police. Baja California officials say gunmen in one vehicle opened fire on people and vehicles at the rally. State prosecutor Ricardo Iván Carpio said that vehicle was found to have “perforations from gunshots and traces of blood inside.” The state prosecutor’s office said there was evidence of crossfire suggesting it was a confrontation between members of organized crime groups. Authorities said the suspects have not been found, according to NBC San Diego. The identities of the victims and the conditions of those wounded have not been released. "
"In the Amazon, Brazilian ecologists try new approach against deforestation and poverty",Associated Press,"May 22, 2023, 2:38 PM UTC",Environment,"CARAUARI, Brazil — In a remote corner of the Amazon, Brazilian ecologists are trying to succeed where a lack of governance has proved disastrous. They’re managing a stretch of land in a way that welcomes both local people and scientists to engage in preserving the world’s largest tropical forest. The goal is ambitious: counter the forces that have destroyed 10% of the forest in less than four decades and create something that can be replicated in other parts of the Amazon. It began with a four-month expedition along the Juruá River in 2016. Researchers visited some 100 communities that at first sight looked similar: rows of wooden homes on stilts along the water. But they were struck by contrasts in the living conditions. To understand what they saw, it’s important to know that 29% of the Amazon, an area roughly three times the size of California, is either public land with no special protection, or public land for which no public information exists, according to a study by the Amazon Institute of People and the Environment. These areas have been shown to be more vulnerable to deforestation. Land robbers drive traditional communities off the land and then clear it, hoping the government will recognize them as owners, which usually happens. “It’s very unequal. Inside protected areas, there are many positive things happening, but outside, they seemed to be 40 years behind,” João Vitor Campos-Silva, a tropical socio-ecologist, told The Associated Press. The researchers were aware that the part of the river known as Medio Juruá, near the city of Carauari, has remarkable social organization and people manage its fish and forest products, such as acai, sustainably. The land designation here is “extractive reserves,” public lands where residents are allowed to fish and harvest some crops. "
Russia says it battles saboteurs in cross-border raid by pro-Ukraine forces,Reuters,"May 22, 2023, 2:36 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Russia said on Monday it was battling a cross-border incursion by saboteurs who burst through the frontier from Ukraine, in what appeared to be one of the biggest attacks of its kind since the war began. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Russia’s Belgorod region adjacent to northeastern Ukraine, said the Russian army, border guards, presidential guards and FSB security service were taking measures to repel the raid. No civilians had been harmed, and there was no evacuation under way, he said, describing reports of an evacuation as “lies”. “Do not listen to our enemies,” he said. Earlier, the Telegram channel Baza, which is linked to Russia’s security services, published footage apparently showing a Ukrainian armored vehicle advancing on the border checkpoint. Though there have been other reports of cross-border raids, an infiltration using armored vehicles would appear to be unprecedented since the war began. Baza said there were indications of fighting in three settlements on the main road leading from Ukraine into Russia. A group calling itself the Liberty of Russia Legion, which claims to be made up of Russians cooperating with Ukraine’s forces, said on Twitter it had “completely liberated” the border town of Kozinka and reached district center Graivoron. “Moving on. Russia will be free!” it wrote. Earlier on Monday, it released a video showing five heavily armed fighters: “We are Russians, like you. We are people like you,” one said facing the camera. “It is time to put an end to the dictatorship of the Kremlin.” NBC News could not verify the situation in the border towns. Ukraine’s military intelligence service blamed the incident on “opposition-minded Russian citizens” from two paramilitary groups, Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske said. Hromadske quoted military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov as saying the Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps were responsible for the incursion. It did not make clear whether he provided any evidence for the assertion. “Responsibility for these events was taken by citizens of (Russia), particularly the RDK and the ‘Freedom of Russia’ Legion,” he said, using the acronym for the Russian Volunteer Corps. “I think we all can only welcome the decisive actions of opposition-minded Russian citizens, who are ready for an armed struggle against the criminal regime of (President) Vladimir Putin.” Yusov said the Belgorod operation would create a “security zone” to protect Ukrainians from cross-border attacks by Russia. The reported incursion comes two days after Russia said it it had captured the final few blocks of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, Moscow’s first substantial claim of victory since last summer after the bloodiest land battle in Europe since World War Two. Kyiv said its troops were still fighting in the city and that it was pushing to encircle Russian forces after making gains on the flanks. "
"'Racism is normal' in Spain, star player says after abuse during game",Patrick Smith,"May 22, 2023, 1:51 PM UTC / Updated May 22, 2023, 2:34 PM UTC",World,"Spain has been branded a ""country of racists"" by one of its leading stars after he was subjected to abuse yet again by rival fans. Brazilian forward Vinícius Júnior called out Spain and its soccer league after the latest incident, which drew condemnation from world leaders and fueled renewed debate about racism on and off the field. The Real Madrid star pointed out supporters he said were hurling racist abuse including ""monkey"" chants at him during a game on Sunday night. Play was stopped for 10 minutes, with Vinícius subsequently sent off after an altercation with opposition players. After the fractious game, the 22-year-old — widely considered one of the most gifted young players in the world — wrote on Twitter that Spain's elite soccer competition, La Liga, had normalized racism by failing to stamp out racist taunts despite repeated complaints. The league, he said, ""now belongs to racists."" The game's result, a crucial 1-0 victory for Valencia, has paled into insignificance compared to the huge political debate it has sparked. "
Ukraine aims to encircle Putin's troops in Bakhmut after Russia claims victory,Yuliya Talmazan,"May 22, 2023, 12:27 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Russia may have effectively captured the symbolic prize of Bakhmut, but in many ways the battle for the city might only just be beginning. Moscow declared a triumphant victory in Bakhmut over the weekend, its first in nearly a year, with state media extolling its “liberation” and President Vladimir Putin promising “state rewards” to those who “distinguished” themselves in the war’s longest and bloodiest battle. However, Putin’s troops — exhausted and depleted by the sort of fighting not seen in Europe since World War II — may struggle to push deeper into the eastern Donbas region while Kyiv’s military will seek to take advantage of recent gains by trying to encircle them, according to Ukrainian officials and Western military analysts. Russian state media headlines on Monday declared Bakhmut was already being de-mined after the country’s defense ministry and mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said Saturday that forces led by Wagner fighters had taken full control of the battered city. Prigozhin posted images of his fighters raising flags over partially-destroyed buildings in the city, which has been left in ruins by months of conflict that has seen both sides suffer huge losses. A news anchor on Russia’s Channel One called the city’s capture “an event of historic proportions” and “a mission accomplished,” at the top of a newscast Sunday afternoon, as Putin congratulated Wagner units and Russia’s regular army, despite weeks of bitter feuding between Prigozhin and Russia’s top military brass. But the celebrations were dismissed in Kyiv, where officials insisted that the city was not completely under Russian control and that the battle was far from over. “Despite the fact that we now control a small part of Bakhmut, the importance of its defense does not lose its relevance,” Oleksandr Syrskyi, who commands Ukraine’s ground forces, said Sunday. “We continue to advance on the flanks in the suburbs of Bakhmut and are actually approaching the capture of the city in a tactical encirclement,” he added. Serhii Cherevaty, spokesman for Ukraine’s Eastern Group of Forces, also said late Sunday that its troops maintain control of “several buildings and fortifications in the southwestern part of the city.” NBC News could not verify the claims from either side about the situation on the ground. The conflicting messages may indicate that there are a number of things happening simultaneously and the battle for the city may not be over but rather entering a new phase, said Neil Melvin, the director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, a London-based think tank. Wagner forces have concentrated in the central area of the city and ceded control of the flanks to reinforced troops from the regular Russian army in recent weeks, Melvin told NBC News, giving the mercenary fighters sufficient strength to seize basically all of the city. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military appears to have withdrawn from its final positions in the center and concentrated on the flanks to the north and south, where it recently began pushing back Russian troops. It now seems to be aiming to surround the city, which could allow it to cut off and then destroy the Wagner forces in the center, Melvin added. “We continue to advance,” said Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar on Ukrainian TV Monday. ""Due to the fact that we moved along the flanks from the north and south and occupied certain heights there, we made it very difficult for the enemy to stay in the city."" "
"Greece’s center-right wins in landslide election, but will need new vote to form government",Associated Press,"May 22, 2023, 10:32 AM UTC",World,"After a most tantalizing of victories, having inflicted the heaviest defeat in half a century on the opposition, Greece’s center-right Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis confirmed Monday that he would seek a second national election within weeks to secure the majority he needs to govern alone. With 99.70% of the votes counted, Mitsotakis’ New Democracy party won 40.79% — twice the leftwing main opposition Syriza’s 20.07% — dominating 58 of the country’s 59 constituencies. Socialist Pasok came in third at 11.46%, while turnout was 61%. President Katerina Sakellaropoulou on Monday formally offered Mitsotakis the mandate to try and form a coalition government. But during a brief televised conversation, he told her he would return it within hours as there seemed no prospect of success. Mitsotakis voiced hope a new election could come as early as June 25. ND’s margin of victory far outstripped pollsters’ forecasts and was the biggest since 1974, when Greece’s first democratic elections were held after the fall of the seven-year military dictatorship. Athenian Fotis Hatzos said that while he had expected ND’s win, its hammering of the main opposition party took him by surprise. “What is there to say, (Mitsotakis) destroyed them,” he told The Associated Press. “He won fairly.” Markets welcomed what seems to signal the end of the political uncertainty that troubled the NATO and European Union member following the 2009 financial crisis, with the Athens stock exchange general index surging more than 7% at opening Monday and Greek bonds also rallying. But the one-off proportional representation system in effect Sunday means ND only gains 146 of Parliament’s 300 seats, five short of a governing majority. The new elections, expected no later than July 2, will revert to the previous system that grants the first party a bonus of up to 50 seats. That would ensure Mitsotakis a comfortable majority for a second term in power if Sunday’s result holds. The 55-year-old prime minister told President Sakellaropoulou Monday that he could see “effectively no way for the current parliament to form a government,” overcoming the “obstacle” of the electoral system. ”That is why I will return the mandate to you this afternoon, so that we can head for new elections” if other parties fail to form a coalition deal, “as soon as possible, perhaps even on June 25,” Mitsotakis said. “The country needs a strong and stable government with a four-year mandate and as soon as this is settled the better.” Mitsotakis had long suggested he would not seek a coalition partner whatever the election outcome. Analyst Wolfango Piccoli, who has followed Greek politics for years, said voters prioritized the economy and political stability over everything else. “ND’s overwhelming performance is largely due to the positive track record on the economic front of the past four years,” the senior political risk analyst at Teneo told the AP. “Syriza’s inability to convey a coherent and credible economic plan also helped PM Mitsotakis and his ND.” “The outcome of yesterday’s vote creates a window of opportunity for Greece to turn the page and move away from the toxic populist politics that emerged during” the financial crisis, he added. When Mitsotakis hands back the mandate, it will then pass to Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras, and then to Pasok leader Nikos Androulakis — neither of whom have any realistic chance of success. Each will have a maximum of three days to try to form a coalition. Once all options are exhausted, a senior judge will be appointed caretaker prime minister and new elections called. Mitsotakis, a Harvard-educated former banking executive, came to power in 2019 on a promise of business-oriented reforms and has vowed to continue tax cuts, boost investments and bolster middle-class employment. His victory is widely expected to spur an upgrade of Greece’s key credit rating to investment grade, which it lost during the financial crisis. That would strongly boost the country’s ability to borrow from international markets, broadening its bonds’ appeal to investors. Mitsotakis has been credited with Greece’s successful handling of the pandemic and of two crises with neighboring Turkey, while overseeing high growth and job creation after the end of the 2009-2018 financial crisis, but his term in office was tarnished by a wiretapping scandal and a railway disaster. Tsipras, 48, called Mitsotakis on Sunday night to congratulate him. “The result is exceptionally negative for Syriza,” he said in initial statements. “Fights have winners and losers.” Syriza gained 71 seats in Parliament. Tsipras, who was prime minister from 2015 to 2019 — riding a wave of anti-establishment feeling amid the financial crisis — said his party would gather to examine the results and how they came about. Tsipras transformed Syriza from a political minnow into Greece’s main leftwing political pole during the financial crisis, when he won office pledging to reverse resented cutbacks dictated by international creditors. Instead, he was quickly forced to impose further financial pain in return for a new rescue loan. Now, his political future is unclear, particularly if the forthcoming election confirms the trend set Sunday, when Syriza lost about 11 percentage points compared to its showing in 2019. Pasok leader Androulakis, however, is buoyant, seeing his party claw back some of the ground it lost to Syriza in the crisis — before which it traditionally dominated Greece’s center-left. Analyst Piccoli said the “devastating blow” suffered by Syriza and the failure of smaller leftwing parties to enter parliament “suggest that voters are determined to look ahead and leave behind the painful recent memories of the economic crisis.” “It remains to be seen whether Pasok will be up for the challenge of regaining a central role on the left side of Greek politics now that Syriza is on the backfoot,” he said.

U.S. signs new security pact with Papua New Guinea amid competition with China,Associated Press,"May 22, 2023, 10:27 AM UTC",World,"The United States signed a new security pact with Papua New Guinea on Monday as it competes with China for influence in the Pacific. Papua New Guinea’s location just north of Australia makes it strategically significant. It was the site of fierce battles during World War II, and with a population of nearly 10 million people, it’s the most populous Pacific Island nation. The State Department said the new agreement provides a framework to help improve security cooperation, enhance the capacity of Papua New Guinea’s defense force and increase regional stability. The full agreement will be made public once politicians in both countries have an opportunity for input, likely in a couple of months. At a breakfast meeting, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape said his country faces significant security challenges, from skirmishes within the country to illegal fishing boats that light up the night like skyscrapers. “We have our internal security as well as our sovereignty security issues,” Marape said. “We’re stepping up on that front to make sure our borders are secure.” But the agreement sparked student protests in the second-largest city, Lae. And many in the Pacific are concerned about the increasing militarization of the region. Student Naomi Kipoi, 17, said she was opposed to the security pact because she felt it means the U.S. could come to her country whenever it pleased without permission. She said China had been a big help to her country by building roads and funding schools. “The U.S. didn’t help us with aid and other things,” Kipoi said. “They’re just trying to sign the agreement.” Last year, nearby Solomon Islands signed its own security pact with China, a move that raised alarm throughout the Pacific. The U.S. has increased its focus on the Pacific, opening embassies in Solomon Islands and Tonga, reviving Peace Corps volunteer efforts, and encouraging more business investment. But some have questioned how reliable a partner the U.S. is in the Pacific, particularly after President Joe Biden canceled his plans to make an historic stop in Papua New Guinea to sign the pact. Biden would have been the first sitting U.S. president to visit any Pacific Island country, but he ended up canceling to focus on the debt limit talks back at home. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled in Biden’s place, arriving in Papua New Guinea early Monday. In response to news of Blinken’s impending visit, China warned against the introduction of “geopolitical games” into the region. As well as the defense pact, the U.S. also signed a maritime agreement with Papua New Guinea which will allow the U.S. Coast Guard to partner with the Pacific nation to counter illegal fishing and drug smuggling. The U.S. visit coincided with a trip by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was hosting a meeting with Pacific Island leaders to discuss ways to better cooperate. Blinken met with New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and said the two nations had a shared vision for the region. “To make sure that it remains free, open, secure and prosperous,” Blinken said. Hipkins told Blinken he was very happy that Blinken had made the trip. “The increased U.S. presence in the Pacific is something we welcome,” Hipkins said. But Hipkins also drew a distinction to his own nation’s efforts. “We are not interested in the militarization of the Pacific,” Hipkins told reporters before the Blinken meeting. “We are interested in working with the Pacific on issues where we have mutual interest. Issues around climate change. And we’re not going to be attaching military strings to that support.” Hipkins was one of the few leaders to venture out publicly. He got a rapturous reception from hundreds of well-wishers when he visited Gordons Market, a large fruit and vegetable market. "
Comedian Uncle Roger silenced on Chinese social media after jokes about China,Associated Press,"May 22, 2023, 9:57 AM UTC",World,"A Malaysian comedian better known for mocking attempts by Western chefs at Asian cooking has had his Chinese social media account suspended after making jokes about China. Nigel Ng, who uses the name Uncle Roger, is the latest comedian to feel the consequences of jokes that could be perceived as reflecting negatively on China under increasingly intense censorship and rising nationalism. Last week, a Chinese comedian came under police investigation for a joke about stray dogs. Ng posted a video clip last Thursday from an upcoming comedy special in which he pokes fun at Chinese surveillance and Beijing’s claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. The video shows Ng interacting with someone in the audience who said he is from Guangzhou, a metropolis in China’s south. “Good country, good country, we have to say that now, correct?” Ng says. “All the phones listening.” Ng then jokes with members of the audience who said they’re from Taiwan, a self-governed island claimed by China, saying Taiwan is not a real country. “I hope one day you rejoin the motherland. One China,” he said. His Weibo account said on Monday that he was banned from posting for “violating relevant laws and regulations.” Ng’s agency did not respond to a request for comment. A Chinese comedian, meanwhile, could face jail time as police and government departments investigate him for a joke he made at a performance earlier in May. Beijing police announced last Wednesday that they were investigating comedian Li Haoshi “for severely insulting” the People’s Liberation Army. The comedian, who goes by the stage name HOUSE, made a joke about stray dogs by riffing on a well-known propaganda slogan used to describe the Chinese military. Li said he had adopted two dogs who were very energetic when they went after squirrels, shooting off like artillery shells after a target. Usually, he said, dogs are cute and melt your heart, but when he sees his two dogs, he thinks of the Chinese phrase, “Able to win battles, with first-rate style.” The phrase was first used 10 years ago by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to describe planned reforms for the Chinese military, according to the China Media Project, which studies Chinese media. A government department known as Beijing’s Comprehensive Team of Law Enforcement on Cultural Market said in a statement last week it had received tips from the public about Li’s performance on May 13 and in response launched an investigation into the company Li is signed with. The law enforcement team said it would fine the company, Xiao Guo Wenhua, about $2 million (13.3 million yuan). The company did not respond to a request for comment. An officer who did not give his name at Beijing’s police headquarters declined to say whether Li was under detention or arrest, saying the investigation was continuing and the results would be publicized accordingly.

Meta fined a record $1.3 billion over E.U. user data transfers to the U.S.,"Arjun Kharpal, CNBC","May 22, 2023, 9:40 AM UTC",World,"Meta has been fined a record 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) by European privacy regulators over the transfer of European Union user data to the U.S. The decision links back to a case brought by Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems who argued that the framework for transferring EU citizen data to America did not protect Europeans from U.S. surveillance. Several mechanisms to legally transfer personal data between the U.S. and the EU have been contested. The latest such iteration, Privacy Shield, was struck down by the European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court, in 2020. The Irish Data Protection Commission that overseas Meta operations in the EU alleged that the company infringed the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when it continued to send the personal data of European citizens to the U.S despite the 2020 European court ruling. GDPR is the EU’s landmark data protection regulation that governs firms active in the bloc. It came into effect in 2018. Meta used a mechanism called standard contractual clauses to transfer personal data in and out of the EU. This was not blocked by any court of the EU. The Irish data watchdog said that the clauses were adopted by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, in conjunction with other measures implemented by Meta. However, the regulator said these arrangements “did not address the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects that were identified” by the European Court of Justice. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission also told Meta to “suspend any future transfer of personal data to the US within the period of five months” from the decision. The 1.2 billion euro punishment for Meta is the highest any company has ever been fined for breaching GDPR. The previous largest fine was a 746 million euros charge for e-commerce giant Amazon for breaching GDPR in 2021. Meta said it would appeal the decision and the fine. “We are appealing these decisions and will immediately seek a stay with the courts who can pause the implementation deadlines, given the harm that these orders would cause, including to the millions of people who use Facebook every day,” Nick Clegg, Meta president of global affairs, and Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer at the company, said in a blog post on Monday. The Meta case has put focus back on the EU and Washington’s push to get a new data transfer mechanism agreed. The U.S. and EU last year “in principle” agreed to a new framework for cross-border data transfers. However, the new pact has not yet come into effect. Meta is hoping that this EU-U.S. data privacy agreement is instated before the Irish regulator’s deadlines come in place. If the new framework “comes into effect before the implementation deadlines expire, our services can continue as they do today without any disruption or impact on users,” Clegg and Newstead said. "
Jennifer Lawrence-produced Afghan documentary premieres at Cannes,Reuters,"May 22, 2023, 9:02 AM UTC",Culture & Trends,"While the world watched Kabul fall and the Taliban surge back to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S. troops, actor Jennifer Lawrence and producer Justine Ciarrocchi were asking themselves what they could do to support women’s rights. “Jen’s first response was to find an Afghan filmmaker and give them a platform,” Ciarrocchi told The Hollywood Reporter. They eventually found director Sahra Mani, whose 2019 documentary “A Thousand Girls Like Me” looked at a sexually abused woman’s quest for justice. On Sunday, “Bread and Roses,” Mani’s documentary about the daily lives of three women after the Taliban’s resurgence, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in a special screening. “This film has a message from women in Afghanistan, a soft message; please be their voice who are voiceless under Taliban dictatorship,” said Mani at the premiere. The director said in an interview on the Cannes website that she wanted to show the reality of how drastically life has changed under the Taliban for women, even if filming was difficult. “Now that women can no longer leave the house without the veil, I thought we should tell their stories,” she said. The safety of the camera crews and the people filmed was of top priority, said Mani, who currently lives in France. “The way in which their lives have changed under the Taliban is an everyday reality for us, it’s life under a dictatorship, a cruel reality we cannot ignore.” "

Deep in the woods of eastern Ukraine, the leaves green with the new life of spring, the unit known as On the Shield searches for the country's fallen soldiers. “Our guys are here somewhere,” its team leader, “Mykha,” told NBC News earlier this month. He asked to be identified only by his call sign in accordance with Ukrainian military protocol. The team focused its search near the village of Dovhenke, the scene of a brutal Russian attack in April 2022, two months after President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Burned-out cars and tanks were scattered along parts of the road, and most of the buildings looked as if a wrecking ball had been taken to them. Pockmarks from artillery covered the few that remained standing. At least five soldiers from Ukraine’s 95th Air Assault Brigade that defended the area were still unaccounted for, Mykha said. But each day the team's grisly search becomes more difficult, as spring’s rebirth has covered clues and made graves, once easy to spot during the cold, hard winter, much harder to find. As a result, the bodies that remain from that time are “skeletonized,” said Mykah, adding “any signs such as tattoos or other markings are no longer visible.” The soldiers nonetheless found a military jacket hanging near one of the holes dug by Ukrainian soldiers to sleep in. Other things were clearly Russian, like a “telnyashka,” a blue and white striped undershirt traditionally worn by members of the Russian military. Nearby, a bulletproof vest with Russian writing on it lay on a tree. Mykha said the unit, which is made up of volunteers rather than conscripts, didn’t keep count on the number of Russians it had uncovered, but it had “definitely found several hundred.” “When our troops were advancing, it’s clear the Russian military also left their soldiers because they had no opportunity to take them,” he said. “The very first groups that came in collected them everywhere: on the roads, in houses.” At another site down the road, one of the searchers called out that he'd found bones in a burned-out tank, one of three. One had the letter “Z” painted on the front — a symbol seen on Russian tanks and military vehicles in Ukraine and embraced by supporters of Putin’s war. Pulling on pairs of blue latex gloves, one searcher climbed into the tank closest to the tree line and another mounted the turret as Mykha helped to prepare a body bag. “Is it from the leg or from where?” asked the searcher inside the wreckage as he sifted through the charred debris, occasionally pausing to tap what he found on the side of the tank. Glass and metal sound different to bone, so the team can tell if it's dealing with human remains. “Maybe there is nothing to register,” he said, but later he realized he was sifting through the scene of a tragedy. “He burnt here,” he said, surveying the fragments of what was once a man. “His bones are burnt.” For Mykah and the rest of the On the Shield unit, the man’s nationality is not important. Since they're volunteers and not conscripts, they aim to fulfill one of the oldest military mantras — leave no man behind. “We are now trying to find everyone, because they are going to be exchanged, and every Russian soldier is practically one of our returned soldiers,” Mykha said. “In this case, our military is, of course, the priority,” he said, adding that it was just as important to his team that the relatives of Russian soldiers “seek some peace.” “We have no other choice because we are defending our country, but not all of them probably even understand why they came here,” he said. Their task, while grim, does allow closure for the relatives and friends of the dead. After Yurii Roslov and his unit disappeared on a combat mission toward the end of March 2022, his commander in the 95th Air Assault Brigade, who goes by the call sign “Chef,” said he “hoped that they were captured but there was no news.” Months later, On the Shield found the 26-year-old’s body buried in a shallow grave near Dovhenke village. Around 400 miles away in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv, Roslov’s family could finally lay him to rest on May 6 at the Mis'Ke Kladovyshche Cemetery. As a bugle played his mother wiped away tears, and the priest began to pray. Burying Yurii was “like tearing off a part of myself,” his commander said. “And then you start to live again — somehow — knowing that you won’t see him anymore, that you won’t talk, you won’t hear his songs, you won’t hear the sound of that guitar.” As the final shovel of dirt covers Yurii’s casket, music begins again.

"China tells tech manufacturers to stop using Micron chips, stepping up feud with the U.S.",Associated Press,"May 22, 2023, 8:58 AM UTC",World,"China’s government on Sunday urged owners of computer equipment deemed sensitive to cease purchasing goods from Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. memory chipmaker, in an effort to escalate its dispute with Washington over technology and security. Micron products have unspecified “serious network security risks” that pose hazards to China’s information infrastructure and affect national security, the Cyberspace Administration of China said on its website. Its six-sentence statement gave no details. “Operators of critical information infrastructure in China should stop purchasing products from Micron Co.,” the agency said. The United States, Europe and Japan are reducing Chinese access to advanced chipmaking and other technology they say might be used in weapons at a time when President Xi Jinping’s government has threatened to attack Taiwan and is increasingly assertive toward Japan and other neighbors. Chinese officials have warned of unspecified consequences but appear to be struggling to find ways to retaliate without hurting China’s smartphone producers and other industries and efforts to develop its own processor chip suppliers. An official review of Micron under China’s increasingly stringent information security laws was announced on April 4, hours after Japan joined Washington in imposing restrictions on Chinese access to technology to make processor chips on security grounds. Foreign companies have been rattled by police raids on two consulting firms, Bain & Co. and Capvision, and a due diligence firm, Mintz Group. Chinese authorities have declined to explain the raids but said foreign companies are obliged to obey the law. Business groups and the U.S. government have appealed to authorities to explain the newly expanded legal restrictions on information and how they will be enforced. Sunday’s announcement appeared to try to reassure foreign companies. “China firmly promotes high-level opening up to the outside world and, as long as it complies with Chinese laws and regulations, welcomes enterprises and various platform products and services from various countries to enter the Chinese market,” the cyberspace agency said. Xi accused Washington in March of trying to block China’s development. He called on the public to “dare to fight.” Despite that, Beijing has been slow to retaliate, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries that assemble most of the world’s smartphones, tablet computers and other consumer electronics. They import more than $300 billion worth of foreign chips every year. Beijing is pouring billions of dollars into trying to accelerate chip development and reduce the need for foreign technology. Chinese foundries can supply low-end chips used in cars and home appliances but can’t support smartphones, artificial intelligence and other advanced applications. The conflict has prompted warnings that the world might decouple, or split into separate spheres with incompatible technology standards that mean computers, smartphones and other products from one region wouldn’t work in others. That would raise costs and slow innovation. U.S.-Chinese relations are at their lowest level in decades due to disputes over security, Beijing’s treatment of Hong Kong and Muslim ethnic minorities, territorial disputes and China’s multibillion-dollar trade surpluses.

Beijing hits back at U.S. allies and ‘anti-China’ G-7 summit,Reuters,"May 22, 2023, 8:09 AM UTC",World,"State-backed Chinese mouthpiece Global Times called the Group of Seven summit an “anti-China workshop” on Monday, after Beijing summoned Japan’s envoy and berated Britain in a fiery response to statements issued at the weekend in Hiroshima. A joint communique issued on Saturday singled out China on issues ranging from Taiwan and maritime claims, to economic coercion and human rights, underscoring the tensions between Beijing and the group of rich countries which includes the United States. “The U.S. is pushing hard to weave an anti-China net in the Western world,” Global Times said in an editorial on Monday titled ‘G7 has descended into an anti-China workshop.’ “This is not just a matter of brutal interference in China’s internal affairs and smearing China, but also an undisguised urge for confrontation between the camps”. Beijing’s foreign ministry said it firmly opposed the G-7 statement and late Sunday said it had summoned Japan’s ambassador to China as part of its protest to the summit host. Russia, a close ally of China that was also called out in the G7 statement over its invasion of Ukraine, said the summit was an “incubator” for anti-Russian and anti-Chinese hysteria. Separately, China’s embassy in Britain urged London to stop slandering China on Sunday, after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Beijing represents the world’s greatest challenge to security and prosperity. Despite Beijing’s pointed reaction, President Joe Biden said he expected a thaw in frosty relations with China “very shortly.” The Group of Seven (G7) also includes Canada, France, Germany and Italy. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong summoned the Japanese ambassador to register protests over “hype around China-related issues,” a ministry statement late on Sunday said. Sun said Japan collaborated with the other countries at the G7 summit “in activities and joint declarations ... to smear and attack China, grossly interfering in China’s internal affairs, violating the basic principles of international law and the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan,” referring to the China-Japan Joint Statement of 1972. He said Japan’s actions were detrimental to China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and that China is “strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes” them. “Japan should correct its understanding of China, grasp strategic autonomy, adhere to the principles of the four political documents between China and Japan, and truly promote the stable development of bilateral relations with a constructive attitude,” Sun said. Hideo Tarumi, Japanese ambassador to China, rebutted that it is “natural” for the G-7 to refer to issues of common concern as it has done in the past and will continue to do so in the future as long as China does not change its behavior, according to a readout. “China should first take positive steps to address those issues of concerns if China demands not to refer to them,” Tarumi told Sun, according to the readout. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said during Monday morning briefing that the country’s policy toward China has been consistent that it will insist on matters that is needed and urge responsible behavior, while take steps to address concerns and cooperate on common issues.

3 Palestinians killed in Israeli raid in occupied West Bank; U.S. slams latest settlement expansion,Associated Press,"May 22, 2023, 7:59 AM UTC",World,"Three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli army raid in a West Bank refugee camp early on Monday, Palestinian health officials said, while the Biden administration sharply condemned Israel’s latest act of settlement expansion. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, the three men were killed during a raid in Balata, a refugee camp near the city of Nablus. Six people were wounded, including one who was in critical condition, the ministry said. The army later confirmed soldiers had raided Balata; it said troops came under fire and killed three Palestinians. Israel has stepped up raids in response to a spate of Palestinian attacks and said Monday’s operations netted weapons and an explosives manufacturing operation in a home, which it detonated. Meanwhile, the Biden administration issued a sharply worded statement on Sunday criticizing Israel for moving to reestablish settlers at the formerly evacuated outpost of Homesh in northern West Bank. In March, the Israeli government repealed a 2005 act that dismantled four West Bank settlements. Over the weekend, the top Israeli army general in the West Bank signed an order attaching Homesh to a local settler regional council — a move paving the way for reconstruction of the outpost. The United States was “deeply troubled” by what U.S. State Department spokesman Mathew Miller said was Israel’s illegal policy on the outpost in the occupied territory. Miller also expressed Washington’s concerns about ultranationalist National Security Minister Itmar Ben-Gvir’s visit to the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. The contested site is also home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. “This holy space should not be used for political purposes, and we call on all parties to respect its sanctity,” Miller said in the statement. Under longstanding arrangements, Jews are permitted to visit the site, but not to pray there. But in recent years, a growing number of Jewish visitors have begun to quietly pray, raising fears among Palestinians that Israel is plotting to divide or take over the site. Ben-Gvir has long called for increased Jewish access. Ben-Gvir visited the hilltop compound earlier on Sunday, declaring that “we are in charge,” while the Israeli Cabinet held a rare meeting in Jerusalem’s Old City to celebrate its control of the area. Ben-Gvir’s visit drew condemnations from the Palestinians and Israel’s neighbor, Jordan. Ben-Gvir, a former West Bank settler leader and far-right activist who years ago was convicted of incitement and supporting a Jewish terror group, now serves as Israel’s national security minister, overseeing the country’s police force. More than 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the spring of 2022. About 50 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis. Israel says most of the Palestinians killed were militants, but stone throwing youths protesting the incursions and people not involved in the confrontations have also been killed. Last week, Israelis marked Jerusalem Day, which celebrates Israel’s capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war. Flag-waving nationalists marched through the main Palestinian thoroughfare in Jerusalem’s Old City, some singing racist anti-Arab chants, while hundreds of Jews visited the sensitive hilltop shrine. Israel also captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for a future independent state, with east Jerusalem as its capital. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move unrecognized by most of the international community and considers the city its undivided, permanent capital. Tensions at the disputed compound have fueled past rounds of violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, the most right-wing in Israeli history, includes ultra-Orthodox and far-right nationalist parties and has made West Bank settlement construction a top priority. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements, home to 700,000 people in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, to be illegal and obstacles to peace. Earlier this month, fighting also erupted between Israel and militants in the Gaza Strip. Israeli strikes killed 33, many of them militants but also women and children. Two people were killed in Israel by militant rocket fire. "
Greece votes in first election since international bailout spending controls ended,Associated Press,"May 21, 2023, 3:50 PM UTC",World,"Greeks were voting Sunday in the first election since their country’s economy ceased to be subject to strict supervision and control by international lenders who had provided bailout funds during its nearly decade-long financial crisis. The vote pitches conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, 55, a Harvard-educated former banking executive, against 48-year-old Alexis Tsipras, who heads the left-wing Syriza party and served as prime minister during some of the financial crisis’ most turbulent years, as the two main contenders. Mitsotakis has repeatedly stressed that he needs a second term to build on what he says he accomplished during the first. He pressed the same line when he talked to media after casting his vote. “Today, we vote for our future, for higher wages, for more and better jobs. We vote for a more effective public health system, for a fairer society, for a stronger country, which plays an important role in Europe, with protected borders.” Tsipras, unsurprisingly, painted a bleaker picture of the present government’s record and emphasized the need for change. “Today is a day of hope. The citizens have in their hands the possibility ... to change the course of the country, to leave behind a difficult four years of inequalities, injustice, profiteering, job insecurity, auctions, indignity for pensioners, the targeting of the youth. To leave behind an arrogant government that does not feel the needs of the many,” he said, also promising “a new ethos and style of governance.” The rising cost of living was at the forefront of many voters’ minds as they headed to polling centers set up in schools across the country. “Every year, instead of improving, things are getting worse,” said Athens resident Dimitris Hondrogiannis, 54, “Things are expensive. Every day, things are getting out of control. It’s enough to make you afraid to go to the supermarket to shop. ” Hondrogiannis said he hoped for a stable government that would help reduce prices for food and general goods. “People cannot make ends meet,” he said. Although Mitsotakis has been steadily ahead in opinion polls, a newly introduced electoral system of proportional representation makes it unlikely that whoever wins the election will be able to garner enough seats in Greece’s 300-member parliament to form a government without seeking coalition partners. The winner of Sunday’s election will have three days to negotiate a coalition with other parties. If that fails, the mandate to form a government passes to the second party and the process is repeated; in case of failure the third-place party also gets a chance. But deep divisions between the two main parties and four smaller ones expected to enter parliament mean a coalition will be hard to come by, making a second election likely, probably on July 2. The second election would be held under a new electoral law which makes it easier for a winning party to form a government by giving it a bonus of up to 50 seats in parliament, calculated on a sliding scale depending on the percentage of votes won. A total of 32 parties are running, although opinion polls have indicated only six have a realistic chance of meeting the 3% threshold to gain seats in parliament. Greece’s once-dominant socialist Pasok party is likely to be at the center of any coalition talks. Overtaken by Syriza during Greece’s 2009-2018 financial crisis, the party has been polling at around 10%. Its leader, Nikos Androulakis, 44, was at the center of a wiretapping scandal in which his phone was targeted for surveillance. Pasok would be vital in any coalition deal, but Androulakis’ poor relationship with Mitsotakis, who he accuses of covering up the wiretapping scandal, mean a deal with the conservatives is unlikely. His relationship with Tsipras is also poor, accusing him of trying to poach Pasok voters. The far-right Greeks Party, founded by a jailed former lawmaker with a history of neo-Nazi activity, was banned from participating by the Supreme Court. His former party, Golden Dawn, which rose to become Greece’s third largest during the financial crisis, was deemed to be a criminal organization. In the run-up to the election, Mitsotakis had enjoyed a double-digit lead in opinion polls, but saw that erode following a rail disaster on Feb. 28 that killed 57 people after an intercity passenger train was accidentally put on the same rail line as an oncoming freight train. The government was also battered by a surveillance scandal in which journalists and prominent Greek politicians, including Androulakis, discovered spyware on their phones. Tsipras has campaigned heavily on the rail disaster and the wiretapping scandal. In power since 2019, Mitsotakis has delivered unexpectedly high growth, a steep drop in unemployment and a country on the brink of returning to investment grade on the global bond market for the first time since it lost market access in 2010, at the start of its financial crisis. Debts to the International Monetary Fund were paid off early. European governments and the IMF pumped 280 billion euros ($300 billion) into the Greek economy in emergency loans between 2010 and 2018 to prevent the eurozone member from bankruptcy. In return, they demanded punishing cost-cutting measures and reforms that saw the country’s economy shrink by a quarter. A severe recession and years of emergency borrowing left Greece with a whopping national debt that reached 400 billion euros last December and hammered household incomes, which will likely need another decade to recover. The other three parties with realistic chances of parliamentary seats are Greece’s Communist Party, or KKE, led by Dimitris Koutsoumbas; the left-wing European Realistic Disobedience front (MeRA25), led by Tsipras’ flamboyant former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis; and the right-wing Elliniki Lysi, or Greek Solution, headed by Kyriakos Velopoulos. The KKE, a staple of Greek politics, has seen a steady core of support around 4.5%-5.5% over the past decade, while Varoufakis’ party has been polling at just over the 3% parliamentary threshold. Velopoulos’ party elected 10 lawmakers in 2019 and looks set to enter parliament again. "
"Bakhmut echoes Hiroshima, Zelenskyy says as he thanks G7 for F-16 fighters",Leila Sackur,"May 21, 2023, 3:48 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew parallels between the horror of Hiroshima and the destruction of the city of Bakhmut at the Group of Seven summit in Japan on Sunday. After Russia said it was in full control of battle-scarred Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine — a claim denied by Zelenskyy — the Ukrainian leader said it was unfair to compare Bakhmut to the first city to suffer a nuclear attack. But speaking in Hiroshima, which hosted the three-day summit for the leaders of the world's seven largest economies, he said photos of the city where the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb in 1945 “absolutely remind me of Bakhmut and other cities like it.” He said there was “absolutely, nothing alive there, all buildings are destroyed, there is even no understanding where a street is and where a building is. Absolute total destruction. Nothing left, no people left.” Today, he said Hiroshima was “a modern city that looks alive, with respect to people and values,” adding that he believed the same would happen in Bakhmut and other towns and villages. Zelenskyy hadn’t been expected to appear at the summit in person, but after he arrived on a French plane Saturday dressed in his signature green military fatigues, he was warmly welcomed by the other leaders, including President Joe Biden, whom he met with on Sunday. He said that Ukraine was expecting to receive “high-quality weapons” from all countries in the G7, which includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States. “We will get the jets,” he said. “So far, I cannot say how many of them, this is not a secret, I truly don’t know that yet.” His comments came after Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose fighters led the costly Russian push for Bakhmut, claimed Saturday to have finally captured the city. Russia’s Defense Ministry also said in a Telegram post that the city’s “liberation” had been completed. Disputing the claims, Zelenskyy said his forces were “holding on” and “fighting thanks to courage of our people and warriors, and thanks to our intelligence.” Moscow focused on seizing Bakhmut over the winter in the hopes of a much needed success that could also serve as a stepping stone to the rest of the surrounding industrial heartland known as the Donbas. Ukraine sought to wear down Russian forces by forcing a protracted fight that turned into the longest and bloodiest of the war, buying time for its military to prepare a crucial counteroffensive. On Sunday, Zelenskyy refused to provide details on where Ukraine would strike. “Russia will feel when a counteroffensive takes place,” he said. "
At least 12 dead in crush at soccer stadium in El Salvador,Associated Press,"May 21, 2023, 4:47 AM UTC / Updated May 21, 2023, 2:08 PM UTC",Latin America,"SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — At least 12 people were killed and 100 more injured when soccer fans pushed through one of the access gates at a quarterfinal match in the Salvadoran league Saturday. The National Civil Police said in a preliminary report via Twitter that nine dead were confirmed at the match between clubs Alianza and FAS at Monumental stadium in Cuscatlan, which is about 25 miles northeast of the capital. Authorities issued an update on Sunday that four more people died in the incident, all of whom were adults. An estimated 100 people were transported to medical centers in serious condition, officials said Sunday. Carlos Fuentes, spokesman for the first aid group Rescue Commandos, also confirmed the initial deaths, seven men and two women. Fuentes said that the group attended to more than 500 people. Play was suspended about 16 minutes into the match, when fans in the stands waving frantically began getting the attention of those on the field and carrying the injured out of a tunnel and down to the pitch. Local television transmitted live images of the aftermath of the crush by Alianza fans. Dozens made it onto the field where they received medical treatment. Fans who escaped the crush stood on the field furiously waving shirts attempting to review people lying on the grass barely moving. Pedro Hernández, president of El Salvador soccer’s first division, said the preliminary information he had was that the crush occurred because fans managed to push through a gate into the stadium. National Civil Police Commissioner Mauricio Arriza Chicas, at the scene of the tragedy, said there would be a criminal investigation in conjunction with the Attorney General’s Office. “We are going to investigate from the ticket sales, the entries into the stadium, but especially the southern zone,” where, he said, the gate was pushed open. The Salvadoran Soccer Federation said in a statement that it regretted what had happened and voiced support for the victims’ families. Matches were suspended for Sunday and the sport's officials scheduled a meeting Sunday morning to address the crush, according to a translated tweet from the federation. "
Pakistani trans activists to appeal Shariah court ruling against law aimed at protecting them,Associated Press,"May 21, 2023, 9:25 AM UTC",World,"Transgender activists in Pakistan said they plan to appeal to the highest court in the land an Islamic court’s ruling that guts a law aimed at protecting their rights. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act was passed by Parliament in 2018 to secure the fundamental rights of transgender Pakistanis. It ensures their access to legal gender recognition, among other rights. Many Pakistanis have entrenched beliefs on gender and sexuality and transgender people are often considered outcasts. Some are forced into begging, dancing and even prostitution to earn money. They also live in fear of attacks. The Federal Shariat Court on Friday struck down several provisions of the landmark law, terming them “un-Islamic.” It ruled that a person cannot change their gender on the basis of “innermost feeling” or “self-perceived identity” and must conform to the biological sex assigned to them at the time of birth. The Shariah court has the constitutional mandate of examining and determining whether laws passed by Pakistan’s parliament comply with Islamic doctrine. Around a dozen activists protested in the southern port city of Karachi on Saturday against the ruling. Lawyer Sara Malkani, who was speaking at an event organized by the Gender Interactive Alliance, denied the legislation was un-Islamic. She said the existence of two genders did not limit the concept of gender identity and that Islamic texts, including the Quran, did not associate specific behavior to specific genders. “We absolutely intend to appeal the court’s findings to the Supreme Court, and we will prevail,” said Nayyab Ali, executive director of Transgender Rights Consultants Pakistan, at a news conference Friday. Ali said the transgender community was “mourning the decimation” of Pakistan’s first transgender rights protection legislation in response to the Islamic court’s finding. However, clerics and representatives from religious parties say the law has the potential to promote homosexuality in this conservative country with a Muslim majority. They want the Islamic court to annul the law. The Shariah court ruled that the term “transgender” as it is used in the law creates confusion. It covers several biological variations, including intersex, transgender men, transgender women and Khawaja Sira, a Pakistani term commonly used for those who were born male but identify as female. It also rejected a clause in the law in which the country’s national database and registration authority permits the change of a person’s biological gender from the one they were assigned at birth in identification documents including drivers licenses and passports. It said permitting any person to change their gender in accordance with his or her inner feeling or self-perceived identity will create “serious religious, legal and social problems.” For example it will allow a transgender woman — a person who is biologically male — to access social and religious gatherings of females or women-only public places, and vice versa, it said. “This law will pave the way for criminals in society to easily commit crimes like sexual molestation, sexual assault and even rape against females in the disguise of a transgender woman,” the court ruled. However, the court said Islamic law recognizes the existence of intersex people and eunuchs and said they should be entitled to all the fundamental rights provided to Pakistanis in the constitution. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed dismay over the “regressive ruling” and said the denial of transgender people’s rights to self-perceived gender identity seeks the “erasure of an entire demographic and its fundamental rights.” It said rolling back the transgender bill will lead to further marginalization and abuse of an already vulnerable community in Pakistan. Amnesty International called on the government to stop any attempts to prevent transgender people from obtaining official documents reflecting their gender identity without complying with abusive and invasive requirements. “This verdict is a blow to the rights of the already beleaguered group of transgender and gender-diverse people in Pakistan,” said Rehab Mahamoor, research assistant at Amnesty International, in a statement. She said any steps to deny transgender and gender-diverse people the right to determine their own gender identity would violate international human rights law. Sana, 40, a eunuch in Rawalpindi who asked to be identified by one name, told The Associated Press on Saturday that she favored the court’s ruling because a large number of gay men were being included in her “original and by-birth” eunuch community. She alleged that those who become transgender men through surgical castration are “denying the rights” of her community by affecting their access to employment opportunities under the government’s job quota reserved for their community.

China and Ukraine force rivals Japan and South Korea to rethink,Alexander Smith,"May 21, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",World,"The United States and its allies hoped to showcase their “commitment to peace” at the Group of Seven summit this weekend  in Hiroshima, the Japanese city rebuilt from the irradiated ashes of an American atom bomb. But host Japan is increasingly stepping beyond the boundaries set by its history and playing a more assertive role on the world stage. It’s not the only one, as some experts say North Korea’s escalating nuclear threats and worries over China’s sweeping territorial claims that have been sharpened by Russia’s war in Ukraine are pushing Washington’s friends in the region to embrace a more aggressive approach to security — and embrace each other. Historically bitter enemies, Japan and South Korea are each host to tens of thousands of American troops and both are now seeking to build up their militaries and their cooperation. The Chinese government has condemned what it views as smaller countries in its backyard toadying up to their benefactor in Washington. By contrast, this development is music to the ears of the White House, which has long called for countries to join its geopolitical struggle against what it sees as Beijing’s nefarious rise. “The United States has pressured its Asian allies to turn the page on history and cooperate on containing China while dealing with the threat from Pyongyang,” Jeff Kingston, a professor of history and Asian studies at Temple University, Japan Campus, told NBC News. This all came ahead of the annual summit of G7 leaders, which runs Friday to Sunday. This is an informal club of rich democracies — the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Japan — which meet each year to discuss global politics. This time it’s being hosted in Hiroshima, “a city which has recovered from the catastrophic damage by an atomic bomb and which continues to seek lasting world peace,” according to the summit’s website. This makes it “the most fitting location to express” the G7’s “commitment to peace.” Top of the agenda is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, whose President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an in-person appearance at the summit to rally support. On Friday, the group’s leaders made the direct connection between the city’s history and Russia’s nuclear threats, which have helped drive Japan’s push to make arms control  a major part of the gathering. “We reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible,” they said in a joint statement. But close behind that grinding conflict is how to approach China, with allies still somewhat divided on how to balance cooperation economically with confrontation on China’s alleged human rights abuses, authoritarianism and territorial expansionism. The Kremlin’s war has sharpened minds in Asia about what would happen if China invaded Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing sees as rightfully its territory. “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told another summit in Singapore last June. Some experts believe that, although North Korea's nuclear arsenal is seen as the most pressing threat in Seoul, growing concern about China has emerged as another factor behind a rapprochement between Japan and South Korea that comes as both countries embrace a more hawkish approach to defense.

Extremist Israeli Cabinet minister visits sensitive Jerusalem holy site,Associated Press,"May 21, 2023, 8:42 AM UTC",World,"An extremist Israeli Cabinet minister visited a sensitive Jerusalem holy site on Sunday at a time of heightened tensions with the Palestinians. The visit by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, his second known visit since becoming a member of Israel’s most right-leaning government ever, drew condemnations from the Palestinians and Israel’s neighbor Jordan, which acts as the custodian of the site. “I am happy to come up to the Temple Mount, the most important place for the Israeli people,” Ben-Gvir said during his early morning visit to the site, with the golden Dome of the Rock in the background, according to video released by his office. He praised the police presence at the site, saying it “proves who is in charge in Jerusalem.” Palestinian presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh called Ben-Gvir’s visit a “blatant attack” on the mosque. Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it “a provocative step that is condemned, and a dangerous and unacceptable escalation.” The visit comes days after Israelis marked Jerusalem Day, which celebrates Israel’s capturing of east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. Flag-waving nationalists marched through the main Palestinian thoroughfare in Jerusalem’s Old City, some singing racist anti-Arab chants, while hundreds of Jews visited the sensitive hilltop shrine, including a low-level minister from Ben-Gvir’s party, but not Ben-Gvir himself. Later on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet is expected to hold a special session to mark the occasion near the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray and a remaining exterior wall of the biblical Temples. Known to Jews as the Temple Mount, the hilltop site is the holiest in Judaism and home to the ancient biblical Temples. Today, it houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. Since Israel captured the site in 1967, Jews have been allowed to visit but not pray there. The ultranationalist Ben-Gvir, along with a growing movement of activists, has long called for greater Jewish access to the holy site. Palestinians consider the mosque a national symbol and view such visits as provocative and as a potential precursor to Israel seizing control over the compound. Most rabbis forbid Jews from praying at the site, but there has been a growing movement in recent years of Jews who support worship there. Tensions at the disputed compound have fueled past rounds of violence. A visit by then-opposition leader Ariel Sharon in September 2000 helped spark clashes that became the second Palestinian uprising. Clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian demonstrators in and around the site fueled an 11-day war with Hamas in 2021. Israel captured the Old City of Jerusalem, with its sites holy to three monotheistic faiths, along with the rest of east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for a future independent state, with east Jerusalem as capital. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move unrecognized by most of the international community and considers the city its undivided, eternal capital. Violence between Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank has spiked in the last year, as Israel launched near-nightly raids in response to a spate of Palestinian attacks. More than 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the spring of 2022. About 50 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis. Israel says most of the Palestinians killed were militants, but stone throwing youths protesting the incursions and people not involved in the confrontations have also been killed. Earlier this month, fighting also erupted between Israel and militants in the Gaza Strip. Israeli strikes killed 33, many of them militants but also women and children, and two people were killed in Israel by militant rocket fire. "
"Russian forces claim full control of Bakhmut, ending brutal battle that became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance",Mithil Aggarwal,"May 21, 2023, 6:24 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"Russian forces have claimed full control of Bakhmut, ending an intense monthslong battle for the eastern city that came to embody Ukrainian resistance. The news will serve as a symbolic boost for Russian President Vladimir Putin, but his first major battlefield victory in nearly a year may be a fleeting one, with his military forced onto the backfoot around the city and beyond. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has spent the weekend rallying support from world leaders, was asked about the city's status ahead of a meeting with President Joe Biden at the G7 summit in Japan. Asked if the city was under Russian control he said, “I think no, but you have to understand there is nothing. They destroyed our city. There are no buildings. It’s a pity, a tragedy but for today Bakhmut is only in our hearts. There is nothing of this place, just ground and a lot of dead Russians.” He added that Ukrainian defenders “did strong work in the city.” Zelenskyy's spokesman, Sergii Nykyforov, later clarified on Facebook that his’ “no” was referring to Russia’s assertion that it had taken the city. Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose fighters led the costly Russian push for the city, claimed Saturday to have finally captured it. Russia’s Defense Ministry also said in a Telegram post that the city’s “liberation” had been completed. A statement posted to the Russian president’s website on Sunday said Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner forces and the military “on the completion of the operation,” to liberate the city. After a litany of setbacks, Moscow focused on seizing Bakhmut over the winter in the hopes of a much needed success that could also serve as a stepping stone to the rest of the surrounding industrial heartland known as the Donbas. Ukraine sought to wear down Russian forces by forcing a protracted fight that turned into the longest and bloodiest of the war, buying time for its military to prepare a crucial counteroffensive. In recent days Kyiv's troops have clawed back ground on the city’s flanks, exposing bitter divisions between the Kremlin’s military leaders, and leading an angry Prigozhin to say his troops inside the city were at risk of encirclement. The city's symbolic weight had grown with each day that Ukrainian defenders held out against waves of Russian attacks. That resistance became a point of national pride, with the phrase ""Bakhmut holds"" becoming a daily patriotic rallying cry. It holds no longer, but Kyiv may believe it has served its purpose. "
"Warring factions in Sudan agree to temporary ceasefire, U.S.-Saudi mediators say",The Associated Press,"May 21, 2023, 1:24 AM UTC",World,"WASHINGTON — Sudan’s warring factions have agreed to a new short-term ceasefire, U.S. and Saudi mediators announced on Saturday, after several previous attempts to broker a truce that holds have failed. Meeting in the Saudi port city of Jeddah, the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces signed off on a seven-day ceasefire that is due to take effect on Monday 9:45 p.m. local time in Sudan, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement. The ceasefire could be extended if both sides agree. “Both parties have conveyed to the Saudi and U.S. facilitators their commitment not to seek military advantage during the 48-hour notification period after signing the agreement and prior to the start of the ceasefire,” it said. The talks in Jeddah had previously produced an agreement between the two sides on protecting civilians and easing the flow of humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict. But, earlier ceasefire deals have foundered amid accusations by both of violations. “It is well known that the parties have previously announced ceasefires that have not been observed,” the U.S.-Saudi statement said. “Unlike previous ceasefires, the Agreement reached in Jeddah was signed by the parties and will be supported by a U.S.-Saudi and international-supported ceasefire monitoring mechanism.” The Monitoring and Coordination Committee is to be made up of three representatives each from the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and three representatives from each party.

British novelist Martin Amis dies at 73,The Associated Press,"May 21, 2023, 12:54 AM UTC",Obituaries,"NEW YORK — British novelist Martin Amis, who brought a rock ‘n’ roll sensibility to his stories and lifestyle, has died. He was 73. His death on Friday at his home in Florida, from cancer of the esophagus, was confirmed by his agent, Andrew Wylie, on Saturday. Amis was the son of another British writer, Kingsley Amis. Martin Amis was a leading voice among a generation of writers that included his good friend, the late Christopher Hitchens, Ian McEwan and Salman Rushdie. Among his best-known works were “Money,” a satire about consumerism in London, “The Information” and “London Fields,” along with his 2000 memoir, “Experience.” Jonathan Glazer’s adaption of Amis’ 2014 novel “The Zone of Interest” premiered Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival. The film, about a Nazi commandant who lives next to Auschwitz with his family, drew some of the best reviews of the festival. The Holocaust was the topic of Amis’ novel “Time’s Arrow” and Josef Stalin’s reign in Russia in “House of Meetings,” examples of how his writing explored the dark soul. “Violence is what I hate most, is what baffles me and disgusts me most,” Amis told The Associated Press in 2012. “Writing comes from silent anxiety, the stuff you don’t know you’re really brooding about and when you start to write you realize you have been brooding about it, but not consciously. It’s terribly mysterious.” Amis was a celebrity in his own right, his life often chronicled by London tabloids since his 1973 debut, “The Rachel Papers.” His love life, his change of agents, even his dental work were fodder for stories. “He was the king — a stylist extraordinaire, super cool, a brilliantly witty, erudite and fearless writer and a truly wonderful man,” said Michal Shavit, his editor in England. “He has been so important and formative for so many readers and writers over the last half century. Every time he published a new book it was an event.” Critic Michiko Kakutani wrote of Amis in The New York Times in 2000 that “he is a writer equipped with a daunting arsenal of literary gifts: a dazzling, chameleonesque command of language, a willingness to tackle large issues and larger social canvases and an unforgiving, heat-seeking eye for the unwholesome ferment of contemporary life.” “We are devastated at the death of our author and friend, Martin Amis,” Amis’ publisher, Penguin, tweeted. “He leaves a towering legacy and an indelible mark on the British cultural landscape, and will be missed enormously.” "
Russia issues retaliatory arrest warrant for International Criminal Court prosecutor,Leila Sackur,"May 20, 2023, 3:52 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"The Kremlin has opened a criminal case against the prosecutor and several judges on the International Criminal Court in an apparent act of retribution for the court issuing an arrest warrant against President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Investigative Committee said in a Telegram post Saturday that British prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan had brought “a knowingly innocent person to criminal liability, combined with the unlawful accusation of a person of committing a grave or especially grave crime.” The statement said Khan, together with judges Tomoko Akane, Rosario Salvatore Aitala and Sergio Gerardo Ugalde Godinez, had “issued unlawful decisions” in arresting President Vladimir Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, his presidential commissioner for children’s rights. “The criminal prosecution is obviously illegal, since there are no grounds for criminal liability,” the statement said, adding that Khan had sought to complicate international relations. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Putin and Lvova-Belova in March for their allegedly overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia. Pretrial judges had assessed that there were ""reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bears individual criminal responsibility” for the deportations, the court said in a statement at the time. Ukraine is not a member of the court, but it has granted it jurisdiction over its territory. After the warrant for Putin was issued, the court said Khan had visited the country four times since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, when he opened his investigation into attacks against critical civilian infrastructure and residential buildings, and the alleged deportations. The U.S. does not recognize the court’s jurisdiction, and Moscow formally withdrew its signature from its founding statute in November 2016, a day after the court published a report classifying its annexation of Crimea as an occupation. Issuing the arrest warrant for Putin was a largely symbolic move designed to compel countries that recognize the court's jurisdiction to surrender the Russian president to the court if he entered their territory. In actuality, however, it remains unlikely that Putin will be arrested given the international principles of immunity from arrest that exist for presiding heads of state. It is also unlikely that Khan will be arrested. From the early days of the Ukraine invasion last February, Kyiv has accused Moscow of forcibly transferring children and adults into Russian territory. Russian officials have consistently denied the accusations, calling them a “fantasy” aimed at discrediting Moscow. The Russian Embassy in the United States said in February that the country had taken in children who were forced to flee the fighting. The United Nations has also led inquiries into Russian attacks against civilians in Ukraine, including systematic torture and killing in occupied regions, and cited these as among potential issues that amount to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity. The Russian Investigative Committee’s announcement came the day after the country’s Foreign Ministry banned 500 Americans from Russia, including former President Barack Obama. It came in response to the latest round of 300 U.S. sanctions against individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft to “extensively [restrict] categories of goods key to the battlefield.” "
Russia and Cuba ink deals to revitalize island’s ailing economy,Reuters,"May 20, 2023, 2:29 PM UTC",World,"Russian officials and business leaders have signed multiple deals with Cuban counterparts at a forum in Havana this week, agreeing to work together to boost sugar and rum output, assure wheat and crude oil supply to the communist-run island, and overhaul crumbling tourist facilities. The longtime political allies — both subject to U.S. sanctions — are seeking to cement economic ties by facilitating trade and investment. The deals “constitute a milestone in the history of our bilateral and business ties,” said Ricardo Cabrisas, Cuba’s foreign trade minister, in a speech closing the forum on Friday. The agreements include a contract for Russia’s Prodintorg to supply wheat to Cuba’s state-owned Alimport, aimed at “guaranteeing the stability” of supply to the Cuban population, according to a document from the Cuban-Russian Business Committee viewed by Reuters. Another deal will create a Cuba-based marketplace for Russian goods, including food and home goods, called Rusmarket, which will also help spur development of more direct and fluid shipping routes between the two countries, the document said. A third deal states Russian and Cuban intention to revive the decrepit residential beach community of Tarara, whose white sand beaches just minutes from Havana, the document says, are “ideal for enjoying the ocean, fishing and diving.” Russian deputy prime minister for tourism, sport, culture and communications Dmitry Chernyshenko announced separately on Friday a presidential order to reinstate by July regular flights between Russia and Cuba, suspended since March 2022 due to the conflict in Ukraine. Other agreements announced this week include one aimed at developing a Russian-Cuban rum company, which would seek to boost exports of Cuba’s prized rum. Russia also provided funds, know-how and technology to restart a steel mill in Cuba to supply construction materials on the island, according to Cuba state-run media reports. Top Russian business leaders lauded Cuba earlier this week for opening the door to Russian investors and for providing them with “preferential treatment,” including tariff exemptions, long-term land concessions and ease in repatriating profits. More than 150 Russian businesspeople attended the forum in Havana, according to Cuban officials. Russia this week also promised to help revive Cuba’s once-vaunted sugar industry, which has nearly collapsed in recent years as its production has plunged to historic lows. Aleksandr Bogatyr, of Russia’s Progress Agro, told Reuters on the sidelines of the forum that his firm and Cuban state-run sugar company Azcuba would begin a joint venture as early as next year to overhaul the obsolete “Uruguay” sugar mill in Sancti Spiritus province. The firm hopes to eventually export as much as 150,000 tons of sugar per year, about one-third of this year’s countrywide target. “Cuba was once one of the top producers (of sugar) on the international market and with this project, working together, we hope to gradually lift levels of output,” Bogatyr said. He called the project a Russian investment, but declined to give figures. “It would be a significant investment because we’d bring all of the new equipment and organize the supplies necessary to produce cane, such as fertilizer, and specialized technology,” he said. Bilateral trade between Cuba and Russia reached $450 million in 2022, three times that of 2021, and soared to $137.6 million in the first four months of 2023, nine times that of the same period the previous year, Russian officials said.

G7 leaders discuss China's 'economic coercion' threat,Peter Nicholas,"May 20, 2023, 12:19 PM UTC",World,"HIROSHIMA, Japan — Striking back at China’s aggressive use of economic power, President Joe Biden and leaders of other advanced democracies have been working toward a collective strategy to foil what they say are Beijing's attempts to intimidate businesses and nations for political gain at the Group of Seven summit this weekend. Members have been considering ways to to defend against what they describe as coercive tactics that China deploys for political leverage. Far more than at past G7 summits, the leaders gathered in Hiroshima have devoted attention to an issue they contend is a troubling outgrowth of Beijing’s growing economic might. Heading into meetings Saturday, Biden and his counterparts planned to “outline a common set of tools to address concerns that each of our countries face, including from economic coercion,” Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told reporters. A 41-page summit communiqué released Saturday made overtures to China but also included a vow that “we will foster resilience to economic coercion.” Succinct as it is, the statement showed at least some threshold level of unity when it comes to countering China's economic clout. The communiqué also announced the creation of a new initiative to “increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion.” “There was never a communiqué before that ever mentioned coercion,” Rahm Emanuel, U.S. ambassador to Japan, told NBC News in an interview Friday. “You can’t find it. “Given the frequency with which China turns to this instrument and tool, you can’t just have an ad hoc strategy,” Emanuel added. “You have to have a coordinated strategy that is well thought out, with all the tools available, and you know how to respond.” In a strongly worded response on Saturday, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry accused the G7 of “smearing and attacking China, and grossly interfering in China’s internal affairs. “The G7 talks about ‘moving toward a peaceful, stable and prosperous world,’ but what it does is hinder international peace, damage regional stability and suppress the development of other countries,” the spokesperson said. “Such actions have no international credibility at all.” Reaching any sort of international consensus around China is tricky. The G7 countries are scattered across the globe and have distinct trade and diplomatic relations with Beijing. French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is part of the G7, visited China last month and caused an uproar in the West when he suggested in an interview that France should strive for “strategic autonomy” and resist falling under the sway of either the U.S. or China. “In the run-up to the G7 summit, French officials have complained privately about pressure from the U.S. to get behind a more confrontational approach to Beijing,” Noah Barkin, a senior adviser at the Rhodium Group research firm, wrote in a newsletter. Identifying instances of China’s coercive use of economic power isn’t always easy. “These things are very specific and almost idiosyncratic — case by case — and often difficult to prove,” Thomas Cynkin of the Atlantic Council said in a news briefing, citing an example of banana exports from the Philippines being left to rot on a dock in China and asking whether it was because Beijing was retaliating for some perceived slight or whether it was a simple mistake. Still, experts have been chronicling cases of what they describe as an abuse of China’s outsize influence as the world’s second largest economy. A report in March by the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed to a Taiwanese government office that opened in Lithuania two years ago. China considers Taiwan part of its territory under its “one-China” principle, and opening an office under Taiwan's name ran afoul of a Chinese norm, the report says. The backlash was fierce. After the opening was announced, China rejected permits for Lithuanian food imports, and firms in the eastern European country had difficulty getting Chinese contracts approved, the report said. Last month, China opened a cybersecurity review of Micron Technology, a U.S. memory chip maker. The move was seen as retaliation for the Biden administration’s imposition of export controls aimed at depriving Beijing of computer chips that underpin its military and economic expansion. “They’ve gone from targeting countries to coercing companies,” said Emanuel, a former Chicago mayor and White House chief of staff in the Obama administration. The G7 communiqué does not specify how member countries should parry China. Blunting any punitive action taken by China calls for coordinated action and resolve on the part of the U.S. and its allies, analysts have said. If China were to boycott a certain company, other nations might conceivably respond by stepping in and offering lines of credit so that the business doesn’t collapse. Earlier this year, the European Union reached an agreement that allows retaliatory action against nations that use economic muscle to get other countries to bend to their will. As a deterrent, the E.U. would hit violators with import tariffs, for example. “If you have coordinated, unified, collaborative action, you can beat back economic coercion,” Emanuel said. "
Zelenskyy says peace will become ‘closer’ as he makes dramatic visit to Japan for G7 summit,Peter Nicholas,"May 20, 2023, 10:57 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"HIROSHIMA, Japan — Ukraine’s President Volodomyr Zelenskyy touched down in Japan Saturday for diplomatic talks with the leaders of the seven industrial nations, hours after President Joe Biden and his allies announced a slew of new sanctions designed to impede Russia’s ability to prolong the war. “Important meetings with partners and friends of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy tweeted upon his arrival at Hiroshima Airport on plane provided by France. “Security and enhanced cooperation for our victory. Peace will become closer today.” Wearing his trademark green military fatigues, he shook hands with officials  before he was whisked off to the G7 summit, where he met with several heads of state, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron. He was also expected to meet with President Joe Biden and deliver a speech. Also on the agenda is a tour of a Hiroshima museum dedicated to the atomic bomb attack that leveled the city at the end of World War II. The visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum will likely have special resonance for Zelenskyy, whose small country is at war with a nuclear-armed power. In the run-up to the three-day event, participants had expected the Ukrainian leader to appear at least virtually. Until Friday, there had been no confirmation that Zelenskyy would make the potentially dangerous trip from Kyiv, the farthest he has traveled from his country since last year’s invasion. He landed hours after the U.S. agreed to allow training on American-made F-16 fighter jets, laying the groundwork for their eventual transfer to Ukraine. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan later told reporters in Japan that Biden had shared plans with G7 allies — Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada — to supply the aircraft. “Over the past few months, we and our allies and partners have really focused on providing Ukraine with the systems, weapons and training that it needs to be able to conduct effective offensive operations this spring and summer,” Sullivan said. “We have delivered what we promised, we have given Ukraine what it needs based on close consultations between our military and theirs, and now, we have turned to discussions about improving the Ukrainian air force as part of our long-term commitment to Ukraine self defense.” Sullivan suggested that the fighter jets were part of that commitment, and that as the training unfolds in the coming months, the United States would work with allies to determine details about delivery of the jets, including how many would be sent. The timing for when Ukraine will receive the fighter jets — and which countries will provide them — remains unclear, but a senior Biden administration official told NBC News Friday the planes would not be used for Ukraine’s upcoming counteroffensive against Russia. Sullivan also told reporters that he believed it was “a safe bet” that  Biden would meet with Zelenskyy at the summit. The G7 vowed to intensify the pressure on Russia in a joint statement Saturday. “Russia’s brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace,” it said. Russia is now the most-sanctioned country in the world, and the latest measures aimed at Moscow include tighter restrictions on previously sanctioned people and firms involved in the war effort. “Our support for Ukraine will not waver,” the statement said. The G7 leaders also vowed “to stand together against Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. “Russia started this war and can end this war,” they said. Peter Nicholas reported from Hiroshima and Leila Sackur from London. "
"Russia and China have a troubled past — but in one border town, they appear be growing closer",Janis Mackey Frayer,"May 20, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"HEIHE, China — For about 1,000 miles, China and Russia are separated by the vast Amur River — a symbol of the countries’ tense and complicated history. A Russian flag could be seen fluttering across the frozen river from the Chinese border town of Heihe. From here, the two look a lot more like friends than rivals. The two countries’ close ties were on vivid display in this trading outpost when NBC News visited recently. Trucks loaded with goods regularly crossed the Amur, known in China as the Heilong, along a new bridge linking Heihe to Blagoveschchensk, its sister city in Russia. The Russian influence in Heihe, such as the Russian-style domes or spires that top Chinese-style apartment towers, schools, museums and even some government buildings, draws tourists from all over China. Sanctioned by the United States and allies for its war on Ukraine, Russia has found an economic lifeline in neighboring China, with which it declared a “no limits” partnership weeks before the Ukraine invasion in February 2022. Bilateral trade grew almost 30% last year, according to Chinese customs figures, and Russia was China’s top oil supplier in the first two months of the year. “It’s very obvious Russia is increasingly dependent on China, even though Russians may not like that,” said Jon Yuan Jiang, a China-Russia relations expert in Sydney. Heihe, a city of some 1.5 million people, is largely bilingual, with shop names, street signs and menus written in Chinese and Russian. Local business owners, even fruit vendors and roadside popcorn makers, greet foreigners in simple Russian, a skill they learned before the pandemic when Russian customers came in large numbers. “When the border trade was not affected by the pandemic, we could see Russians everywhere on the street, just like meeting with old friends,” a man who identified himself only by his surname, Shi, 70, told NBC News while walking his dog in a riverside park with large sculptures of Russian dolls. Between the Ukraine conflict and strict “zero-Covid” policies that China only recently ended, there have been fewer visitors from across the border, said Tang Lu, the owner of a Russian-style bar whose customers are mainly Russians. “But Chinese people also like this place, and they may sing and interact with Russians,” she said. While China and Russia have a long and often acrimonious relationship dating back centuries, the war in Ukraine has pushed them closer together, with China supporting Russia politically and economically and repeating Russian talking points. Chinese President Xi Jinping is trying to strike a delicate balance in his approach to the Ukraine conflict, Jiang said. China has sought to portray itself as neutral, refusing to condemn Russia’s aggression or even call it an invasion, while also calling for peace talks. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who describe each other as friends, have talked multiple times since the war began and met in Moscow last month. Meanwhile, there is no indication when Xi will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he spoke late last month for the first time since the invasion. “China doesn’t really want to support Russia in Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, but China does not want Vladimir Putin to fail as well,” fearing he could be replaced with a pro-Western government, Jiang said. Chinese efforts to appear aloof from the conflict took a hit after Beijing’s ambassador to France said the countries in eastern Europe that gained independence following the Soviet Union’s fall in 1991 did not have “effective” sovereign status in international law, prompting a furious response from European officials. China appeared to downplay Lu’s remarks, affirming the former Soviet nations’ sovereignty and emphasizing its preferred role as an honest broker in the war. A major reason China has avoided supporting Russia too openly, Jiang said, is it doesn’t want to jeopardize its vision of a multipolar international order that is less dominated by the United States. It especially wants to avoid alienating Europe, which also aspires to a larger global role. “If China is still trying to have a multipolar world, China needs the support of the E.U.,” he said. For that same reason, Jiang said he did not think China would provide Russia with lethal military assistance, which the Biden administration has warned Beijing against. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said this month that China would not sell weapons to either side in the war. China has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker in Ukraine, releasing a 12-point proposal in February that the West has dismissed as too favorable to Russia. The attempts at mediation are part of a broader effort by Xi to present himself as a global statesman and China as an alternative to American power. Last month, Beijing brokered a surprise deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore diplomatic ties for the first time in seven years. Experts say the shifts in the China-Russia relationship have mostly been to China’s benefit. Western sanctions have made Russia more dependent on China’s currency, the yuan, which Beijing is trying to internationalize. The yuan has replaced the U.S. dollar as the most traded currency on the Moscow Exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Bangladesh recently agreed to use yuan to pay for a nuclear plant Russia is building in the South Asian country, Reuters reported. Russia’s growing isolation has also created opportunities for Chinese companies. With tech giants like Apple and Samsung having reduced their operations in the country, more than 70% of Russia’s smartphones now come from Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi, Reuters reported, citing a statement from the consumer electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado. But the war in Ukraine still casts a big shadow in border towns like Heihe. “I was in shock and disbelief when the war broke out,” said Shi, the resident in the park. “After all, the war can only bring harm to the people of two countries. I wish the war can end as soon as possible.” CORRECTION (May 20, 2023, 5:45 p.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated the timing of when Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were last in contact. The pair spoke last month, which was after Russia invaded Ukraine; their last contact was not prior to the invasion. "
Air strikes hit Khartoum’s outskirts as Sudan war enters sixth week,Reuters,"May 20, 2023, 9:55 AM UTC",World,"Air strikes hit outer areas of the Sudanese capital Khartoum overnight and on Saturday morning, as fighting that has trapped civilians in a humanitarian crisis and displaced more than a million entered its sixth week. The fighting between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has led to a collapse in law and order with looting that both sides blame the other for. Stocks of food, cash, and essentials are rapidly dwindling. Air strikes were reported by eyewitnesses in southern Omdurman and northern Bahri, the two cities that lie across the Nile from Khartoum, forming Sudan’s “triple capital.” Some of the strikes took place near the state broadcaster in Omdurman, the eyewitnesses said. Eyewitnesses in Khartoum said that the situation was relatively calm, although sporadic gunshots could be heard. The conflict, which began on April 15, has displaced almost 1.1 million people internally and into neighboring countries. Some 705 people have been killed and at least 5,287 injured, according to the World Health Organization. Talks sponsored by the United States and Saudi Arabia in Jeddah have not been fruitful, and the two sides have accused each other of violating multiple ceasefire agreements. “We faced heavy artillery fire early this morning, the whole house was shaking,” Sanaa Hassan, a 33-year-old living in the al-Salha neighborhood of Omdurman, told Reuters by phone. “It was terrifying, everyone was lying under their beds. What’s happening is a nightmare,” she said. The RSF is embedded in residential districts, drawing almost continual air strikes by the regular armed forces. In recent days ground fighting has flared once again in the Darfur region, in the cities of Nyala and Zalenjei. Both sides blamed each other in statements late on Friday for sparking the fighting in Nyala, one of the country’s largest cities, which had for weeks been relatively calm due to a locally-brokered truce. A local activist told Reuters there were sporadic gun clashes near the city’s main market close to army headquarters on Saturday morning. Almost 30 people have died in the two previous days of fighting, according to activists. The war broke out in Khartoum after disputes over plans for the RSF to be integrated into the army and over the future chain of command under an internationally backed deal to shift Sudan towards democracy following decades of conflict-ridden autocracy. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) announced late on Friday more than $100 million to Sudan and countries receiving fleeing Sudanese, including much-needed food and medical aid. “It’s hard to convey the extent of the suffering occurring right now in Sudan,” said agency head Samantha Power.

Syria’s Assad receives warm welcome at Arab summit after years of isolation,Reuters,"May 19, 2023, 6:22 PM UTC",World,"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was given a warm welcome at an Arab summit on Friday, winning a hug from Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince at a meeting of leaders who had shunned him for years, in a policy shift opposed by the U.S. and other Western powers. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shook hands with a beaming Assad as the summit got underway in Jeddah, turning the page on enmity towards a leader who drew on support from Shi’ite Iran and Russia to beat back his foes in Syria’s civil war. The summit showcased redoubled Saudi Arabia efforts to exercise sway on the global stage, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in attendance and Crown Prince Mohammed restating Riyadh’s readiness to mediate in the war with Russia. Oil powerhouse Saudi Arabia, once heavily influenced by the United States, has taken the diplomatic lead in the Arab world in the past year, re-establishing ties with Iran, welcoming Syria back to the fold, and mediating in the Sudan conflict. With many Arab states hoping Assad will now take steps to distance Syria from Shi’ite Iran, Assad said the country’s “past, present, and future is Arabism”, but without mentioning Tehran — for decades a close Syrian ally. In an apparent swipe at Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has backed Syrian rebels and sent Turkish forces into swathes of northern Syria, Assad noted the “danger of expansionist Ottoman thought”, describing it as influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood — an Islamist group seen as a foe by Damascus and many other Arab states. Crown Prince Mohammed said he hoped Syria’s “return to the Arab League leads to the end of its crisis,” 12 years after Arab states suspended Syria as it descended into a civil war that has killed more than 350,000 people. Saudi Arabia would “not allow our region to turn into a field of conflicts”, he said, saying the page had been turned on “painful years of struggle”. Washington has objected to any steps towards normalization with Assad, saying there must first be progress towards a political solution to the conflict. Addressing the summit, Zelenskyy, who wants to build support for Kyiv’s battle against Russia, asked the delegates to support Ukraine’s formula for peace and thanked Riyadh for its role in mediating a prisoner release last year. In a letter to the summit, President Vladimir Putin said Russia attached “great importance to the development of friendly relations and constructive partnership” with regional states. Gulf states have tried to remain neutral in the Ukraine conflict despite Western pressure on Gulf oil producers to help isolate Russia, a fellow OPEC+ member. Arab leaders attending included Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who said in 2018 the region could not tolerate “a war criminal” like Assad. Qatar has reluctantly withdrawn its opposition to Riyadh’s move to readmit Syria. Finding a political solution to the 12-year-old conflict remains a big dilemma for Arab and Western countries. According to UNHCR since 2011, more than 14 million Syrians have fled their homes, and about 6.8 million remain displaced in their own country, where 90% of the population live below the poverty line. About 5.5 million Syrian refugees live in neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. "
Top U.S. and China commerce officials to hold rare trade talks next week,Rose Horowitch,"May 19, 2023, 2:48 PM UTC",Politics News,"Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao will travel to the U.S. next week for meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Trade Representative Katherine Tai, according to the Chinese embassy in Washington. Wang will address “respective concerns"" over economic and trade relations between the two nations in his talks with the U.S. officials, embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said Thursday. He will also attend a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers during his trip. In recent years, top U.S. and China commerce officials have rarely held meetings. Wang last spoke to Raimondo in 2021 in an introductory call, and he spoke with Tai on the sidelines of last year's APEC meeting. Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated under the Biden and Trump administrations, and relations in recent months have been further strained by the 200-foot-tall Chinese airship, which the U.S. called a spy balloon designed for eavesdropping. Still, the U.S. and China remain important trade partners. In 2022, bilateral trade hit a historic high of nearly $760 billion, according to the embassy briefing. ""This fully demonstrates the strong complementarity between the two countries and resilience of the economic and trade relationship,"" Liu said. ""This bilateral relationship cannot be simplistically defined by 'competition."" Representatives for Raimondo and Tai did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The expected trade talks next week come after NBC News reported last month that a breakdown in communication between Washington and Beijing is raising the risk of an unintended crisis or conflict between the two nations.

Australian police taser a 95-year-old woman with dementia,Lyme Cho,"May 19, 2023, 2:00 PM UTC",World,"A 95-year-old woman is in critical condition after police in Australia shocked her with a stun gun as she approached them with a walking frame and a steak knife at her nursing home. Clare Nowland, who has dementia, was taken down by a senior constable, Peter Cotter, the assistant commissioner of New South Wales Police told a news conference Friday. At the time, ""she was approaching police, but it is fair to say at a slow pace,” he said. “She had a walking frame, but she had a knife.” He added that an internal investigation had been launched into the incident Wednesday at the Yallambee Lodge nursing home in Cooma, a small town around 240 miles south of Sydney. After responding to a call about a patient having a knife in her possession, Cotter said Nowland was found in a “small confined” treatment room by two officers who arrived at the scene. “Negotiations commenced for her to drop the knife. For whatever reasons, Clare did not do that,” he said, adding that the senior constable activated his stun gun, which are widely known as Tasers after a major manufacturer. “I can’t take it any further as to what was going through anyone’s mind,” Cotter said. The 5-foot-2 woman, who weighs 95 pounds, fell to the ground and struck her head. Paramedics transferred Nowland to a nearby hospital where her head injury has rendered her bedridden. “She remains in and out of consciousness,” Cotter said. He added that she had left her bedroom and obtained the knife from the kitchen at Yallambee Lodge, a 93-room facility which “offers a range of accommodation and support options for those with higher care needs, dementia and respite care for both individuals and couples,” according to its website. NBC News has reached out to Yallambee Lodge for comment. Community advocate Andrew Thaler, who is assisting the family, said Friday that they were “shocked, confused, angry, and hurt” by the incident. “There was nothing she could do with the knife,” he said. “I bet all she could do was hurt herself. The police and the nurses are trained to treat people with dementia, if they can’t do that, why is she there?” Nowland, a long-standing member of the community, ran charity shops, was a regular churchgoer and cooked meals for the other elderly people through outreach work, Thaler said. “Clare is one of the ladies who gave more than she got,” he added. Thaler said her family of eight children and more than 60 grandchildren and great-grandchildren knew she was “old and at the end of her life line, but to suddenly have it cut short and ruined in such a way is shocking and confronting.” “It’s absurd,” he added. Cotter refused to answer any questions about criminal charges for the officer, but confirmed that he had served 12 years on the force. He added that the officer was “nonoperational at this stage while he is under review.” “Not one of our officers is above the law, and all our actions will be scrutinized robustly from a criminal and departmental perspective,” he said. The investigation was nominated a level 1 incident, which classifies injuries that lead to death or imminent death with exceptional circumstances. The classification ensures the highest level of inquiry with the inclusion of a homicide squad. “Critical incidents are a matter we are always transparent on,” Cotter said. Two police body cameras captured the incident, forming “a significant and integral part of the investigation,” but it will not be released because “it is not in the public interest,” he added. The investigation will be ultimately reviewed by the professional standards command of the South Wales Police Force, Cotter said, with oversight by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission of New South Wales.

A costly joke: China slaps comedy firm with $2 million fine for military gag,Reuters,"May 17, 2023, 9:48 AM UTC / Updated May 19, 2023, 1:58 PM UTC",World,"China on Wednesday slapped one of the country’s best-known comedy companies with a 14.7 million yuan ($2.13 million) penalty, accusing it of “harming society” after a military joke made by one of its comedians drew strong public criticism. The Beijing arm of China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism Bureau said it would fine Shanghai Xiaoguo Culture Media Co 13.35 million yuan and confiscate 1.35 million yuan in “illegal gains” from the firm after finding that a recent show by Li Haoshi, who performs under the name House, had breached rules. The incident has strongly divided the Chinese public over what sort of jokes are inappropriate as performances such as stand-up comedy become increasingly popular and also highlighted the limits of appropriate content in China where authorities say it must promote core socialist values. Li went viral on Chinese social media earlier this week after an audience member posted online a description of a joke he had made at a live stand-up set in Beijing on May 13, describing it as demeaning to China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). In the joke, Li recounted seeing two stray dogs he had adopted chase a squirrel and said it had reminded him of the phrase “have a good work style, be able to fight and win battles,” a slogan Chinese President Xi Jinping used in 2013 to praise the PLA’s work ethic. “We will never allow any company or individual use the Chinese capital as a stage to wantonly slander the glorious image of the PLA,” the cultural bureau said, adding that Xiaoguo Culture would be barred from staging any future shows in Beijing. In response to the fine, Xiaoguo Culture blamed the incident on “major loopholes in management” and said it had terminated Li’s contract. Reuters could not immediately reach Li for comment and Weibo appears to have banned him from posting to his account there. Founded in Shanghai in 2015, Xiaoguo Culture’s popularity has grown in sync with China’s embrace of stand-up comedy and had known for raising the profile of hundreds of local comedians. The firm and its artists have fallen foul of authorities before. In July 2021, the company was fined 200,000 yuan for publishing advertisements that featured a comedian endorsing a lingerie brand with comments said to objectify women. "
"Andy Rourke, The Smiths bass player, dies at 59",The Associated Press,"May 19, 2023, 1:44 PM UTC",Music,"LONDON — Andy Rourke, bass guitarist of The Smiths, one of the most influential British bands of the 1980s, has died after a lengthy illness with pancreatic cancer, his former bandmate Johnny Marr said Friday. He was 59. In a lengthy post on Instagram, guitarist and songwriter Marr paid tribute to Rourke, who he first met when both were schoolboys in 1975. “Throughout our teens we played in various bands around south Manchester before making our reputations with The Smiths from 1982 to 1987, and it was on those Smiths records that Andy reinvented what it is to be a bass guitar player,” Marr said. During their short time together as a four-piece band, The Smiths deliberately stayed away from the mainstream of popular music, garnering a cult following on the independent music scene. Though much of the attention focused on the songwriting partnership of Marr and frontman Steven Patrick Morrissey, better known as Morrissey, the sound of The Smiths owed much to Rourke’s bass and his rhythm section partner, drummer Mike Joyce. As their popularity swelled, the band released some of the most enduring British music of the 1980s, including “Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now” and “Girlfriend In A Coma.” "
Iran executes 3 men over violence during anti-government protests,Associated Press,"May 19, 2023, 10:55 AM UTC",World,"Iran on Friday executed three men accused of deadly violence during last year’s anti-government protests despite objections from human rights groups. Mizan, the judiciary’s website, announced the executions of Majid Kazemi, Saleh Mirhashemi and Saeed Yaghoubi, without saying how they were carried out. Authorities say they killed a police officer and two members of the paramilitary Basij group in Isfahan in November during nationwide protests. Rights groups say the three were subjected to torture, forced into televised confessions and denied due process. The protests erupted last September after the death of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, who had been detained by the country’s morality police for allegedly violating its strict Islamic dress code. The demonstrations rapidly escalated into calls for the overthrow of the theocracy that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The demonstrations have largely subsided in recent months, though there are still sporadic acts of defiance, including the refusal of a growing number of women to wear the mandatory Islamic headscarf, known as the hijab. Iran has executed a total of seven people in connection with the protests. Rights groups say they and several others who have been sentenced to death were convicted by secretive state security courts and denied the right to defend themselves. “The prosecution relied on forced ‘confessions,’ and the indictment was riddled with irregularities that reveal this was a politically motivated case,” Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, said of the three executed on Friday. The group said Kazemi had called a relative and accused authorities of torturing him by flogging his feet, using a stun gun and threatening him with sexual assault. London-based Amnesty International also criticized the cases. “The shocking manner in which the trial and sentencing of these protesters was fast-tracked through Iran’s judicial system amid the use of torture-tainted ‘confessions’, serious procedural flaws and a lack of evidence is another example of the Iranian authorities’ brazen disregard for the rights to life and fair trial,” said Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty’s deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. Iran launched a heavy crackdown on the protests, portraying them — without evidence — as a foreign-backed conspiracy. The protesters said they were fed up after decades of repression and poor governance. Iran’s economy has been in a tailspin since the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement and restored crippling sanctions. Robert Malley, the U.S. envoy for Iran, had spoken out against the imminent execution of the three men, calling it “an affront to the human rights and basic dignity of all Iranians” that showed the government “has learned nothing from the protests.” “The United States will continue to stand with the Iranian people. We are coordinating closely with our allies and partners to expose and confront the Iranian regime’s unremitting human rights abuses,” Malley tweeted on Thursday. More than 500 people were killed during months of protests, including dozens of members of the security forces. Some 19,000 people were arrested, though many have since been released. Iran is one of the world’s leading executioners. At least 582 people were executed in 2022, up from 333 the previous year. The surge in executions, including for drug violations and vague charges of “enmity against God” and “spreading corruption on earth,” has drawn criticism from U.N. officials and human rights activists.

"Salman Rushdie honored at PEN America gala, his first in-person appearance since stabbing",Associated Press,"May 19, 2023, 10:50 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Salman Rushdie made an emotional and unexpected return to public life Thursday night, attending the annual gala of PEN America and giving the event’s final speech as he accepted a special prize, the PEN Centenary Courage Award, just nine months being after being stabbed repeatedly and hospitalized. “It’s nice to be back — as opposed to not being back, which was also a possibility. I’m glad the dice rolled this way,” Rushdie, 75, told hundreds gathered at the American Museum of Natural History, where he received a standing ovation. It was his first in-person appearance at a public event since he was attacked last August while on stage at a literary festival in Western New York. Rushdie, whose attendance had not been announced beforehand, spoke briefly, and dedicated some of his remarks to those who came to his help at the Chautauqua Institution, a nonprofit education and retreat center. He cited a fellow attendee, Henry Reese of the City of Asylum project in Pittsburgh, for tackling the assailant and thanked audience members who also stepped in. “I accept this award, therefore, on behalf of all those who came to my rescue. I was the target that day, but they were the heroes. The courage, that day, was all theirs, and I thank them for saving my life,” he said. “And I have one last thing to add. It’s this: Terror must not terrorize us. Violence must not deter us. La lutte continue. La lutta continua. The struggle goes on.” Attacks against Rushdie have been feared since the late 1980s and the publication of his novel “The Satanic Verses,” which Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned as blasphemous for passages referring to the Prophet Mohammad. The Ayatollah issued a decree calling for Rushdie’s death, forcing the author into hiding, although he had been traveling freely for years before the stabbing. Since then he has since granted few interviews and otherwise communicated through his Twitter account and prepared remarks. Earlier this week, he delivered a video message to the British Book Awards, where he was given a Freedom to Publish prize. Rushdie was clearly elated to attend the gala, but his voice sounded frailer than it once did and the right frame of his glasses was dark, concealing the eye blinded by his attacker. PEN galas have long been a combination of literature, politics, activism and celebrity, with attendees ranging from Alec Baldwin to Sen. Angus King of Maine. Other honorees Thursday included “Saturday Night Live” producer Lorne Michaels and the imprisoned Iranian journalist and activist Narges Mohammadi, who was given the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. “Dear writers, thinkers, and sympathizers, I implore you to help the Iranian people free themselves from the grip of the Islamic Republic, or morally speaking, please help end the suffering of the Iranian people,” Mohammadi wrote from prison in a letter read aloud at the ceremony. “Let us prove the magic of global unity against authorities besotted with power and greed.” The host Thursday night was “Saturday Night Live” head writer Colin Jost, who inspired nervous laughter with jokes about the risks of being in the same room as Rushdie, likening it to sharing a balcony section with Abraham Lincoln. He also referred briefly to the Hollywood writers strike, which has left “Saturday Night Live” off the air since early May, saying it was “disorienting” to spend the afternoon on a picket line and then show up “for the museum cocktail hour.” PEN events are familiar settings for Rushdie, a former president of PEN, the literary rights organization for which freedom of speech is a core mission. He has attended many times in the past and is a co-founder of PEN’s World Voices Festival, an international gathering of author panels and interviews held around the time of the PEN gala. Rushdie’s surprise appearance was the highlight of an eventful month for PEN, the literary and free expression organization that has been in the middle — by choice and otherwise — of various conflicts. On Wednesday, PEN and Penguin Random House sued a Florida school district over its removal of books about race and LGBTQ+ identities. Earlier in the week, writer Masha Gessen disclosed she had resigned as vice president of the PEN board after a World Voices panel with Russian dissidents she was scheduled to moderate was called off amid objections to their presence from Ukrainians in town for a separate PEN event. Last week, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos announced he would not attend the gala, where he was to accept the PEN America Business Visionary Award. Sarandos cited the writers strike, during which Netflix has been a prime target of criticism among union members. But the company was cited Thursday night as a prime sponsor of the dinner ceremony. Former SNL writer and performer John Mulaney presented Michaels with the PEN Literary Service Award, which has previously been given to Stephen King, Stephen Sondheim and Rushdie, who won in 2014 for his “unparalleled artistry and courage as a novelist and essayist.” Michaels has helped launched countless television and film stars, but on Thursday he dedicated his speech to writers and the writing room of SNL. Writers, he explained, are associated with “paper airplanes” and “just fooling around” and the stereotypes “are not entirely wrong.” Writers are kind of like monkeys “because the monkeys are funny and you don’t really know what they’re going to do and they kind of remain us of us.” But they’re also some of the “most brilliant and sophisticated men and women I know,” he added, and the “beating heart” of “Saturday Night Live” is in the writers room. “It’s a room you want to be in,” he said. “It has the slight whiff of freedom that you take in when you laugh.” "
GOP lawmaker hits pause on enforcing subpoena for 2021 Afghanistan cable,Abigail Williams,"May 18, 2023, 9:44 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said Thursday that he'll ""pause"" enforcement of the committee’s subpoena for the State Department to produce a 2021 cable in which 23 U.S. diplomats warned of Kabul’s potential collapse soon after U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, McCaul, R-Texas, accepted the State Department's invitation to view the dissent cable and its response. McCaul had threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress for not turning over the classified document. ""In light of this invitation, I will pause efforts to enforce the Committee’s subpoena pending my review of the documents,"" McCaul wrote. ""Please note, however, that the subpoena remains in full force and effect, and the acceptance of this accommodation does not waive any of the Committee’s rights regarding the subpoena."" He also insisted on ""allowing other Members to review the dissent cable and response."" Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, will be allowed to view the documents with McCaul. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McCaul's letter. The State Department has made various counteroffers to McCaul's March subpoena, including providing a written summary of the cable’s contents in addition to a classified briefing. McCaul, however, has insisted that the committee receive a full copy of the cable, as well as Blinken’s response to it. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was widely viewed as chaotic. A deadly attack at Abbey Gate at Kabul International Airport resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghan civilians. The Biden administration has blown past three deadlines for a congressional subpoena for the dissent cable, arguing that providing the sensitive memo to Congress would deter diplomats from using the channel to voice opposing views. The State Department said Wednesday it would let the top two members of the Foreign Affairs Committee — McCaul and Meeks — view the 2021 cable, according to a letter obtained by NBC News. “The accommodations that the Department has provided to date are extraordinary and, as stated in our prior correspondence, already create a serious risk of chilling both future use of, and future candor in, Dissent Channel cables,” said the letter from the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Naz Durakoglu, which called the latest proposal “extraordinary.” The letter added that the State Department’s offer was contingent on the committee’s suspending all enforcement actions related to the subpoena, including dropping the threat to hold Blinken in contempt. McCaul on Wednesday called the offer “a significant step forward” but did not drop his contempt threat. Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesperson, defended the department's engagement Thursday. “I think it is natural in these discussions for there to be deliberations and accommodations about the path forward. I’m certainly not going to speculate and hypothesize on how we continue to further engage with the committee,” Patel told reporters. “What I will reiterate, though, is that at every turn we have offered tangible, fair and realistic accommodations that we think have sufficiently met and continue to sufficiently meet the committee’s request for information.” "
An ancient writing system from the Philippines makes an unlikely comeback,Jordan Winters,"May 18, 2023, 7:58 PM UTC",Asian America,"One glance at Filipino social media and you will find a recurrent set of waves, twists and inverted heart shapes. They’re more than just symbols — they’re part of the 17-character writing system called Baybayin, which is making a comeback after hundreds of years. The ancient script can now be found on streetwear and trendy booze, in card games and tattoos and even on Filipina American singer H.E.R.’s attire. When the Spanish colonized the Southeast Asian archipelago, they instructed Filipinos to use the Latin alphabet, and Baybayin, the written component of Tagalog, the national language of the Philippines, fell out of use. But over the past two decades, young people, artists and many among the Filipino diaspora are looking to re-establish a sense of cultural pride, and they have started a movement to bring it back to life. For Jay Enage, 50, one of the few Baybayin instructors in the country, the language is a crucial puzzle piece to Filipino identity. “The writing is visual. So that’s why it’s powerful. Because when you write something, what you say becomes record, it becomes document, and it becomes permanent,” he said. Enage, who has been teaching and advocating the language for 13 years, said he sees a real enthusiasm for it among the youth. High school student Nyrene Paranga is one of many youths seeking out ways to learn Baybayin and make it more accessible to her peers. She said it means a lot to her to help organize a Baybayin workshop at her school. “We hope that Baybayin will be part of the curriculum for high school and maybe elementary, because it can be incorporated with our mother tongue,” she said. “I mean, you get English subjects instead of Baybayin classes, and recently our school actually adapted Korean language instead of Baybayin.” But it is an uphill battle to find resources, Paranga said, as a national bill that would make Baybayin a requirement in schools’ curricula remains stalled in the Senate. Ethnic groups that speak their own languages oppose having aspects of Tagalog reinforced in the classroom, instead of their language. Enage is a major advocate of the bill. Outside of textbooks, the language has made some inroads. Android and Apple users can download a Baybayin keyboard on the app stores, and active Facebook groups walk members through translations. But it is the creative types who have found a visual playground in the script’s flowing curves, flexible loops and lightning bolt-like zigzags and propelled it into a hip part of pop culture. That, however, has opened up the question of whether Baybayin is destined to become a purely decorative script or a daily mode of communication. For artist and calligrapher Taipan Lucero, the two are not mutually exclusive — by increasing exposure, the artistic component complements efforts to promote fluency in the forgotten language. “One of my goals is to get interest through my art. When people see [Baybayin], they don’t know what it is. Aesthetically, they might be just attracted to how it looks. And then once they’re there, and then they sort of are curious about it,” Lucero said. A major presence among such cultural torchbearers are Filipinos abroad. “Just here in San Francisco, you see the script more within this 6th and Mission area, almost more than what you see in the Philippines. And that’s because the community has realized that there is a need for identity,” said Kristian Kabuay, a Filipino American artist. Kabuay said the script is more than a fad. He believes that Baybayin is so popular in the diaspora that a new chapter in its evolution has already begun and that, with it, so has a conversation about how the language can adapt to the 21st century. “After you identify as Filipino, Filipinx or whatever that is, you know, then what is that value, and that is the challenging part. So how do we give these cultural assets value? And with value comes protection,” he said. "
Devastating floods leave behind wrecked farms and ruined homes in northern Italy,Reuters,"May 18, 2023, 3:34 PM UTC",World,"Floods that killed nine people in Italy’s northern Emilia-Romagna region caused billions of dollars worth of damage and hit agriculture particularly hard, the regional governor said on Thursday. Torrential rains this week devastated the eastern side of the region, known as Romagna, with up to 300 landslides, 23 overflowing rivers, some 400 roads damaged or destroyed, and 42 flooded municipalities. “We are facing a new earthquake,” Emilia-Romagna President Stefano Bonaccini told reporters, recalling the seismic events that struck the region in 2012, destroying thousands of homes. Noting that since then “almost everything” had been rebuilt, Bonaccini said, “that experience showed us that it can be done, and we will rebuild everything (again), I am sure of that.” According to the Coldiretti agricultural association, more than 5,000 farms were left under water in the region, which includes a so-called “Fruit Valley”, as well as corn and grain fields. “We had already estimated almost 1 billion euros of damage (from those floods), so imagine how much the figure will rise” with the new disaster, Bonaccini said, adding it was too early to give precise figures. The floods are the latest in a series of extreme weather events that have slammed Italy over the past year, as once exceptional disasters become a regular part of life. The government has promised almost $22 million in emergency aid, on top of around $10 million allocated in response to previous floods two weeks ago, which killed at least two people. Luxury sportscar maker Ferrari, which is based in Emilia-Romagna, announced a large donation. At least 10,000 people were forced to leave their homes, and many of those who remained in flooded areas were left with no electricity. One of the dead was swept away from her home and washed up on a beach some 20 miles away. In the town of Cesena, rain stopped and waters largely receded, allowing locals to regain access to their mud-wrecked homes, including couple Maurizio Cola and Raffaella Zanni who escaped early on Wednesday.

Desert monoliths reveal oldest blueprints for human-made megastructures,Patrick Smith,"May 18, 2023, 3:17 PM UTC",World,"If your understanding of Stone Age humans is one of primitive cave people bashing rocks together, then perhaps it’s time to think again. Our ancient ancestors were able to build huge Neolithic structures  based on detailed plans engraved in stone, that show levels of skill not previously seen this early in human evolution, a new study has found. The oldest such engravings found show how early humans built huge traps, known as desert kites, to catch wild animals, researchers said in a report published Wednesday in the academic journal PLOS ONE. The plans accurately depict the nearby traps to scale, they said. The research centers on two monoliths around 7,000 and 9,000 years old, one from Jordan and one from Saudi Arabia. Both were discovered in 2015 by Rémy Crassard, an archaeologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research, and his team. That team has since studied more than 6,000 desert kites and the findings could change society’s understanding of early humans and their relationship with the land. “The extreme precision of these engravings is remarkable, representing gigantic neighboring Neolithic stone structures, the whole design of which is impossible to grasp without seeing it from the air or without being their architect,” the study said. “They reveal a widely underestimated mental mastery of space perception, hitherto never observed at this level of accuracy in such an early context.” Humankind has been altering the landscape for at least 40,000 years — but it’s rare to find any plans or maps that predate the early civilizations. The desert kites and their corresponding plans predate Britain's Stonehenge by as much as 4,000 years. The traps are a series of walls and stones that are placed measuring from hundreds of feet to 3 miles. The megastructures converge inward to pits about 13 feet deep where animals could be trapped. The kites are so vast that they were only spotted from the air in the 1920s and later picked up by satellite imagery. The research team believes they were built across the Middle East and Central Asia, often far from human settlements, suggesting a sophisticated hunting strategy perhaps based not just on finding meat, but also materials for tools and clothes, such as horns, hair and hide. The engraving plans could have helped not just in the building of vast animal traps, but also in the planning of hunts, the study said. The kites are so vast they can’t be seen or surveyed from the ground without GPS technology. But no one truly knows how prehistoric people who hadn’t mastered making pottery managed to do it. “It would therefore seem that kite-building hunters knew how to use a surveying technique, still unknown to us, involving notions of measurement and even calculation,” the researchers said. “This tends to call into question the idea that a complex literate society is a necessary condition for map-making,” they added. A 2012 study of items found in a cave in modern-day South Africa found that Stone Age people were making beads, tools and pigments — and even making their own poison — around 44,000 years ago, some 20,000 years earlier than previously thought.

"Rafael Nadal to miss French Open with hip injury, expects 2024 to be last year of tennis career",Associated Press,"May 18, 2023, 2:52 PM UTC",Sports,"Rafael Nadal announced Thursday that he is pulling out of the French Open because of a lingering hip injury that has sidelined him since January and that he expects 2024 to be the final season of his career. The owner of a record 14 championships at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament will miss it for the first time since making his debut there in 2005. Nadal, who turns 37 next month, delivered the news of his withdrawal — and future plans — during a news conference at his tennis academy in Manacor, Spain. He said he does not want to set a date for his return to the tennis tour, but expects it to take months. And then, the 22-time Grand Slam champion added: “You never know how things will turn out, but my intention is that next year will be my last year.” Play begins at Roland Garros in Paris on May 28. Nadal has a career record of 112-3 across 18 appearances at the French Open, a level of dominance unmatched by any man or woman at any Grand Slam event in the long annals of a sport that dates to the 1800s. When Nadal won the trophy last year at age 36 while dealing with chronic foot pain, he became the oldest champion in tournament history. Nadal’s birthday is June 3, when ordinarily he might have been playing his third-round match in Court Philippe Chatrier. Instead, he will be out of action, just as he has been for most of this season. The Spaniard hasn’t competed anywhere since he lost to Mackie McDonald in the second round of the Australian Open on Jan. 18, when his movement clearly was restricted by a bothersome left hip flexor. That was Nadal’s earliest Grand Slam exit since 2016. An MRI exam the next day revealed the extent of the injury, and his manager said at the time that Nadal was expected to need up to two months to fully recover. He initially aimed to return at the Monte Carlo Masters in March on his beloved red clay, but he wasn’t able to play there, then subsequently sat out tournament after tournament, decreasing the likelihood that he would be fully fit in time for the French Open.

"Prince Harry and Meghan were 'shaken up' by paparazzi chase, security chief says",Jonathan Dienst,"May 18, 2023, 1:37 PM UTC",U.K. Royals,"Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex were “shaken up” after they were pursued by paparazzi through New York City earlier this week, the head of the security firm responsible for their transportation told NBC News. Tom Buda said the ""chase was frightening” for the couple and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, and “putting them in danger.” He added that he “felt bad they were shaken up.” Meghan’s mom had been particularly affected, he said. Buda, the president of Buda Security Inc, spoke out after it emerged that the trio had taken refuge at a New York City police station following what law enforcement sources said was a “chaotic pursuit” by photographers when they left a charity event in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday night. A spokesman for the couple said Wednesday that the “near catastrophic car chase” came “at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi.” They added that it lasted more than two hours, and that it “resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers.” Law enforcement sources pushed back against any characterization of the incident as “near catastrophic” but conceded that the incident was “a bit chaotic.” "
Walmart hasn't made changes to LGBTQ-themed merchandise in wake of Target backlash,Reuters,"June 1, 2023, 5:14 PM UTC",Business News,"Walmart on Wednesday said it has not made any changes to its LGBTQ-related merchandise tied to Pride Month, or to security measures in place at its stores, a week after rival Target pulled some LGBTQ-themed products following customer backlash. “We haven’t changed anything in our assortment,” Latriece Watkins, Walmart’s chief merchandising officer, said. Last week, Target pulled some Pride-related merchandise, including items by transgender designer Erik Carnell, saying the products led to “volatile circumstances,” such as confrontations between customers and Target employees, and customers throwing Pride merchandise on the floor. Walmart also offers LGBTQ-themed merchandise tied to Pride Month, which is celebrated in June, including rainbow-adorned flags, clothing and accessories. Its “Pride & Joy” collection includes a $7.98 set of enamel pins with messages such as “Be you. Be Proud.” and “You are enough.” Walmart’s Watkins said the retailer hasn’t changed its security measures in response to the confrontations Target cited at its own stores, adding that Walmart hasn’t seen similar issues. “In this particular case, when we think about security ... we have not done anything in particular differently related to security in our stores,” Watkins said.

Spirit Airlines blames huge delays and cancellations on a technical issue,Rob Wile,"June 1, 2023, 2:44 PM UTC",Consumer,"About 90% of Spirit Airlines flights were delayed Thursday amid a technical issue affecting the carrier's website. In a tweet posted at 8:43 a.m., Spirit said the issue was affecting Spirit.com, the Spirit Airlines app and its airport kiosks, leading to delays. In an emailed statement at 10:44 a.m., a Spirit spokesman said the issue had been resolved. ""We have resolved a network issue between third party services that affected our website, mobile app and some internal applications,"" the airline said in a follow-up email. ""We apologize for any delays and inconvenience, and we’re now working our way back to normal operations."" According to the flight-tracking site Pulse by Anuvu, fewer than 24% of Spirit flights were departing on time at 10:30 a.m. Thursday. By about noon, the figure had increased to nearly 90% — with more than 3% of flights canceled. The glitch represents a worrisome start to the summer travel season as the U.S. airline industry seeks to avoid repeating the turmoil of last year, when carriers were hobbled by delays and cancellations. And it comes just as the Transportation Security Administration reported that 2023 screening volumes have surpassed 2019 levels — putting even more pressure on airlines to meet booming demand. In a pre-Memorial Day interview, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg warned, ""We're not out of the woods."" ""We have seen demand come roaring back for air travel — and the system has struggled to keep up,"" he said. "
"Foodborne illness outbreaks at restaurants are often linked to sick workers, CDC finds",Aria Bendix,"May 30, 2023, 6:12 PM UTC / Updated May 31, 2023, 9:37 PM UTC",Health news,"Sick employees are major contributors to the spread of foodborne illnesses at restaurants and other food establishments, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Tuesday. From 2017 to 2019, the report found, around 40% of foodborne illness outbreaks with known causes were at least partly associated with food contamination by a sick or infectious worker. In 2017, for instance, Chipotle attributed a norovirus outbreak at its restaurant in Sterling, Virginia, to an employee who came to work while ill. Norovirus, a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhea, was the most common pathogen involved in foodborne illness outbreaks at U.S. restaurants during the years studied, according to the report. It accounted for 47% of the 800 outbreaks that the CDC identified. Salmonella — a bacteria that causes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps — accounted for nearly 19%. The report recommended that restaurants develop and enforce policies that require sick workers to notify their manager if they have symptoms and to stay home if they're ill. While most restaurants have at least some guidelines for sick workers, the report found that the policies are often incomplete. “Our data indicate that many restaurants do not have comprehensive sick worker policies that could help them prevent outbreaks from sick workers,” the CDC told NBC News in a statement. Around 92% of the managers the CDC interviewed said their establishment had a policy requiring food workers to report symptoms if they feel sick, but just 66% said those policies were written. And just 23% said their restaurant's policy listed all five of the symptoms that guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration suggest warrant notifying a manager: vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, sore throat with fever or a lesion with pus. More than 85% of the managers surveyed said their establishment had a policy that prevented sick employees from working, but just 62% of managers said the policy was written and 18% said their policy listed all five symptoms outlined by the FDA. ""It’s not just about a sick employee. It’s about when you have managers and district managers and store managers, etc., that aren’t following health department guidelines,"" said Darin Detwiler, a Northeastern University food regulatory policy professor who wasn’t involved in the research. Detwiler said better paid sick leave policies — either mandated at the state level or instituted by individual companies — would make it easier to stop outbreaks. Some past research backs that up: A 2021 study, for instance, determined that Olive Garden’s decision to expand paid sick leave coverage during the pandemic reduced the rate of front-line food service employees working while sick. The CDC report, however, found that fewer than half of food establishments with outbreaks provided paid sick leave to at least one food worker. Fourteen states and Washington, D.C. have paid sick leave laws, according to the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. ""If companies value their employees' health and their customers' health, then they would not be responding reactively to these things,"" Detwiler said. ""They would be taking proactive steps to prevent these things from happening."" In addition to paid sick leave, the CDC said, restaurants would benefit from a staffing plan that includes on-call workers. ""Prior studies show there are many reasons workers come in sick — certainly, there are financial reasons, but there are also social reasons, such as not wanting to let their coworkers down,"" the agency's statement said. Foodborne diseases cause around 48 million illnesses and 3,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. According to Detwiler, most of those deaths could be prevented. "
Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs files lawsuit alleging race played a role in marketing of his liquor brands,Associated Press,"May 31, 2023, 9:33 PM UTC",NBCBLK,"Rapper, producer and entrepreneur Sean “Diddy” Combs sued Diageo Wednesday, saying the spirits company didn’t make promised investments in his vodka and tequila brands and treated them as inferior “urban” products. The lawsuit, filed with the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan, says Diageo North America starved Combs’ Ciroc vodka and DeLeon tequila brands of resources even as it showered attention on other celebrity brands. Diageo bought actor George Clooney’s Casamigos tequila brand for $1 billion in 2017, for example. Combs, who is Black, said Diageo leadership told him his race was one of the reasons it limited distribution to urban neighborhoods. He was also told that some Diageo leaders resented him for making too much money, according to the lawsuit. “Cloaking itself in the language of diversity and equality is good for Diageo’s business, but it is a lie,” the lawsuit said. “While Diageo may conspicuously include images of its Black partners in advertising materials and press releases, its words only provide the illusion of inclusion.” Combs’ relationship with Diageo dates to 2007, when the London-based company — which owns more than 200 brands including Guinness beer and Tanqueray gin — approached Combs about Ciroc. In a statement, Diageo denied allegations of racism. “This is a business dispute, and we are saddened that Mr. Combs has chosen to recast this matter as anything other than that,” the company said in a statement. “While we respect Mr. Combs as an artist and entrepreneur, his allegations lack merit, and we are confident the facts will show that he has been treated fairly.” In the lawsuit, Combs said he intends to seek billions of dollars in damages in other legal proceedings against Diageo.

Amazon.com's Ring will pay $5.8 million after employees spied on customer videos,Reuters,"May 31, 2023, 6:48 PM UTC",Consumer,"Amazon.com’s doorbell camera unit Ring has reached a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission regarding privacy, according to a filing Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As part of the agreement, Ring is to pay $5.8 million, according to a filing. Amazon.com did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC said Ring gave employees unrestricted access to customers’ sensitive video data said “as a result of this dangerously overbroad access and lax attitude toward privacy and security, employees and third-party contractors were able to view, download, and transfer customers’ sensitive video data for their own purposes.” As part of the FTC agreement with Ring, which is good for 20 years, Ring is required to disclose to customers how much access to their data the company and its contractors have. In February 2019, Ring changed its access practices so that most Ring employees or contractors could only access a customer’s private video with that person’s consent. "
Chipmaker Nvidia hits $1 trillion market capitalization,"Rohan Goswami, CNBC","May 30, 2023, 1:39 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Nvidia hit a $1 trillion market capitalization at the open of trading in U.S. markets Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction. Market capitalization is the value of a company based on its share price and the number of outstanding shares of a company. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected. Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading. Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest. Nvidia’s expected market cap would place it alongside a handful of other companies, including Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, that have a $1 trillion market cap. Nvidia shares were already up 166.5% year-to-date prior to Tuesday’s open. "
Disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is booked into prison in Texas to begin serving 11-year sentence,Rob Wile,"May 30, 2023, 10:44 AM UTC",Business News,"Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the blood-testing lab Theranos, arrived at a federal prison in Texas on Tuesday to start serving an 11-year, 3-month sentence for her role in the fraud that transpired at the now-defunct company. She was found guilty of four counts of wire fraud in January 2022. Her conviction was the culmination of a saga that began nearly 20 years prior, in 2003, when she dropped out of Stanford University at age 19 to start a company whose technology she hoped could diagnose a multitude of medical conditions with just a pinprick of blood. Over the next decade, Holmes built Theranos into a darling of Silicon Valley, at one point valued at more than $9 billion. Theranos attracted investments from high-profile moguls, including Rupert Murdoch, the Walton family (heirs to the Walmart fortune) and former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Theranos' board of directors would grow to include former secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger; two former U.S. senators; and former Defense Secretary James Mattis. But Theranos' claims about its capabilities began to crumble following reports, led by then-Wall Street Journal journalist John Carreyrou, that the company's technology did not appear to work as claimed and that it could deliver faulty results. By March 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission had charged Holmes, as well as Theranos Chief Operating Officer Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani — who was also romantically linked to Holmes — with securities fraud. At that point, Theranos stripped Holmes of her control of the company and her stake in it. In June 2018, Holmes and Balwani were indicted on federal fraud charges. By the fall of that year, Theranos had announced it would dissolve. Holmes' and Balwani's trials would be postponed by the pandemic until fall 2021. Holmes' defense largely consisted of claims that she was under the control of Balwani, an argument Balwani subsequently denied. Holmes also argued that she had not sought to mislead investors. The jury rejected most of Holmes' arguments and delivered a guilty verdict. In fall 2022, Holmes and Balwani, who had also been found guilty, were sentenced. Experts say Balwani got a harsher sentence — nearly 13 years in prison — because of his experience running other businesses. Along the way, various motions for appeals and delays were largely denied. Holmes, now 39, recently gave birth to her second child. She will report to a minimum-security facility in Texas. Balwani, 57, began serving his sentence in April in California. In a recent New York Times profile, Holmes indicated she still harbored ambitions to work in the medical technology industry. “I still dream about being able to contribute in that space,” Holmes said. “I still feel the same calling to it as I always did and I still think the need is there.” "
How a U.S. debt default would affect American households,Rob Wile,"May 4, 2023, 12:03 PM UTC / Updated May 27, 2023, 3:44 PM UTC",Consumer,"The U.S. government is expected to hit its statutory borrowing limit as soon as June 5, little more than a week away. As of Friday morning, there was still no sign of an imminent resolution, and lawmakers and President Joe Biden were expected to depart Washington D.C. for the Memorial Day holiday. By the afternoon, the Treasury Department moved its ""X-date,"" the day on which the U.S. would default on its debt, from June 1 to June 5 to give negotiators some breathing room to reach a deal. Still, people all over the nation are now wondering what will happen to their personal finances if lawmakers don't reach a deal before the U.S. runs out of money to pay its bills. Based on the Social Security Administration's payment schedule, a June 5 debt default might actually protect beneficiaries from the potential of delayed checks and direct deposits. Individuals receiving disability payments are slated to receive their monthly payments June 1, while beneficiaries aged 88 and older are expected to receive their payments June 2. If the Treasury Department is unable to successfully prioritize payments to Social Security recipients, the consequences for these groups could be devastating, according to Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group. ""Those folks will be particularly hard-pressed to pay for basic necessities like rent, utilities, and out-of-pocket medical costs,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department referred an inquiry about prioritization to comments Secretary Janet Yellen has previously made on the matter, including a May 7 interview with in which she spoke of what would happen when the U.S. could no longer pay its bills. ""This would be really the first time in the history of America that we would fail to make payments that are due and whether it is defaulting on interest payments that are due on the debt or payments due for Social Security recipients or to Medicare providers, we would simply not have enough cash to meet all of our obligations,"" Yellen said. Beyond that initial group of payees, the Social Security Administration's monthly payments calendar suggests there is a bit more breathing room for other beneficiaries, providing that lawmakers reach a deal beforehand; the next beneficiary payments aren't expected until June 14. The debt default picture is also cloudy for individuals who rely on Medicare and Medicaid to pay medical bills, Adcock said. A spokesperson for the American Medical Association said it had no comment about what it suggests doctors should do in the event of a debt default. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers those government health programs, told NBC News earlier this month, “Defaulting on the national debt would severely damage the crucial health care programs millions of Americans rely on."" ""While the precise impact on CMS’s programs depends on many uncertain factors, it is clear that if the federal government is prevented from making good on its promises, there would be significant consequences for Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces.” According to Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the nonprofit research group Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, the full mechanics of how government services would manage a default are almost impossible to know, because there is no playbook for handling such a situation. “We don’t know how [the] Biden admin would treat a default,” he said. “Which bills would they pay?” Yellen has already warned that there is no easy way to reprogram the government’s payment systems to favor one set of recipients over another. “Treasury systems have all been built to pay all of our bills when they’re due and on time, and not to prioritize one form of spending over another,” she said earlier this year. Wells Fargo economists said in a recent note to clients that even if a payment prioritization plan were implemented, such a plan “would be entirely experimental and would still come with a litany of legal, technical, economic and political challenges.” “The economic impact of a default is highly uncertain since that has never happened previously, but economic modeling suggests the fallout could be quite severe,” they wrote. Since Yellen announced that a debt default could happen within the first few days of June, short-term U.S. borrowing costs have soared as investors demand greater return for the risk that they won't be paid on time. This was predictable: In fact, the U.S. did default once, by accident. In 1979, a series of events including the failure of word-processing equipment caused a temporary delay in payments to investors redeeming U.S. Treasury bills, Reuters has reported. Afterward, the cost of borrowing money for the U.S. increased by 0.6%, the wire service said, adding that an academic paper published a decade later argued that the ratcheting up of borrowing costs for the U.S was permanent. If the U.S. were to default again, the result would be the same, said Gleckman. “The primary effect would be interest rates going up significantly,”  Gleckman said. “And they’re already going up quickly and steeply. What this would do is accelerate movement toward higher interest rates.” As many consumers have learned since the Federal Reserve began its campaign last year to make borrowing more expensive in a bid to slow inflation, higher interest rates affect everything from credit cards to auto loans, student loans and mortgages. Meanwhile, businesses are likely to already be experiencing greater difficulty getting loans and hiring more workers, Gleckman noted. Many commercial interest rates have already gone up in recent months in the wake of the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank. The debt default deliberations also caused ratings agency Fitch to place the U.S.’s triple-A credit rating on watch for a potential downgrade. “The brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, failure of the U.S. authorities to meaningfully tackle medium-term fiscal challenges that will lead to rising budget deficits and a growing debt burden signal downside risks to U.S. creditworthiness,” Fitch analysts wrote this week.

Ford EVs will use Tesla charging tech in surprise partnership between rival automakers,"Michael Wayland, CNBC","May 26, 2023, 2:50 PM UTC",Tech News,"DETROIT — Ford Motor will partner with Tesla on charging initiatives for its current and future electric vehicles in an unusual tie-up between the two rivals, CEOs of the automakers announced Thursday. Under the agreement current Ford owners will be granted access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada, starting early next year, via the use of an adapter. And, Ford’s next-generation of EVs — expected by mid-decade — will include Tesla’s charging plug, allowing owners of Ford vehicles to charge at Tesla Superchargers without an adapter, making Ford among the first automakers to explicitly tie into the network. The initiatives were announced by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Tesla CEO Elon Musk during a live, audio discussion on Twitter Spaces. They come as Ford attempts to ramp up production of its fully electric vehicles in an attempt to catch up to — or someday surpass — Tesla’s sales in the segment. While Tesla still dominates the EV sector by far, Ford came in second in fully electric vehicle sales in the U.S. last year, notching sales of 61,575 electric vehicles. Farley said the company is “totally committed” to a single U.S. charging protocol that includes the Tesla plug port, known as NACS. It’s unclear if Ford’s next-gen EVs will maintain the charging ports featured on current models, known as CCS. A Ford spokesman said the company has “this option available to us but have no news to share today.” A separate Ford spokesman told CNBC that pricing for charging “will be competitive in the marketplace.” The companies will disclose further details closer to a launch date anticipated in 2024. Tesla previously discussed opening its private network to other EVs. White House officials announced in February that Tesla committed to open up 7,500 of its charging stations by the end of 2024 to non-Tesla EV drivers. Previously the company’s chargers in the U.S. were mostly used by and made to be compatible with Tesla’s EVs. In Tesla’s first-quarter shareholder deck, the company disclosed that it has roughly 45,000 Supercharger connectors worldwide at 4,947 Supercharger Stations. The company does not disclose chargers by country or revenue from the devices. It includes revenue from its Supercharging stations under a “services and other” segment. The Twitter Spaces event between Farley and Musk Thursday marks the latest interaction between the two executives, who have a unique rivalry. They have each expressed admiration for the other, despite their companies competing directly. Ford notably beat Tesla to the pickup segment beginning production of its F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its consistently popular trucks, in April 2022. Ford also heavily benchmarked the Tesla Model Y for its Mustang Mach-E crossover and followed Tesla in price cuts of the electric crossovers. But Musk, who leads Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter, has repeatedly praised Ford as a historic American company, lauding its ability to avoid bankruptcy, unlike its crosstown rivals General Motors and Chrysler during the Great Recession. Such flattery was prevalent during the Thursday call: “Working with Elon and his team, I’m really excited for our industry and for the Ford customers,” Farley said. Musk later reciprocated the feelings: “It’s an honor to be working with a great company like Ford,” he said. Farley prodded Musk a bit, asking about the long-delayed new version of the company’s first vehicle, the Roadster. Musk teased a Roadster refresh back in the fall of 2017. He promised it would have a 620-mile range per charge and three motors, among other features. Today, he reiterated Thursday, the new version of the Roadster is still not even completely designed. Earlier Thursday, Farley commended Tesla on its charging network during a Morgan Stanley conference, saying that while Ford has created its own charging products for its commercial customers, automakers should consider collaborating on charging infrastructure for the general public. “It seems totally ridiculous that we have an infrastructure problem, and we can’t even agree on what plug to use,” Farley said, noting that Tesla’s charging plug is different from that used by other automakers. “I think the first step is to work together in a way we haven’t, probably with the new EV brands and the traditional auto companies.” "
Elon Musk’s brain implant company Neuralink announces FDA approval of in-human clinical study,"Ashley Capoot, CNBC","May 26, 2023, 11:46 AM UTC",Business News,"Neuralink, the neurotech startup co-founded by Elon Musk, announced Thursday it has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to conduct its first in-human clinical study. Neuralink is building a brain implant called the Link, which aims to help patients with severe paralysis control external technologies using only neural signals. This means patients with severe degenerative diseases like ALS could eventually regain their ability to communicate with loved ones by moving cursors and typing with their minds. “This is the result of incredible work by the Neuralink team in close collaboration with the FDA and represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help many people,” the company wrote in a tweet. The FDA and Neuralink did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment. The extent of the approved trial is not known. Neuralink said in a tweet that patient recruitment for its clinical trial is not open yet. Neuralink is part of the emerging brain-computer interface, or BCI, industry. A BCI is a system that deciphers brain signals and translates them into commands for external technologies. Neuralink is perhaps the best-known name in the space thanks to the high profile of Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter. Scientists have been studying BCI technology for decades, and several companies have developed promising systems that they hope to bring to market. But receiving FDA approval for a commercial medical device is no small task — it requires companies to successfully conduct several extremely thorough rounds of testing and data safety collection. No BCI company has managed to clinch the FDA’s final seal of approval. But by receiving the go-ahead for a study with human patients, Neuralink is one step closer to market. Neuralink’s BCI will require patients to undergo invasive brain surgery. Its system centers around the Link, a small circular implant that processes and translates neural signals. The Link is connected to a series of thin, flexible threads inserted directly into the brain tissue where they detect neural signals. Patients with Neuralink devices will learn to control it using the Neuralink app. Patients will then be able to control external mice and keyboards through a Bluetooth connection, according to the company’s website. The FDA’s approval for an in-human study is a significant win for Neuralink after a series of recent hurdles at the company. In February, the U.S. Department of Transportation confirmed to CNBC that it had opened an investigation into Neuralink for allegedly packaging and transporting contaminated hardware in an unsafe manner. Reuters reported in March that the FDA had rejected Neuralink’s application for human trials, and reportedly outlined “dozens” of issues the company needed to address. Neuralink has also come under fire from activist groups for its alleged treatment of animals. The Physician’s Committee for Responsible Medicine, which advocates against animal testing, has repeatedly called on Musk to release details about experiments on monkeys that had resulted in internal bleeding, paralysis, chronic infections, seizures, declining psychological health and death. A representative for PCRM did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment. In addition to helping patients with paralysis, experts believe BCIs could someday help treat maladies like blindness and mental illness. Musk has expressed his intent for Neuralink to explore these future use cases, as well as potential applications for healthy people. At a “show and tell” recruitment event late last year, Musk even claimed he plans to someday receive one of Neuralink’s implants himself. “You could have a Neuralink device implanted right now and you wouldn’t even know,” Musk said at the time. “In fact, in one of these demos, I will.” "
2 planes aborted landings when a Southwest jet taxied across their runways in San Francisco,The Associated Press,"May 26, 2023, 12:06 AM UTC",U.S. news,"SAN FRANCISCO — Two airliners aborted landings at San Francisco International Airport last week after pilots spotted a Southwest Airlines jet taxiing across runways on which the other planes had been cleared to land. An air traffic controller told the Southwest pilots they should not have been on the runways during the May 19 incident. The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the Southwest plane cleared the runways when the other planes passed directly overhead, and the decision to abort the landings was “precautionary.” “The FAA looked into the events and determined the appropriate steps were taken to ensure safe operations,” the agency said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it is not investigating the matter. The incident comes after a half-dozen close calls in recent months that are being investigated by safety officials. Those include one in February in which a FedEx plane flew about 100 feet over the top of a Southwest jet in Austin, Texas, after an air traffic controller cleared both planes to use the same runway. In the incident this month, an inbound United Airlines plane flew as low as a few hundred feet over San Francisco Bay before pilots saw the Southwest jet on the same runway and decided to abandon their landing. Shortly after that, the crew of an incoming Alaska Airlines plane saw the same Southwest jet crossing a second, parallel runway, and the pilots aborted their landing too. Both the United and Alaska planes circled around and landed safely. The air traffic controller told the crew of the Southwest jet, “You shouldn’t be on the runway,” according to a recording captured by LiveATC.com. When one of the pilots tried to explain, the controller cut him off, saying, “I don’t need an argument.” The incident was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The San Francisco airport was the scene of a frightening near-disaster in 2017, when pilots of an Air Canada jet mistook a taxiway for their runway and nearly landed on top of four other planes waiting to take off. Despite recent close calls, the acting head of the FAA has said the nation’s air-traffic system is safe, pointing to the lack of a fatal crash involving a U.S. airline since 2009. However, concern about the close calls led the FAA to hold a “safety summit” in March. The agency said this week it is investing $100 million in improvements at 12 airports — but not San Francisco — to reduce the number of “runway incursions,” when a plane or airport vehicle is on a runway when it should not be.

The sum includes a nearly $5 million civil penalty and another $5 million to fund local environmental projects. “With this agreement, the Department of Environmental Protection is taking steps to hold Shell accountable and protect Pennsylvanians’ constitutional right to clean air and water while encouraging innovation and economic development in the Commonwealth,” said acting Secretary Rich Negrín. The “ethane cracker,” as the plant is called, is a 384-acre-wide industrial complex that heats ethane — a byproduct of fracking in the region — and “cracks” it under high pressure into ethylene to produce polyethylene pellets, a building block for plastic.

'Bud Light on us': Budweiser parent now offering money back to boost sales,Rob Wile,"May 25, 2023, 9:42 PM UTC",Consumer,"Just in time for Memorial Day: cheap beer and, in some cases, practically free. Bud Light parent company, AB InBev, has launched a promotion offering a rebate of up to $15 to win back customers of the longtime top-selling beer in the U.S. The web address of the promotion is BudLight.com/BudLightOnUs. U.S. residents can submit to that link proof of purchase of a 15-pack – or larger – of Budweiser, Bud Light, Bud Select or Bud Select 55 to receive a prepaid card worth up to $15. Customers will have until May 31 to make the purchase, and up to six months to use the card. The promotion follows the ongoing backlash to Bud Light's decision to tap transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney as a spokesperson during March Madness. Many customers also responded negatively to comments made by Alissa Heinerscheid, who took over as vice president of marketing for Bud Light last June, on a recent podcast. Among other things, she called on the brand to be more ""inclusive."" AB InBev did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to data cited by Beer Business Daily, Bud Light sales continued to fall through the week ending May 13, as negative sentiment toward the drink continued to build. AB InBev shares are now down 5% year-to-date and nearly 14% since the Mulvaney clip went online. "
Shaquille O’Neal served with FTX-related lawsuit at Miami Heat playoff game after dodging servers for months,David K. Li,"May 25, 2023, 5:27 PM UTC",Sports,"After somehow successfully avoiding it for months, Shaquille O’Neal was finally served papers on Tuesday in a legal battle over his involvement with a failed cryptocurrency exchange. The hard-to-miss, 7-foot-1 superstar had been dodging plaintiffs targeting him and other celebrities like Tom Brady and Larry David who had endorsed FTX, the now bankrupt crypto business. A plucky process server finally got Shaq, an analyst for TNT, at Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday night in Miami where the hometown Heat battled the Boston Celtics. The Heat play their homes games in Kaseya Center, a building that —until the collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried venture last year — had been named FTX Center. “He was personally provided the papers, so he cannot raise his absurd delay tactics,” the plaintiff's attorney, Adam Moskowitz, told the NBC sports platform Pro Football Talk. “We watched the prior Heat/Celtics game, so knew he would be in the outside broadcasting booth where fans were right next door.” O'Neal is the target of another lawsuit over his involvement with the NFT/crypto offering, the Astrals Project, according to the lawyer. “The allegations in the new crypto complaint are very serious and detail how him, his son and his business partner all founded this NFT Metaverse and he made promises every week that he would be extremely involved, so the value of the NFTs would grow greatly,” Moskowitz said. “Once the FTX fraud was revealed, he ran away and has not been heard since.” A representative for O'Neal could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday. The Hall of Fame hoopster has previously said that he, as ""just a paid spokesperson,"" shouldn't be held accountable for failed ventures. "
Target quietly moves Pride merchandise in some stores as conservative activists declare victory,Daniel Arkin,"May 24, 2023, 7:26 PM UTC / Updated May 24, 2023, 9:31 PM UTC",OUT News,"Target came under intense scrutiny this week after the retail giant announced that it was pulling some LGBTQ-themed merchandise following what a corporate spokesperson described as “threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and wellbeing while at work.” Target customers posted videos on TikTok showing that Pride merchandise displays had been moved to less visible locations, including the back of the store. “So disappointed in @target right now,” one TikTok user wrote in a caption to a video apparently recorded at a Target location in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. “You literally hid your LGBTQ ‘support’ so as to not offend hateful small minded people. Dont seem too concerned about offending your own employees and loyal customers though.” Target’s corporate communications department did not immediately respond to an email containing a list of questions, including which Pride items were removed and the nature of the threats against employees. In a statement Tuesday night, a spokesperson for Target said the company has “offered an assortment of products aimed at celebrating Pride Month” for more than a decade. But “since introducing this year’s collection, we’ve experienced threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and wellbeing while at work. “Given these volatile circumstances,” the spokesperson said, “we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior. Our focus now is on moving forward with our continuing commitment to the LGBTQIA+ community and standing with them as we celebrate Pride Month and throughout the year.” The company did not immediately reply to a question about how the corporate decision might be perceived by members of the LGBTQ community. In some stores in the South, Pride displays appeared to have been moved to less visible areas. At a Target in Cary, North Carolina, two employees who did not want to provide their names said the Pride collection was featured at the front of the store as recently as last week. The display is now further back, in the women's clothing section, and women's swimwear has been placed near the front. One employee said management told them to ""switch things around"" but they were not given a reason why. One TikTok user claimed that Target in Cypress, Texas, moved its Pride collection to the back of the store after a customer complained to upper management. In a phone interview, the manager of the Cypress, Texas, store referred NBC News to the corporate offices, but said moving the Pride collection to the back was a “total company decision” that had “nothing to do with the store.” The pullback did not seem to affect every store. Brian Sing, a senior merchandise planner at a Target location in Brooklyn, New York said the store’s large Pride display went up about two weeks ago and employees have not received any directions to take it down. Target’s large selection of Pride merchandise also comes amid an unprecedented time for LGBTQ rights in America. A historic 480 anti-LGBTQ bills have been filed in state legislatures across the country this year, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, with lawmakers enacting laws to curtail education on LGBTQ issues in schools, drag performances and transition-related healthcare, among other provisions. In a tweet Wednesday morning, the right-wing personality Matt Walsh wrote that his “goal” was to “make ‘pride’ toxic” for brands. “If they decide to shove this garbage in our face, they should know that they’ll pay a price,” he wrote. “It won’t be worth whatever they think they’ll gain.” Walsh alluded to the firestorm around Bud Light after the beer brand partnered with transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney this spring. Bud Light sales have dropped following an online campaign and calls for boycotts. “First Bud Light and now Target,” Walsh tweeted. “Our campaign is making progress. Let’s keep it going.” Other conservative activists all but declared victory, too. In a tweet, the self-described ""anti-woke"" activist Rogan O'Handley celebrated Bud Light's drop in company value and Target stock dropping on Wednesday. ""THIS IS WHAT WINNING LOOKS LIKE,"" he tweeted. Target hired LGBTQ designers for its Pride collection last year, saying it wanted to “authentically celebrate the community,” according to a company news release. The brand continued its partnership with queer designers for its collection this year. Conservative activists have taken particular issue with the collection’s apparel for kids, and a “tuck-friendly” bathing suit for adults. Clothing items for children include supportive slogans, including “just be you” and “trans people will always exist!” British designer Erik Carnell, one of the Pride collection’s LGBTQ collaborators had his products pulled from the company’s website within the last handful of days. He called the retailer’s decision to remove his products — which included apparel containing supportive messages, such as “cure transphobia, not trans people” and “we belong everywhere” — both “wrong” and “justified.” “It’s difficult because on one hand I’m obviously completely against it. I think that they should stand by their principles. If you’re going to have a Pride range centered around and created by LGBTQ people, then … you need to stick that out,” he said. “However, if I were working as a retail employee at a Target store, in an open carry state, I wouldn’t feel safe. So, I do understand their thought process on pulling some of the items. Justified or not, the safety of their employees has to be paramount.” Carnell’s partnership with Target has been scrutinized by opponents of the company’s Pride collection largely for his use of Satanic symbolism in some of his designs. None of Carnell’s products that were sold at Target contain Satanic imagery. However, that hasn’t stopped the “hundreds upon hundreds” of threatening emails he says he’s received in recent days. “I was overwhelmed by what a big opportunity this could be — the amount of people who would see my work who never otherwise would have been exposed to it, the people who are closeted that needed to see something positive when they’re walking in a retail store,” said Carnell. “And in the space of a handful of days, all of that has been completely taken away from me and I’m just left to deal with the death threats and to deal with the hate mail and to deal with the accusations of grooming with absolutely no support from Target.” In a statement on Wednesday, the LGBTQ rights organization GLAAD said “anti-LGBTQ violence and hate” would persist “until corporate leaders step up as heroes for their LGBTQ employees and consumers and do not cave to fringe activists calling for censorship.” “The fact that a small group of extremists are threatening disgusting and harsh violence in response to Target continuing its long-standing tradition of offering products for everyone should be a wake-up call for consumers and is a reminder that LGBTQ people, venues, and events are being attacked with threats and violence like never before,” GLAAD president and CEO executive Sarah Kate Ellis said. David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, said Target’s actions reflects a “superficial” commitment to its allyship with the LGBTQ community by “signaling that they care more about harrowing to hate mongers than they do standing with communities who need support,” he said.

‘Stop Asian Hate’ drove a funding surge for AAPI startups and nonprofits. What comes next?,Brian Cheung,"May 24, 2023, 6:48 PM UTC",Asian America,"The surge in activism to combat pandemic-era discrimination and violence against Asian American and Pacific Islanders didn’t just raise awareness, it raised money. Over the past several years, the “Stop Asian Hate” movement has driven a funding windfall to AAPI-led nonprofits and businesses that their leaders say has been indispensable. With the health crisis receding and the economy slowing, the organizations say they’re now focused on sustaining their momentum and warn against backsliding on recent gains. The flood of donations and investment has buoyed AAPI-led ventures ranging from food delivery startups to political engagement advocacy groups. The Asian American Foundation, launched in 2021, said it landed more than $1 billion in commitments. Its supporters include corporate partners like Amazon and Nike, as well as foundations like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The foundation in turn has directly funded organizations aligned with its initiatives to counter Asian hate, improve access to AAPI studies, support the arts and increase representation in business. Among the more than 100 grantees that have received foundation funds: Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the Asian American Education Project and the Center for Asian American Media. Broadly speaking, the nonprofit space has grown by magnitudes since 2020. Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics, a Los Angeles-based group aimed at improving representation in classrooms and boardrooms across the country, saw its revenue double. While grateful for the growth, Leadership Education President and CEO Linda Akutagawa said she worries about the “cyclical nature” of nonprofit funding. “It comes in and it goes out, or it stops,” she said. Before high-profile discrimination and a surge in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans in recent years drew fresh attention to AAPI causes nationwide, many had been historically overlooked for charitable contributions. A 2018 study from Asian American/Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy found that for every $100 donated by foundations for philanthropic reasons, just 20 cents was given to AAPI communities. “I hope that what I’m seeing is just a small blip” jump-starting a sustained uptick in support, Akutagawa said, “so that there’s at least a little bit more equity in the support that we’re getting from philanthropic entities.” Entrepreneurs have also seen a flood of money coming recently, a welcome development after widespread difficulties early in the pandemic, when Asian American businesses were particularly hard hit. Many of those businesses, which may have experienced more barriers in applying for Paycheck Protection Program loans, continue to operate on thin margins. In a 2022 survey of more than 700 AAPI business owners, the National Asian/Pacific Islander American Chamber of Commerce and Entrepreneurship found that two in three businesses needed additional credit or financing over the preceding year to keep afloat. While growing her Brooklyn-based food delivery service Umamicart, Andrea Xu landed funding from Gold House Ventures, a nonprofit collective that helped promote the Oscar-winning film “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” Last year, Gold House launched a $30 million venture fund thanks to investments from individual donors, including DoorDash CEO Tony Xu and TV host and author Padma Lakshmi, as well as venture firms such as Lightspeed and Bain Capital.

CDC investigating salmonella outbreak in 6 states linked to Papa Murphy’s cookie dough,The Associated Press,"May 24, 2023, 4:33 PM UTC",U.S. news,"SEATTLE — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with state and federal agencies, are investigating reports of 18 salmonella infections in at least half a dozen states that may have come from raw cookie dough sold at Papa Murphy’s. People have been sickened in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, California and Missouri, the CDC said Tuesday. Illnesses were reported from Feb. 27 to May 2. Interviews with sick people show that raw cookie dough sold at Papa Murphy’s Take ‘N’ Bake pizza stores may be contaminated. People reported eating the cookie dough raw, the CDC said. Six people in Washington, four in Idaho and four in Oregon have become sick, according to the CDC’s website. Utah says two people have become ill there. California and Missouri have each reported one sick person linked to the outbreak. Two people have been hospitalized, although their location was unclear. No deaths have been reported. The number of sick people is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak could extend to other states, CDC officials said. The take-and-bake pizza company — based in Vancouver, Washington — has temporarily stopped selling their raw chocolate chip cookie dough and s’more bars dough. Although a picture of desserts, including cookies and s’more bars, could be seen on their website Tuesday, those items were not available to order. People who have the dough in their homes should throw it away, and items and surfaces that may have touched the dough should be washed in the dishwasher or with hot, soapy water, according to the CDC. Investigators are working to identify the contaminated ingredient in the raw cookie dough. Most people infected with salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps six hours to six days after being exposed to the bacteria. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment, according to the CDC. Children under 5, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe illness. "
Target pulls some Pride collection items after threats to employees,Phil Helsel,"May 24, 2023, 1:39 AM UTC",Business News,"Mega retailer Target is pulling some of its merchandise that celebrates Pride month after threats to employees, the company said Tuesday. “Since introducing this year’s collection, we’ve experienced threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and wellbeing while at work,” a Target spokesperson said in a statement. “Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior,” the spokesperson said. The retailer's decision comes amid a wider national debate over civil rights for transgender people. Target did not say which items were being removed or immediately provide more details about the threats. The collection includes “tuck-friendly” swimsuits that allow trans people who have not had gender-affirming operations to conceal their private parts, The Associated Press has previously reported. Those swimsuits, which are available only in adult sizes, were used in false and misleading claims by critics online. The Target spokesperson did not answer whether those bathing suits were among the products in question. The retailer said that it has offered products to go along with Pride month for more than a decade. Pride Month is June, and celebrates lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people and issues. “Our focus now is on moving forward with our continuing commitment to the LGBTQIA+ community and standing with them as we celebrate Pride Month and throughout the year,” the store spokesperson said Tuesday. Some conservatives have made transgender issues a focus of attacks and criticism, and some state legislatures have passed legislation about bathrooms. There have also been laws or rules targeting medical care for the trans community. Bud Light came under fire for its partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney this spring. Weeks after the online campaign, sales of Bud Light continue to plummet. Some conservatives reacted angrily to the partnership and vowed to buy other brands. Anheuser-Busch’s chief executive said that the brand “never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people.” Some gay bars in Chicago said they would boycott Bud Light after Anheuser-Busch distanced itself from Mulvaney. Mulvaney is best known for her “Days of Girlhood” TikTok series and partnered with the Anheuser-Busch during the NCAA’s March Madness basketball tournament. On May 31, President Joe Biden commemorated Pride Month in a statement in which he criticized “an onslaught of dangerous anti-LGBTQI+ legislation” introduced in states that he said targeted transgender children and their parents.

'Nobody imagined it would go on this long': Bud Light sales continue to plummet over Mulvaney backlash,Rob Wile,"May 23, 2023, 8:58 PM UTC",Consumer,"Sales of Bud Light continue to plummet, reflecting ongoing backlash to the brand's decision to hire transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney as a spokesperson. According to data cited by the beverage industry trade publication Beer Business Daily, sales volumes of Bud Light for the week ending May 13 sank 28.4%, extending a downward trend from the 27.7% decline seen the week before. At a time of profound cultural and political division in the U.S., light beer drinkers simply don't want to be drawn into another debate about values, said Beer Business Daily editor and publisher Harry Schuhmacher. ""Most people don’t care about this issue and don’t want to get roped into a conversation,"" Schuhmacher said. ""Therefore they're not going to buy the beer."" Given the wide array of choices available to beer drinkers, it's easy to switch brands, he said. A spokesperson for Anheuser-Busch InBev, Bud Light's parent company, did not respond to a request for comment. Mulvaney debuted her partnership with Bud Light the weekend of the NCAA Basketball Men's and Women's National Championship in early April. She shared a sponsored post on her Instagram account to her then-1.2 million followers promoting Bud Light’s March Madness contest. The social media backlash from conservatives, many of whom had previously targeted Mulvaney — best known for her “Days of Girlhood” TikTok series — was swift. Initially, Bud Light's response was to ignore the criticism, saying Mulvaney was simply one of hundreds of influencers it worked with. But as the crisis snowballed, it moved to place Alissa Heinerscheid —  the first woman ever in charge of Bud Light’s marketing — and her boss Daniel Blake on leave, multiple news outlets have reported. The story has only continued to grow amid the wider national debate over civil rights for transgender people, one that has seen multiple states pass laws restricting gender-affirming medical care and barring other resources from the trans community. AB InBev had previously partnered with the LGBTQ+ community, and had also worked with Mulvaney on another campaign, Schuhmacher said. The hit to Bud Light, he said, is simply a matter of wrong place and wrong time. ""It just seems like an unlucky draw,"" he said. ""The timing and the zeitgeist and the divided environment all combined to create this unbelievable boycott that nobody could have anticipated."" AB InBev shares have fallen more than 10% since Mulvaney's social media post went live. In a note to clients published Tuesday, JPMorgan analysts said that even if the decline in Bud Light sales stabilizes, ""We believe there is a subset [of] American consumers who will not drink Bud Light for the foreseeable future.” ""Nobody imagined it would go on this long,"" Schuhmacher said. He continued: ""It seems random — it struck a nerve. I've never seen anything to compare it to, in all of the [consumer packaged goods] industry. It’s a real shock."" "
Largest U.S. gay rights group issues Florida travel advisory,Associated Press,"May 23, 2023, 7:44 PM UTC",OUT Politics and Policy,"ORLANDO, Fla. — The largest LGBTQ rights organization in the U.S. joined other civil rights organizations Tuesday in issuing a travel advisory for Florida, warning that newly passed laws and policies may pose risks to minorities, immigrants and gay travelers. The Human Rights Campaign joined the NAACP, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Florida Immigrant Coalition and Equality Florida in issuing travel or relocation warnings for the Sunshine State, one of the most popular states for tourists to visit in the U.S. While the LGBTQ advocacy group said it wasn’t calling for a boycott or making a blanket recommendation against visiting Florida, it said it wanted to highlight new laws passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature that they said are hostile to the LGBTQ community, restrict abortion access and allow Floridians to carry concealed weapons without a permit. “Those who visit must join us in their vocal opposition to these dangerous policies,” Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. “Those who pick another place to work, to go to school or to spend their vacation should make clear why they’re not heading to Florida.” Last weekend, the NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, issued its advisory warning that recent laws and policies championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida lawmakers are “openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.” More than 137.5 million tourists visited Florida last year, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, according to Visit Florida, the state’s tourism promotion agency. Tourism supports 1.6 million full-time and part-time jobs, and visitors spent $98.8 billion in Florida in 2019, according to last year’s figures. "
Peloton aims to rebrand as a fitness company for all with a focus on app and tiered subscription pricing,"Gabrielle Fonrouge, CNBC","May 23, 2023, 7:16 PM UTC",Consumer,"When Peloton unveiled its 2019 holiday commercial depicting a husband who gifted his wife a stationary bike for Christmas, the ad was widely panned as sexist, dystopian and reminiscent of a hostage video. People took umbrage at the commercial’s characters — a white, upper-middle-class family — and said it sent a range of dangerous messages about everything from gender norms to body dysmorphia. While the controversy eventually faded from the headlines, the public remembered. The ad solidified Peloton’s nascent identity as a high-end bike company reserved for a certain type of person at a certain income level. Now, the company is ready to change that perception. Peloton on Tuesday is launching a new marketing campaign that bills the retailer as a company for anyone, regardless of age, fitness level and income — or whether they shelled out thousands for a pricey piece of equipment. The brand relaunch comes a little over a year into Barry McCarthy’s tenure as CEO. He has worked to transform Peloton from a hardware-focused company into one that’s just as invested in its app and the high-margin subscription revenue that it brings. Since McCarthy, a former Netflix and Spotify executive, replaced founder John Foley in February 2022, the company has been on the defense. It has worked to rein in its gargantuan costs, remedy recalls and find new revenue streams as demand for its connected fitness products slowed and consumers became more cautious about their discretionary spending. While the company has yet to return to profitability, it has managed to stop the bleeding. With a new marketing chief at the helm, Peloton says it’s ready to reintroduce itself to the world and shed the image the holiday ad seared into some minds. “We know that the perception externally does not match the reality of who we are,” Peloton’s chief marketing officer, Leslie Berland, who started with the company in January and led the relaunch, told CNBC in an interview. “This company historically has been thought of as an in-home bike company for fitness enthusiasts but over the years, it has evolved into something that is much more bigger, much broader than that.” The relaunch comes along with a new, tiered app strategy that includes an unlimited free membership option (with no credit card required) and levels that cost $12.99 and $24 monthly. The content people will have access to varies by the level and, in some cases, legacy users will have less access come December when a grace period ends. Currently, people who pay $12.99 a month to use the Peloton app can do a bike class every day, but in December, they’ll only be able to do three per month. The relaunch includes a “Gym” function that allows users to take Peloton’s app into the gym with them and create custom workouts. Peloton is also saying goodbye to its trademark fire engine red and black colors in favor of a new mix of hues it says better captures the “energy” of a workout and the “afterglow” that comes. New branding materials include shades of purple, pink, green and a lighter red. In a splashy 90-second marketing video shared with CNBC, Peloton’s app takes center stage. It shows people of all shapes, sizes, fitness abilities and ages using it to take strength and yoga classes at home, but also in gyms, which have long been considered a threat to Peloton’s business. While Peloton features its Bike, Tread and Row machines in the clip, it does not show the hardware until about 30 seconds into the video. The message is a far cry from Peloton’s earlier commercials and marketing materials, which predominantly featured ultra-fit athletes using its equipment. ″[We’re] now leaning in for the first time to the idea that OK, not everyone is going to bring premium Peloton hardware into their home,” Tom Cortese, Peloton’s co-founder and chief product officer, told CNBC in an interview. “Our members have a phone, we’re on their phone, they take their phone where they want to go and if you want to put [the Peloton app] on someone else’s hardware, that’s fine, and if you want to bring it into someone else’s gym, that’s great.” Peloton insisted the focus on selling subscriptions does not mean it has abandoned its hardware business, and said the company is on a dual track with both. The new campaign focuses on the app because there’s been so little advertising of it, and market research shows just 4% of consumers know about it, the company said. “When we first started coming out of Covid, and the press likes to be tough on Peloton, it was ‘everyone’s going back to the gyms’ but we know that our members were using our products in the gym,” said Jennifer Cotter, Peloton’s chief content officer. She pointed out that Peloton’s strength training content, not its cycling or running classes, is the No. 1 type of class for digital members and the No. 2 among those who have Peloton hardware. It shows how eager users are to consume Peloton content that has nothing to do with its equipment. “When it comes to this initiative, we’re just excited that No. 1, our members will feel reflected and new members will feel like Peloton is for them,” said Cotter. “And then, you know, the tiering structure allows us to welcome people up the ramp.” Briana Deserio, 32, has been a Peloton member since the early days of the pandemic. She said the brand’s competitive and aspirational appeal originally led her to buy a Bike. When briefed about the company’s new marketing strategy, she said she supports the move and its focus on being inclusive. But she said there’s a chance making Peloton accessible to everyone could dilute its brand. “It’s kind of like a club and now everyone’s coming into the club,” said Deserio. Berland, Peloton’s new marketing chief, isn’t concerned about the brand losing strength. She said the new marketing strategy reflects what the company already is. “Our members, our instructors, our classes, our content. That is unchanged. The company has evolved into all of this,” said Berland. “It’s time for the brand and the marketing to represent all of that and all of its vibrancy.” Liz Coddington, Peloton’s chief financial officer, said creating different points of entry to the company’s content will set it up for long-term growth. “What we’re doing is we are opening up the total addressable market to Peloton to people who may not have considered us in the past because we weren’t really speaking to them,” said Coddington. “The real goal truly is just to bring more people into the ecosystem of Peloton however they want to come in, and then help them on their journey in how they want to consume our content over time, whether it’s through the free option, through the lower tier or through the higher tier or eventually buying or renting our hardware,” she said. The company has not incorporated potential upside from the app and marketing strategy into its financial outlook, and said some paid app members will likely downgrade to the free membership option. In the past, churn rates have briefly spiked when Peloton changed prices, but soon returned to typical levels, she said. “We are optimistic about it,” said Coddington. “But it’s hard to know until we know.” "
Netflix password sharing crackdown rolls out in the U.S.,"Lillian Rizzo, CNBC","May 23, 2023, 6:45 PM UTC",Consumer,"Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing has come to the U.S. The streaming service said it began alerting members on Tuesday about its new sharing policy, noting that Netflix accounts are only to be shared within one household. “Your Netflix account is for you and the people you live with — your household,” the company said in an email, which it posted to its blog on Tuesday. The email goes on to say that members can transfer a profile of someone outside of their household so the person can begin a new membership they pay for on their own. Or they can pay an extra fee — $7.99 a month — per person outside of their household using their account. On Netflix’s subscription plans page, it notes that extra members can be added to its standard and premium plans without ads. Netflix warned it would be tightening its guidelines on password sharing in a push to boost revenue and subscriber numbers, soon after the company began seeing growth stagnate. Originally, Netflix was expected to rollout its crackdown on people who borrow other accounts to create their own profiles in late in the first quarter, but alerted investors and customers during an earnings call last month that it was pushing it until the second quarter. The company has said than more than 100 million households share accounts, which is about 43% of its global user base. Due to this, Netflix said it has affected its ability to invest in new content. Earlier this year Netflix outlined password-sharing guidance in four other countries: New Zealand, Canada, Portugal and Spain. Netflix said it would ask members in those countries to set a “primary location” for their accounts, and allow users to establish two sub accounts for those who don’t live in their home base for extra fees. Read more: Netflix’s expected password-sharing crackdown puts college students on edge In Tuesday’s notice, the company didn’t provide such specifics for U.S. households, and rather gave the two options of either transferring a profile or paying a fee for an extra member. The company said it had seen its subscriber growth impacted internationally where it already rolled out such initiatives during the first quarter. But Netflix still managed to add 1.75 million customers during the quarter. In Latin America, Netflix executives said it saw cancellations after the news was announced, affecting near-term growth. But, those password borrowers would later activate their own accounts and add existing members as “extra member” accounts. As a result, the company has seen more revenue, they said. Netflix executives have likened the paid sharing transition to that of price increases: people initially balk and cancel, then slowly return and sign up for their own accounts. In addition to its crackdown on password sharing, Netflix also recently introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier in an effort to boost revenue. Both measures came in response shortly after Netflix reported its first subscriber loss in more than a decade in early 2022. Media companies across the board have been looking for ways to make their streaming plays profitable, leaning on methods such as content cost-cutting, advertising and finding other ways to attract more customers to their platforms. On Tuesday, Warner Bros. Discovery relaunched its streaming service as Max, which is a combination of its HBO Max and Discovery+ services. Paramount Global also announced this week that its Paramount+ with Showtime combined app would be available in late June. Disney has also recently announced it’s adding Hulu content to Disney+. "

Kylie Allen, owner of the West Virginia-based bakery Kylie’s Kakes, posted a video last month about a dispute with a dissatisfied customer over an $84 rainbow sprinkle cake, which spiraled into a controversy users deemed “cakegate.” Weeks later, a TikTok user by the name of Courtney Monteith’s video about a Canada-based tattoo artist charging high design fees turned into “tattoogate.” Videos about these incidents have racked up millions of views on TikTok, with most people showing support for the customer. These viral sagas, according to marketing experts, highlight the need for businesses to educate themselves about social media marketing and create policies around platforms and managing customer complaints. While TikTok has proven to be a powerful tool for small businesses, users on the app can tear businesses down as quickly as they can uplift them, especially when customer complaints — and business owners’ subsequent reactions — go viral. In some instances, such unwanted attention can also result in death threats against the owners, harassment and review bombing. “As a business, you need to have a policy on how you manage unhappy and dissatisfied customers,” said Angeli Gianchandani, marketing professor at the University of New Haven. “And, when you identify that and you make good with the consumer, it won’t spiral.” Sometimes, when it comes to the internet, that may mean refraining from engaging directly with your audience in the wake of sudden backlash. On TikTok, a user’s video complaint can be picked up by the algorithm and stretched out for days, oftentimes making it difficult for business owners to manage the backlash. Positive testimonials can get drowned out by one negative review with just one viral post. Sometimes, the business owners inadvertently shine the spotlight on their wrongdoings themselves. “You might just let it play out, unfortunate as that might be,” said Josh Rosenberg, CEO of Day One Agency, which focuses on digital marketing, public relations and social media. You might just let it play out, unfortunate as that might be. -Josh Rosenberg, CEO of Day One Agency, a marketing agency This doesn’t mean an owner should ignore the feedback. Rather, they should try their best to resolve the customer’s issue privately, and if the criticism continues, it may be best to disengage. In Allen’s video, which received over 9 million views, she said her customer “got super defensive and very rude about the price of the cake, although this is exactly how we decorate all of our rainbow cakes.” The customer responded with a video showing the cake, which she said was low quality for the price. Many viewers agreed with the customer, which led to discourse over whether Allen was in the wrong for her criticism in the first place. Allen declined a request for comment. In an interview with the “Baking For Business Podcast,” she said that she was “ashamed” with how she handled the situation and “would never make another video” like the one that sparked ""Cakegate."" The controversy ultimately did not hurt Kylie’s Kakes financially, Allen said, because the people weighing in online were not her target customer base in West Virginia. Still, Rosenberg said, “in business, you should always take the high road.” “If you are running a small business, you do need to really build those true authentic relationships with your customers and talking negatively about them probably isn’t the best approach,” he said. Ultimately, the best thing business owners can do is focus on “creating a product worth advocating for,” Rosenberg said. Meanwhile, ""tattoogate"" demonstrated why entrepreneurs should be utilizing social media to partake in the online conversation about their businesses, according to Emma Ferrara, chief business development officer at marketing agency Viral Nation. “The beauty of social is that people want to get that behind-the-scenes access,” said Ferrara. “They want to be a part of the journey. But with that, I think it’s important to understand that your social platform is there to really help to maintain your company’s reputation.” Monteith, whose first video complaining about her tattoo experience garnered over 5 million views, said she paid $180 for a consultation with an artist whom she didn’t name. She said she also paid $1,000 for a deposit and $1,500 design fee, an additional charge that other artists say is unconventional in the tattooing industry. Monteith, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, said she ended up not getting the tattoo — but was out over $2,600. Many users who rallied behind Monteith quickly discovered the name of the artist, who was not on TikTok, as well as the business’ name. The artist did not respond to a request for comment. Ferrara said getting on social platforms like TikTok “could also be an opportunity to be really clear about your services and what you charge for and what you don’t, so you don’t have any misunderstandings or anything that’s unclear.” However, she said, owners should create guidelines for how to conduct themselves online when posting from their business pages. “Can you perhaps build yourself kind of a do’s and don’ts policy list for yourself?” Ferrera said. “So when you’re posting these things, or when you’re creating your content strategy, it’s something that you can reference and go back to.” Ferrara added that business owners should maintain the same level of customer service online as they would offline. “The customer’s always right, even if they’re not always right,” she said.

A Black professor has long said what the IRS now admits: The tax system is biased,Char Adams,"May 23, 2023, 4:30 PM UTC",NBCBLK,"The Internal Revenue Service is increasingly acknowledging the presence of racial bias in the nation’s tax system — along with the years of work by pioneering researchers who’ve spent years highlighting the issue. In a letter sent last week to the Senate Finance Committee, the agency said Black taxpayers are far more likely to be audited than non-Black ones, exposing them to tax penalties. And in January, the Treasury Department revealed that a swath of tax breaks disproportionately benefit white people, leaving many Black people with hefty tax bills and little money left over. “We are deeply concerned by these findings and committed to doing the work to understand and address any disparate impact of the actions we take,” IRS commissioner Daniel Werfel wrote in a letter to Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Werfel’s letter cited a study on race and tax audits from Stanford University that attributed the disproportionate auditing of Black taxpayers partly to audit selection algorithms that target specific discrepancies rather than total underreporting. The study prompted a sharp rebuke of the system from Wyden and a vow from the IRS to use its $80 billion Inflation Reduction Act funding to make the tax system more equitable. But as the Stanford scholars noted, in a nod to “seminal” research that helped inspire their work, Dorothy Brown, a Black tax law professor at Georgetown University, has been debunking the myth of a race-neutral tax system for years. Her 2021 book, “The Whiteness of Wealth,” explores the ways U.S. tax policy impoverishes Black people and widens the racial wealth gap in multiple ways, including disparities in tax breaks and exclusion from some benefits. “It’s very gratifying,” Brown said in an interview. “One of the things I wanted to do with ‘The Whiteness of Wealth’ was inspire other people to take my work a step further, which is what the authors of the Stanford study did. The co-authors of the study have been steadfast in giving me credit for motivating their work. And I so respect them for that.” NBC News spoke with Brown about the conclusions of her research and policies to address it. NBC News: What was your reaction to IRS’s commissioner Daniel Werfel’s letter acknowledging that Black taxpayers are audited at higher rates? Dorothy Brown: I thought it was a big deal that the IRS finally acknowledged that race has played a role in their enforcement activities. They came out and validated the results of the Stanford study that showed that if you were Black and filed for the Earned Income Tax Credit you were three to five times more likely to be audited. In years past, the former IRS commissioner testified before Congress that the IRS doesn’t discriminate or treat anyone differently based on race and it’s obvious that simply isn’t true. So that this new commissioner acknowledged that is a big deal. NBC News: What do you consider some of the biggest aspects of taxation that target Black people or make us particularly vulnerable? Dorothy Brown: The way you get to pay fewer taxes is to have income from stock or gifts and inheritance. And we know that, given the racial wealth gap, gifts and inheritances are going to disproportionately benefit white Americans. So to the extent that Black Americans get most of our income from wages that are taxed at the highest rates and not income from stocks, Black people are left behind. There’s a singles penalty. If I’m single and I earn $50,000, my tax bill is gonna be higher than if I’m married and I earn $50,000 and have a stay-at-home spouse. Black Americans are more likely to be single so we pay the singles penalty. Every [Tax Day on] April 15, Black family wealth gets depleted. So over generations, it’s just wealth depletion, wealth depletion. Whereas for white Americans, every April 15 it’s wealth building, wealth building. The tax system right now is a builder of wealth for some people and a depleter of wealth for others. NBC News: The IRS says it doesn’t collect information on race or ethnicity from taxpayers. So how have you found that these racial disparities have been able to persist for decades? Dorothy Brown: It’s an example that systems of oppression operate whether there’s intent to oppress or not. The fact of the absence of race data by the IRS doesn’t mean tax law operates in a colorblind manner. The IRS’ defense was: We couldn’t possibly be discriminating because we don’t have your race. But here’s why I never bought that: What the tax return has is ZIP code data and first and last name. If you give me a ZIP code, I can tell you racial information about who’s living there. Even though the IRS says we don’t collect race, the tax return has information that’s a pretty decent proxy for race. NBC News: What gave you the idea initially that race wasn’t a significant factor in taxation and what changed that for you? Dorothy Brown: In the tax courses I took in law school, race was never mentioned. In fact, the way we were taught, and this is my takeaway, was that the only color that mattered was greed. It wasn’t until I became a law professor and read an article by a mentor that, toward the end of the article, said, “How do you know there isn’t a race and tax problem, if you don’t look?” I picked up the phone, called the mentor and said, “I don’t know what I’m gonna find, but I’m gonna look!” And the rest is history. I call myself an accidental race and tax scholar. NBC News: In your book you wrote, “Taxpayers bring their racial identities to their tax returns.” What did you mean by that and why are those racial identities important in the tax system? Dorothy Brown: The first thing is we bring our address. We live in a racially segregated society so where I live has a lot to do with my race. Where I work and get a W-2 has a lot to do with my race —  occupational segregation. There are certain jobs that are disproportionately white and there are jobs that are disproportionately Black and the jobs that tend to be disproportionately white tend to come with tax-free benefits like retirement accounts and health insurance. And there are other jobs that are disproportionately Black that do not come with those tax-free benefits. So being Black in the world translates into our tax returns in a way that makes it more likely for Black Americans to pay higher taxes than their peers. We’re bringing our racial identities onto our tax returns because our tax laws operate differently based upon a taxpayer’s race. NBC News: What are some ways we could begin to address and correct these disparities? Dorothy Brown: Here’s my fix, tax income from stock at the same rate as income from labor. No tax loopholes for income from stock, because that tax loophole associated with stock goes to white Americans. Another fix I would have is enforcement. Require the IRS to annually report on its enforcement activities by race. If they find a disparity, they fix it and they transparently tell us how they’re going to fix it. CORRECTION (May 23, 9:00 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the university where Dorothy Brown is a professor. She is a faculty member at Georgetown University, not Emory University. "
Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez are engaged,"Ariana Brockington, TODAY","May 23, 2023, 3:30 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez are headed down the aisle. The Amazon founder, 59, and the Emmy-winning journalist, 53, are engaged, TODAY.com has confirmed. The two have been linked since January 2019, when People first reported they were dating. The pair regularly post about each other on social media. Sánchez made one of her first appearances on Bezos’ Instagram page in February 2020 when the couple visited French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss climate and sustainability. Bezos and Sanchez work together on the Bezos Earth Fund, where Bezos is executive chair and Sánchez is vice chair. Since then, the two frequently upload sweet photos together. In January, Sánchez penned a heartfelt birthday message to Bezos, calling him “the man of (her) dreams.” “You have shown me that no great love is not bravely fought for,” she wrote in the caption beside a carousel of moments they’ve shared. “Thank you for always being by my side and for being the most loving and supportive partner. I am so grateful for the memories we have made and the adventures yet to come. Here’s to many more birthdays filled with love and laughter.” At the end of her post, she wrote in Spanish that she loved the entrepreneur with all her heart. In February, she shared more pictures from their adventures for Valentine’s Day. “My heart is full,” she captioned the slideshow. For Mother’s Day, Bezos paid tribute on Instagram to Sánchez and all the other important women in his life. “Happy Mother’s Day to my beautiful, incredible mom, and to all the amazing moms in my life. I love you, Mom!” he said and included a photo of him standing beside Sánchez, his mom, Jacklyn Bezos, and four other women. The former Amazon CEO was previously married to MacKenzie Scott from 1993 to 2019. When they separated, Scott’s 4% stake in Amazon was worth more than $36 billion, making their settlement the most expensive divorce in history. Scott and Bezos share three sons and one daughter together, according to People. Sánchez was once married to Hollywood agent Patrick Whitesell, whom she wed in 2005 and divorced in 2019. The former couple are parents to two children. She is also mom to 22-year-old son Nikko Gonzalez, whom she shares with former partner and retired NFL player Tony Gonzalez. "
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City and disrupts travel at two major airports,Erick Mendoza,"May 23, 2023, 2:36 AM UTC",Mexico,"The eruptive volcano named Popocatépetl continued to impact air travel in Mexico City on Monday after it caused weekend flight cancellations and delays. On Monday, AeroMexico, the country's national airline, blamed the 17,887-foot volcano's spring outbursts for affecting more than 100 of its flights across that nation. Sergio Salomón, governor of the Mexican state of Puebla, tweeted Monday that he held a meeting of his advisors to plan a response to the eruptions should they continue during the week. Activity coming from the volcano, named ""smoking mountain"" in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec people, was noted by NASA scientists April 14. A satellite operated by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey captured images of some of the volcano's spring outburst, and Mexican scientists have detected water vapor, volcanic gases and ash coming from the volcano, NASA said in two updates earlier this month. Researchers have measured plumes as high as 4.5 miles, NASA said. On Monday, the USGS published a computer model forecast that stated the area just south of Mexico City could see 10 to 32 mm of ash fall by day's end. Popocatépetl's ash was enough to prompt suspension of flights for about 5 hours at both of Mexico City's main airports on Saturday. Benito Juarez International Airport said ash can block pilots' view, hinder radio communications, and affect passenger planes' jet engines. Popocatépetl, which has a sibling, Iztaccíhuatl, about 8 miles north, has been noted by humans for its huffing and puffing since the 14th century, according to the Smithsonian Institution. Its latest string of eruptions dates to 2005, according to NASA. "
"Biden and McCarthy hold a 'productive' debt ceiling meeting, but no deal yet",Sahil Kapur,"May 22, 2023, 2:37 PM UTC / Updated May 23, 2023, 12:44 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — A meeting between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Monday afternoon to discuss a path forward to avert a debt limit breach failed to yield a deal, but both sides agreed that talks were ""productive."" ""We don’t have an agreement yet, but I did feel the discussion was productive in areas that we have differences of opinion,” McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters after leaving the Oval Office. He added that the “tone tonight was better than any other night we’ve had discussions.” A White House official said disagreements remain, but echoed the speaker’s assessment that the meeting was overall “productive,” a word that continued to surface as negotiators fanned out. It was a “solid” and “respectful” conversation, the official said. Biden, who did not make public remarks, repeated in a statement the assessment that talks were “productive,” adding that talks between staff negotiators would continue. With only days left until the June 1 deadline when the Treasury Department may be unable to pay the nation’s bills, urgency is mounting for Biden and McCarthy to find a path to raising the government’s borrowing limit. McCarthy repeatedly stopped short of assuring that the two sides would reach a deal in time, saying he wished they had started negotiating before the final hour. He ruled out cuts to military spending as well as new revenues to reduce the deficit, which — along with his promise not to cut Social Security and Medicare — leaves a limited slice of the U.S. domestic budget on the chopping block. McCarthy also said he doesn't support a short-term extension of the debt limit deadline, to buy the two sides time, and promised to honor the 72-hour rule to give members time to read an agreement before voting on a bill. Biden said before the meeting he was “optimistic” about progress and told reporters in the Oval Office that default was not an option. “The American people would have a real kick in their economic wellbeing,” Biden said. “As a matter of fact, the rest of the world would too.” Asked whether an agreement on overall spending could break the logjam, Biden said “that alone” would not suffice. The president said he also wanted to close tax “loopholes and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share."" The two sides agreed that reducing the deficit is a priority, he said, but are at odds over spending cuts and measures to raise revenue. “While there are areas of disagreement, the Speaker and I, and his lead negotiators Chairman McHenry and Congressman Graves, and our staffs will continue to discuss the path forward,” Biden said in the statement. “We do have disagreements,” said McCarthy, adding that revenue had grown. But the speaker said he and Biden “both agree that we need to change the trajectory, that our debt is too large.” Earlier, McCarthy has said he’s insisting on an agreement to “spend less” than current levels in a deal, although he was mum when asked if the total amount would be somewhere in between this year and fiscal 2022 levels. McCarthy drew a line against cuts to military spending prior to meeting with Biden: “I don’t think you should put America in jeopardy. To me, it is off the table.” The White House is eyeing health savings as one area for compromise with Republicans as the two sides seek to bridge a policy gap trillions of dollars wide, according to a source familiar with the talks. The savings would target areas of federal programs, like Medicare Part B, where the government is seen as overpaying private healthcare companies, this source said. Most importantly, the source said, such “savings” would be considered “revenue” for Democrats in these negotiations — allowing both sides a win. A major outstanding question is whether Biden and McCarthy can reach a deal that has the votes to pass the Republican-led House and Democratic-controlled Senate in a short period of time. And if a bill is passed with mostly Democratic votes in the House, will McCarthy face an uprising from his hard-line members. A push for sharper budget cuts has become a source of tension inside the Republican caucus, as some conservatives fear McCarthy may be willing to strike a deal with Biden that doesn’t go far enough. A White House official said before the sit down that a “reasonable compromise” was still attainable, despite the obstacles in reaching a deal both sides can agree to. The hope is that Biden and McCarthy can come to an agreement on spending, the official said. McCarthy had said he hoped they would find “common ground” on a deal that would lift the ceiling while working to curb inflation, reduce dependence on China and make the congressional spending process ""work.” The speaker has said that “decisions have to be made” in time to avoid a crisis, and that he understands Republicans “don’t control the Senate and we don’t control the presidency.” McCarthy will have to navigate the demands of conservative hard-liners in his narrow majority, who are pressing for stricter spending cuts and say that the House-passed bill, called the Limit, Save, Grow Act, should be the standard to which they hold any deal. Biden is facing angst from his party’s left flank over his entertaining some GOP demands, such as stricter work requirements for federal aid programs. Many progressives, uneasy with the negotiations, have called on the president to invoke the 14th Amendment and tackle the debt ceiling unilaterally. “I’m looking at the 14th Amendment as to whether or not we have the authority. I think we have the authority,” Biden said Sunday at a news conference in Hiroshima. “The question is: Could it be done and invoked in time that it could not, would not be appealed, and as a consequence, pass the date in question, and still default on the debt? That’s a question that I think is unresolved.” The meeting followed a frantic few days of staff-level negotiations between the White House and Republican leaders. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., adjourned the chamber last week for a pre-scheduled recess but told senators to be ready to return within 24 hours’ notice. Negotiations had hit turbulence in recent days over the core dispute of how much the federal government should spend in the next fiscal year. McCarthy and Republicans want a substantial cut that Democrats have been reluctant to grant. Democrats calculate that Republicans are proposing discretionary spending cuts of 22% if military programs are exempted, as many in the GOP want. Speaking in Hiroshima, Japan, Sunday, Biden argued that Republicans’ “extreme positions” were holding up progress. “I’ve done my part,” Biden told reporters. “Now it’s time for the other side to move. There are more extreme positions, because much of what they’ve already proposed is simply, quite frankly, unacceptable.” On Biden’s way back Sunday from the G-7 summit in Japan, he had a phone call with McCarthy that the speaker described as “very productive” and included a request from the president to meet. Arriving at the Capitol on Monday morning, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., a McCarthy ally, told reporters that the call “got us back in the room together."" Biden over the weekend had appeared less certain that Republicans would do whatever was needed to avert default, warning that “he can’t guarantee” Republicans won’t force a situation where the government is unable to pay its bills. But the president on Monday said he and McCarthy had discussed “the need for bipartisan agreement"" that could pass both chambers. “We have to be in the position where we can sell it to our constituencies,” Biden said. “We are pretty well divided in the House, almost down the middle. And it’s not any different in the Senate. So we got to get something we can sell to both sides.” "
TikTok files lawsuit against Montana over download ban,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 22, 2023, 7:59 PM UTC / Updated May 22, 2023, 9:47 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"TikTok filed a lawsuit against Montana on Monday over a new law  aimed at stopping people from downloading the app, arguing the ban violates the First Amendment. ""We are challenging Montana’s unconstitutional TikTok ban to protect our business and the hundreds of thousands of TikTok users in Montana,"" a spokesperson for the company said after the suit was filed.  ""We believe our legal challenge will prevail based on an exceedingly strong set of precedents and facts."" TikTok is seeking an ""order invalidating and preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendant from enforcing the TikTok Ban,"" according to the complaint. Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a bill last week restricting downloads of the immensely popular social media app into law, making Montana the first state to ban TikTok. The law makes it illegal for app stores to give users the option to download TikTok and illegal for the company to operate within the state. In addition to First Amendment concerns, the complaint states that the ban violates a federal preemption, meaning matters of national security and foreign affairs are carried out by the federal government rather than the states. It also says Montana is in violation of the constitution's Commerce Clause, which limits a state's authority ""to enact legislation that unduly burdens interstate and foreign commerce."" Finally, the complaint states that the bill unfairly singles out TikTok ""for purely punitive reasons, as evidenced by the State’s decision to single out Plaintiff for harsh penalties based on speculative concerns about TikTok’s data security and content moderation practices"" rather than social media companies as a whole. Early this month, Gianforte drafted an amendment to the bill that would have changed its language to target all social media, rather than just TikTok. However, the amendment language did not make it into the final bill because the legislature adjourned before it sent the bill to his desk. Representatives for Gianforte did not immediately return a request for comment. Emily Flower, spokeswoman for Attorney General Austin Knudsen said that the office had anticipated legal challenges to the law. “The Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok as a tool to spy on Americans by collecting personal information, keystrokes, and even the locations of its users — and by extension, people without TikTok who affiliate with users may have information about themselves shared without evening knowing it,"" Flower said in a statement Monday. ""We expected legal challenges and are fully prepared to defend the law that helps protect Montanans’ privacy and security.” Violations of a ban include every time a user is offered the ability to download the app. Each violation could carry a $10,000 penalty. Enforcement would be handled by the Montana Justice Department. It is scheduled to take effect  Jan. 1, 2024. TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter previously called the bill “unlawful,"" saying the app is a platform that “empowers hundreds of thousands of people across the state.” “We want to reassure Montanans that they can continue using TikTok to express themselves, earn a living, and find community as we continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana,” Oberwetter said in a statement Wednesday. The lawsuit is the second filed against the state’s new bill. This week, five TikTok content creators — Samantha Alario, Heather DiRocco, Carly Ann Goddard, Alice Held and Dale Stout — also sued the state, claiming the ban attempts to suppress speech and “exercises power over national security that Montana does not have.” “Montana’s blanket ban prevents our clients, and all Montanans, from engaging in protected speech,” said Ambika Kumar, lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Montana suit. “We are determined to see that this misguided and invalid law is permanently enjoined.” In response to the creators' lawsuit, Emily Flower, spokeswoman for the Montana Department of Justice, said: “We expected a legal challenge and are fully prepared to defend the law.” "
Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav booed at Boston University graduation amid writers strike,Julianne McShane,"May 22, 2023, 7:54 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A Hollywood studio head was met with jeers and protests when he delivered the commencement address for Boston University on Sunday amid the ongoing Hollywood writers strike. BU students booed and turned their backs on David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, as he delivered the commencement address at Nickerson Field, the school stadium. Others protested outside ceremony on a picket line with an inflatable rat, NBC Boston reported. Videos circulating on social media appeared to show BU students at the commencement ceremony chanting ""Pay your writers"" as school officials introduced Zaslav ahead of his speech; other video appeared to show the protesters outside the stadium demanding a contract. The protests come as the writers' strike stretches into its third week. Unionized writers brought television production to a halt earlier this month when they started their strike, saying they are not being paid fairly. The choice of Zaslav as commencement speaker drew protests before he even set foot on campus. Several student clubs on campus launched a campaign to cancel his speech before it occurred, according to the student newspaper the Daily Free Press. BU President Robert Brown told the student newspaper prior to the commencement ceremony that university officials believed Zaslav’s “accomplishments are worthy of our recognition and that our graduates will find his personal story interesting and inspiring.” Zaslav graduated from the BU School of Law, according to his biography. Prior to working at Discovery, Zaslav was an executive at NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. In one clip of the commencement address posted to social media, Zaslav quoted the late General Electric CEO Jack Welch, saying Welch told him, “If you want to be successful, you’re going to have to figure out how to get along with everyone — and that includes difficult people.” Students responded with a coordinated chant of, ""Pay your writers!"" ""Some people will be looking for a fight,"" Zaslav continued, prompting boos. In a statement released after the event, Zaslav said: “I am grateful to my alma mater, Boston University, for inviting me to be part of today’s commencement and for giving me an honorary degree, and, as I have often said, I am immensely supportive of writers and hope the strike is resolved soon and in a way that they feel recognizes their value."" During an appearance on CNBC earlier this month, in which he discussed his company's first-quarter $50 million profit, Zaslav said the compensation disputes stem from ongoing changes in the industry, citing the rise of streaming platforms and different content sources. ""The industry is in the middle of some significant disruption, and people are changing the way they consume content, and so it's very difficult to figure out, how does that work, what's the right value for it,"" Zaslav said. The Writers Guild of America, East tweeted Sunday afternoon that it was “thankful to all the B.U. graduates for chanting 'Pay your writers' at Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav while he delivered the #BU2023 commencement address.” The protesters also received support from some Democratic politicians. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a BU alum, retweeted a video of BU students chanting “Pay your writers!” during Zaslav’s speech, and added the comment, “Go Terriers!” Senator Bernie Sanders also tweeted his support for the protesters, writing: “If Warner Bros Discovery can afford to pay its CEO David Zaslav $286 million in compensation over the past 2 years, it can afford to pay its writers much better wages and benefits. Mr. Zaslav: Listen to the Boston University students and the Writers Guild. Pay your writers.” Representatives for Boston University did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday afternoon. "
Troubled regional lender PacWest sells $2.6 billion loans at discount,Reuters,"May 22, 2023, 7:31 PM UTC",Corporations,"PacWest Bancorp, one of the lenders seeking to survive the U.S. regional banking crisis, said on Monday it had agreed to sell a $2.6 billion real estate construction loan portfolio at a discount in a bid to improve its balance sheet. PacWest’s shares rose 15% on the deal, which gives the California-focused bank breathing space to cope with a flight of deposits that followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other regional peers over the last two months. PacWest has lost three-quarters of its market value since the regional banking crisis started on March 8. It lost 16.9% of its total deposit base at the outset, and has been trying to claw some of it back. PacWest sold 74 real estate construction loans that have an outstanding balance of $2.6 billion to property firm Kennedy-Wilson Holdings for $2.4 billion -- a $200 million discount, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. Kennedy-Wilson said it will also assume $2.7 billion in potential funding obligations associated with the loans, and will take over, subject to clearances secured by PacWest, an additional six real estate construction loans with a balance of about $363 million. PacWest will have to pay Kennedy-Wilson a fee equal to 0.15% of the total commitments of the loans, according to the filing. The loans carry floating interest rates that currently average 8.4%, substantially higher than PacWest’s fixed-rate loan portfolio, which was put together when interest rates were much lower. The floating rates allowed PacWest to sell the real estate construction loans at a small discount that reflected a decline in the value of the underlying real estate assets, rather than the rise in interest rates. “We believe the decline in risk-weighted assets should offset the loss (from the sale of the loans at a discount), which should result in modest improvement in regulatory capital ratios,” Wedbush analysts wrote in a note. The transaction is expected to close in multiple tranches during the second quarter and early part of the third quarter, PacWest said. The Los Angeles-based lender has also said it is exploring a sale of its $2.7 billion lender finance loan portfolio, which it expects to have completed by next month. “It takes pressure off the bank from the funding side as they dispose off these loans — they won’t have to use either extensive deposits or borrowings to fund that part of the portfolio,” said Gary Tenner, managing director at D.A. Davidson & Co. PacWest had indicated in May it was in talks with potential partners and investors about strategic options. Earlier this month, it said it had posted more collateral to the U.S. Federal Reserve to boost the bank’s liquidity.

After spending half a year on discovery and enlisting the help of a forensic accountant, the New York housewife eventually tracked down 12 bitcoins — then worth half a million dollars — in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet. Sarita, who was married for a decade and asked to use a pseudonym to protect herself from retaliation, said she felt blindsided by her husband’s cryptocurrency investment. “I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn’t know much about it,” Sarita said. “It was never even a thought in my mind, because it’s not like we were discussing it or making investments together. ... It was definitely a shock.” The world of financial infidelity has become increasingly sophisticated, as investors “hop” coins across blockchains and sink their cash into metaverse properties. An NBC News poll found that 1 in 5 Americans have invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, with men between the ages of 18 and 49 accounting for the highest share of all demographic groups. CNBC spoke with divorce attorneys from Florida, New York, Texas and California, blockchain forensic investigators, financial advisors, as well as spouses who were either hunting down virtual coins or the crypto holders themselves. Most agree that the law can’t keep up with all the new ways that people earn and safeguard digital assets that largely exist outside the reach of centralized intermediaries such as banks. Family and marital law attorney Kim Nutter said she first dove into the crypto vernacular in 2015 but that the state of Florida, where her practice is based, only recently inserted “cryptocurrency” into the standard request for production of documents — a key part of establishing the couple’s marital property during the discovery process. “I really still think the law is trying to catch up with this novel form of currency, even though it’s been around for quite a while,” Nutter said. “What I find in litigation is because this is so new to all of us, even the most seasoned attorneys — unless you’re really going out of your way to study this — educating the court, knowing what to ask for, and finding the right experts, it’s much more of a scramble to me than other areas of law which had been around much longer,” she said. Hunting hidden crypto stashes in divorce has created an entirely new job category of forensic investigators. CNBC spoke with several of these crypto hunters, and they say that while the blockchain is a public ledger, some spouses have become very good at covering their financial tracks. “If you have a spouse that’s very tech savvy, and one that isn’t, it can be somewhat easy to hide those assets,” divorce attorney Kelly Burris told CNBC. “The thing with cryptocurrency is it’s not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can’t subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody’s cryptocurrency holdings,” Burris said. She said she sees explicit cryptocurrency requests in discovery in 40% to 50% of her cases. The Austin, Texas-based attorney told CNBC that the ideal way to get information on a spouse’s crypto holdings is to subpoena that information from a centralized crypto exchange. Otherwise, the process often involves a forensic analysis of their computer or phone to identify a wallet address and then a subsequent blockchain analysis. “Crypto asset forensics, cryptocurrency forensics, and blockchain forensics have become a significant part of our practice and by far, the fastest growing part of our practice,” said Nick Himonidis, a New York-based forensic investigator. Himonidis, who is also a licensed private investigator and a computer forensic expert, estimates that 25% of his divorce-related cases involve some elements of cryptocurrency. Some of those cases, he said, are simple and straightforward — situations where, for example, a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin is a custodial asset held in a brokerage account or on a trading platform such as Coinbase. “These companies keep records just like your broker at Morgan Stanley would keep records of your trades,” he said. Other cases are what Himonidis describes as the “whole enchilada.” “They’re calling us because they want to get us appointed as the neutral forensic cryptocurrency expert to marshal and account for the party’s crypto assets and track down any undisclosed crypto assets that one party may have,” he said. When Himonidis first got into hunting crypto, it was all about bitcoin, ether and a handful of other coins. CoinMarketCap now lists more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies, with a collective market cap of $1.1 trillion. “There’s not just a couple of blockchains to worry about anymore. There’s hundreds and hundreds of coins out there on their own little independent blockchains,” he said. One of the core tenets of bitcoin is that its public ledger, which stores all token transactions in its history, is visible to everyone. But there is a subset of cryptocurrencies known as privacy tokens, which have anonymity features built into them. Coins such as monero, dash and zcash, which operate on their own blockchains, disguise practically all transaction details, including the identity of the sender and recipient, as well as the transaction amount. Himonidis said it is “virtually impossible” to trace and de-anonymize transactions in monero. In one case, Himonidis found around $700,000 worth of monero on a MacBook that turned up in discovery. “We found something called a command line wallet for monero,” Himonidis said, describing it as a kind of software wallet. “You can’t find it with the Finder on the Mac. You need to go into a command line prompt to access this wallet — a Bash shell command on a Mac environment.” Multiple investigators and attorneys told CNBC that they are always on the lookout for any type of crypto — but particularly privacy tokens. There is also special attention paid to any kind of hardware wallet or computing device, which can double as a form of “cold storage” for cryptocurrencies. People who hold their own cryptocurrency can store it “hot,” “cold” or some combination of the two. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows owners relatively easy access to their coins so they can spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors — and forensic investigators working for divorce attorneys. With cold storage, the private keys — or the passwords that enable the crypto to be moved out of the wallet — are stored on devices, such as computers, that are not connected to the internet. Thumb drive-size devices, such as a Trezor or Ledger, offer another way to secure crypto tokens cold by safeguarding both the crypto itself and the keys to access it. Mark DiMichael, who has been in the forensic accounting field for more than 14 years and is a certified cryptocurrency forensic investigator, described one case to CNBC in which a divorcing couple had a stand-off over a password-protected Ledger device. In the case, DiMichael said, the husband had a Ledger and then the wife found the device in the house and took it. “So the wife had the Ledger, but she didn’t know the pin number, or password. And the husband — he knew the pin number, but he didn’t have the Ledger.” Neither could access the funds without the cooperation of the other. DiMichael, who said he has tracked down millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency since he began tracing digital assets in 2018, explained that when crypto is stored cold, it may be more difficult to seize but it is still traceable. “If they’re doing on-chain transactions and they move something to cold storage, it’s still visible on the blockchain,” he said. DiMichael told CNBC that in a divorce case if you can at least prove that the crypto is there — or that it hasn’t been sold — that’s usually sufficient for a judge. If a spouse bought 100 bitcoins on Coinbase, for example, and later transferred the currency off an exchange to a wallet, it’s still sitting there and fully visible on the blockchain. A court can then order other remedies to retrieve those funds, according to DiMichael. New York divorce attorney Sandra Radna told CNBC that right at the beginning of a case, when she serves the summons and complaint for a divorce, she also asks for a preservation of assets — known as the “automatic orders” in New York. At this point, Radna said, she singles out computer hard drives in her request, to ensure that nothing will be destroyed. This is key since these devices are what the forensic investigator uses to determine where the assets — both crypto and otherwise — went. “They go through the hard drive of the computer to look for ticker symbols within emails, which is how they can see what purchases were made,” Radna said. Radna said she also asks for information such as a spouse’s “public keys,” which she described as being almost like an account number on the blockchain. Currently, much of the world runs on something called asymmetric cryptography, in which individuals use a private and public key pair to access things such as email and crypto wallets. A private key is a secure code that grants the owner access to their crypto holdings — whereas the public key is a unique wallet address. With the public key, it is possible to find a full history of every transaction made into or out of that wallet. “If you have that information, you will be able to see every transaction that they did, and it’s something that the attorneys are able to get as part of discovery because it’s not giving a private number, a private key,” Radna said. Bill Callahan of the Blockchain Intelligence Group said that with that wallet address, crypto hunters are able to tell the attorney or the attorney’s investigator that they should go to a specific exchange to request more information. “One of the things we’re looking for are the on- and off-ramps. We’re looking to see how the money came on to the blockchain, where it may be, and then where it’s off to,” Callahan said. He said the flow of funds can also show whether something was purposely hidden through an obfuscation technique such as using a crypto asset mixer. These so-called mixers are designed to obscure trails of funds by blending someone’s tokens with a pool of other individuals’ assets on the platform. They go beyond traditional crypto platforms in further concealing the identity of the people involved in transactions. “We can kind of track and trace the flow after the proceedings are over to see if something was purposely hidden,” Callahan said. “The blockchain never forgets.” In one case, Himonidis said, he had to track around $2.3 million that was emptied out of a Coinbase account within a few months of divorce proceedings commencing. The crypto coins hadn’t been cashed out to fiat but instead moved as crypto to addresses outside Coinbase in a series of approximately 14 outbound transfers. “All of it wound up in two or three different wallets on a foreign exchange — a place like Coinbase, but in a foreign country that does not operate in the U.S. and is not subject to the laws and jurisdiction in the United States,” Himonidis told CNBC. DiMichael said he has run into similar issues with cases where funds were transferred to a global Binance account, and he was, therefore, unable to subpoena records since the funds were in an untouchable jurisdiction. Tracking assets gets especially complicated when investors begin to move their tokens across blockchains. DiMichael said “chain hopping” — a person switching from one blockchain to another very quickly — is an increasingly common technique used to throw off investigators. Blockchains have their own native tokens. With ethereum, for example, the token is ether. Developers have built cross-chain bridges to let users send tokens from one chain to another. Transfers of digital assets between chains has helped to expand the crypto market by giving people more ways to pay and transact. Cross-chain bridges are vital to the development of the decentralized finance, or DeFi, space, which is crypto’s alternative to the banking system. But in a divorce case these bridges make it difficult for investigators to follow the trail of tokens. Take the crypto token polka dot, which is trading at around $5.40 and has a market valuation of over $6.3 billion. Because the virtual coin is on its own blockchain, when someone wants to trade it they need to “wrap it” in order to buy and sell it on the ethereum blockchain, Himonidis told CNBC. Wrapped tokens are pegged to the value of the original coin but are interoperable with other blockchains. “If we need to start tracing stuff like that, it gets very complicated,” said Himonidis. “When they do coin swaps, now we’re jumping — literally jumping — blockchains, trying to trace the funds. It was complicated enough before, and now, it’s gotten exponentially more complicated in just the last year or two.” Himonidis said he and his firm are able to follow funds across blockchains using a tool previously only available to law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service, and financial institutions that need it for their know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering functions. But even with new search tools, Himonidis described his work as a literal race to try to keep up with the latest in rapidly evolving crypto tech. “It lends itself very well to people who have figured out how it works and understand what’s going on there,” said Himonidis. “It’s this constant arms race.” DiMichael agrees, telling CNBC it was “inevitable” that these kinds of obfuscation techniques would crop up given the amount of money in the crypto ecosystem now, even in the midst of a down market. “But it is still coming as a total shock to the so-called non-monied spouses,” DiMichael said. Many centralized exchanges such as Gemini offer customers the option to stake their tokens in order to earn yield on their digital assets that would otherwise sit idle on the platform. With crypto staking, investors typically vault their crypto assets with a blockchain validator, which verifies the accuracy of transactions on the blockchain. Investors can receive additional crypto tokens as a reward for locking away those assets. In one of his divorce cases, DiMichael said, the husband disclosed the cryptocurrencies he owned, but he didn’t disclose the tokens that were staked. “The ones that he staked, he wasn’t really counting those in his numbers, so I uncovered that through the investigative process,” DiMichael said. “Even though this cryptocurrency wasn’t in his wallet anymore, he still had rights to it.” Even when both parties in a divorce are totally above board on discovery, volatility in the crypto market can prove to be a major issue when attorneys try to value a marital estate. NodeBaron, a 36-year-old vascular surgical engineer and veteran who asked to be identified by his Twitter username, said he liquidated his stake in dogecoin for around $5,000 during his divorce. Six months later, his holdings would have been worth close to $1 million. “The cost to get a divorce was almost like a million-dollar decision,” he said. Divorce attorney Alexandra Mussallem said that because California, where her practice is based, is a community-property state, she often advises her clients on whether to stay in a particular asset — that is, to take half of a community asset in kind versus seeking a liquidated value. “With volatile investments, the right strategy for a spouse trying to build a stable asset base will be to seek a cash buyout at market value on crypto holdings,” said Mussallem, adding that it is a question of managing risk. The spouse with higher risk tolerance may be eager to cash out their partner and retain the crypto asset, given the heavy fluctuations in the crypto market, she said. Burris, the Texas-based attorney, said that in her first crypto case, around five years ago, the husband wanted to buy the wife out of his crypto holdings — which ultimately proved to be a good decision for him, given the rapid price appreciation in the crypto market since 2020. New York is an equitable distribution state, meaning that a spouse gets 50% of the marital assets accumulated during the marriage. Radna, the New York divorce attorney, told CNBC that digital assets can be taken in two ways. “One way is to say, what is the value of that digital asset today, and we divide that up,” she said, calling the process analogous to stocks. “You can either take the shares of stock, or you can take the value of that.” In an up market, Radna said, spouses typically opt for taking the value of the crypto holdings. Valuing and dividing a marital estate can become especially problematic when spouses diversify their crypto portfolio into metaverse properties and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Despite the NFT market collectively losing nearly $2 trillion since its peak in 2021, blue-chip series such as Bored Ape Yacht Club still have a floor price of more than $80,000. “You have digital land as NFTs, you have digital artwork as NFTs, you have digital metaverse clothing in NFTs,” said DiMichael, adding that one of his clients had sold $80 million worth of NFTs. DiMichael, who first spoke with CNBC in 2022, said that if a spouse has a couple of NFTs from a collection like the Bored Ape Yacht Club or Crypto Punks, it could add a couple hundred thousand dollars to the marital estate. “NFTs are really driving me nuts. How do I find the real expert to value the NFT, which is my obligation for a court of law?” said Nutter, the Florida divorce attorney, referring to the Daubert standard, a rule that governs the admissibility of expert witness testimony in court. “It requires more peer reviews, articles, a lot more science and community acceptance, which is challenging when you have something particularly like an NFT.” “NFTs are kind of new, and people know what they are, but to find somebody who has the level of expertise that could satisfy a court Daubert challenge and questioning I think is problematic for pretty much everybody,” she said. “Doesn’t matter what side of the coin you’re on.” Radna, who mostly handles litigated divorces and has been practicing for 30 years, said she specifically looks for digital real estate assets in the metaverse when she requests discovery. “You think it’s not real, but they make real income from it,” said Radna. “They can get paid for someone to rent that digital real estate where they can have advertising and a billboard, but it would be in the metaverse.” If a spouse owns digital real estate and they’re getting rent for it, that would be income and counted in the divorce, according to Radna, who said 20% of her caseload has involved crypto in the last few years. “It’s a whole new world, and people should be aware of it,” she added. Certified financial planner and analyst Davon Barrett told CNBC that with a traditional asset class, he can just give a divorce agreement to Fidelity, for example, and the company will take care of the split on its own. “But with cryptocurrency, it’s a newer space,” said Barrett, the lead advisor at Francis Financial in New York. “It’s harder to get customer service on the phone at times, so splitting it becomes a little bit more difficult.” The tax implications are another major consideration when choosing how to divide crypto assets. The IRS treats cryptocurrencies like property, meaning that each time you spend, exchange or sell your tokens, you’re logging a taxable event. There’s always a difference between how much you paid for your crypto, which is the cost basis, and the market value at the time you spend it. That difference can trigger capital gains taxes. “There are people who bought bitcoin years ago, so their cost basis was $10,000,” Barrett said. He gave a hypothetical where a client would potentially be smarter to keep $500,000 in cash, versus bitcoin, so that their spouse is the one stuck with the gains. “The government, they may not have gotten it in the past, but Uncle Sam is really good about getting his money,” Barrett said. “I think that you have your head in the sand if you don’t think that this is something that’s here to stay, even if during a down market,” Radna said. “Like any other asset, just like the stock market, there’s going to be ups and downs. I think the people that are interested in digital assets are going to continue to be interested in digital assets,” she said. “When it’s a down market, that’s when you go shopping.” "
Founder of a financial planning startup indicted in JPMorgan Chase fraud case,Chloe Atkins,"May 21, 2023, 3:19 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Charlie Javice, an entrepreneur accused of duping JPMorgan Chase into buying her now shutdown college financial aid company Frank, has been indicted on fraud charges. The four-count grand jury indictment filed in Manhattan federal court charged her with securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy. Javice “engaged in a brazen scheme to defraud (JPMorgan Chase) in the course of a $175 million acquisition” of her company, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement last month from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York. In doing so, she “lied directly” to the biggest bank in the United States and “fabricated data to support those lies — all in order to make over $45 million from the sale of her company,"" Williams said. Javice — who appeared on the Forbes 2019 “30 Under 30” list — “falsely and dramatically” inflated the number of Frank customers to “fraudulently induce” the bank to acquire Frank, prosecutors alleged. Javice, 31, founded the college financial aid platform in 2017, and JPMorgan Chase acquired it in 2021. As part of the deal, the bank hired Javice and other Frank employees. Javice received more than $21 million for selling her equity stake in Frank to the bank and an additional $20 million as a retention bonus, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said the founder repeatedly said the company had 4.25 million student customers, when it had fewer than 300,000. Javice asked an “outside data scientist” to fabricate a list of customers when the bank asked for proof of Frank’s user data, according to a criminal complaint filed in the Justice Department case. She paid the data scientist $18,000 for his services, according to a separate complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has also filed fraud charges. Javice initially asked Frank’s director of engineering to generate the fake data, but the engineer was uncomfortable and said, “I don’t want to do anything illegal,"" according to the Justice Department's criminal complaint. Javice, according to the document, said it was legal. Javice said, “We don’t want to end up in orange jumpsuits,” according to the criminal complaint. The financial institution learned of the alleged scam when it sent an email marketing campaign to the list of people Javice said were Frank customers, and it generated only a few responses, according to the SEC complaint. Javice’s attorneys didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. Javice was arrested in April in New Jersey. She was released on a $2 million bond after appearing in a downtown Manhattan federal court. She has not entered a plea in either case. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a January conference call with analysts that the bank’s acquisition of Frank was a “huge mistake,"" Reuters reported. The bank shut down Frank in January. JPMorgan sued Javice in Delaware federal court last year over alleged fraud, accusing her of lying about Frank’s size, success and “depth of Frank’s market penetration” to “cash in,"" according to the lawsuit. Javice has denied the bank’s accusations and said in a counterclaim that it “cannot prove its outlandish claims.” In the counterclaim, Javice said the bank “compromised her reputation” and “wrongfully withheld” nearly $28 million in retention payments and equity.

'Live Laugh Lesbian': Target's cheeky Pride collection strikes again,Matt Lavietes,"May 20, 2023, 3:06 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"As queer Americans face a historic onslaught of anti-LGBTQ legislation, a normalizing of homophobic and transphobic rhetoric from right-wing politicians and a surge of violent attacks, Target’s standout message for Pride Month is simple: “Live Laugh Lesbian.” The short mantra adorns a pink crop top that is part of the global retailer’s latest Pride collection. Other noteworthy items include a coffee mug that says “gender fluid”; rainbow outfits for pets; a Drag Queen Bird Decorative Figurine; a jumpsuit that simply says “GAY” in massive letters; a tote bag with an image of a woman looking off into the distance and text that reads “Busy thinking about girls”; and a graphic T-shirt with an illustration of a skeleton bending its wrist and saying, “Is he … you know?” While many major brands will launch similar Pride-themed products in coming weeks, few are likely to rival Target in generating online chatter leading up to and through the month of June, which is LGBTQ Pride Month. “It’s a sort of universal theme, no matter high-water or low-water, we all have to react to Target and Pride,” said Bob Witeck, president of Witeck Communications, a firm specializing in LGBTQ marketing. Over the past three years, more than 960 TikTok videos — including 100 in the past seven days — have used the hashtag “targetpride,” collecting more than 30 million views for users in the United States, according to analytics from TikTok. Throughout the past three years, search interest for “Target Pride” has surged past comparable searches for the names of direct competitors Amazon and Walmart before and during June, according to Google Trends. The large online reaction to this year’s collection evoked both delight and eye rolls among LGBTQ Americans. “I am torn between thinking the Target Pride collection ‘Live Laugh Lesbian’ shirt is either the best or the worst shirt ever,” drag performer Chiffon Dior wrote on Twitter Thursday. “I don’t think there is a middle ground.” The popular lesbian Instagram account @godimsuchadyke posted a meme featuring the shirt and wrote below the photo, ""This isn't sponsored but it could be @target."" Queer activist Matt Bernstein posted a video on TikTok — which has accrued more than 6.4 million views since it was posted last week — reviewing several of the collection’s products. “Now I know a lot of people aren’t going like this, but I love it,” Bernstein said, referring to the “Live Laugh Lesbian” crop top. “The fact that it says ‘Live Laugh Lesbian’ in the iconic live laugh love font — its irony comes full circle. It’s high camp. I want it on everything.” A representative for Target did not respond to requests for comment. The attention surrounding Target’s Pride collection comes as the broader response to corporate Pride Month efforts has soured in recent years. Critics often accuse corporations’ commitment to the LGBTQ community in June as being phony or shallow, citing seemingly contradictory political donations to conservative lawmakers who are trying to restrict LGBTQ rights. For example, Seattle Pride, a nonprofit group that has organized Seattle’s annual Pride march since 1974, cut ties with Amazon last year, citing the Seattle-based company’s donations to “anti-LGBTQ politicians” and its fundraising efforts on behalf of anti-LGBTQ groups. While most of the country’s major Pride parades are sponsored by some of the world’s largest companies, some activists have recently shunned corporate America’s involvement — and dollars — altogether. A group of LGBTQ organizers in New York City, the Reclaim Pride Coalition, launched an alternative Pride march in 2019 to counter the city’s official parade, which has a long list of corporate sponsors. The newer event, known as the Queer Liberation March, rejects participation from corporations and police. And with more companies launching Pride Month ad campaigns and selling Pride merchandise, there have been some missteps. Last year, for example, food delivery service Postmates and Burger King received backlash for debuting what some thought were overly sexualized Pride campaigns. Target itself has also been accused by some of leaning in to “rainbow capitalism,” a term used to describe the commodification of the LGBTQ community, particularly for its Pride collection in 2021. The brand hired LGBTQ designers for its Pride collection last year, saying that it wanted to “authentically celebrate the community,” according to a company news release. Target continued its partnership with queer designers for its collection this year. Witeck suggests that Target’s Pride collection has become an annual hit — at least in terms of social media chatter — because the brand leans in to what he called a “love-hate” dynamic between corporations and the LGBTQ community with a sense of humor. “They’re things people wouldn’t say, let alone wear,” Witeck said, referring to the collection’s graphic T-shirts. “It gets to the point where it’s so ridiculous that it begs to be worn just to make a joke of it.” Don Caldwell, the editor in chief of Know Your Meme, a website that documents internet phenomena, agreed. “People are kind of suspicious whenever corporations are trying to embrace social justice or activism in a new way,” Caldwell said. “And I think that doing things like a ‘Live, Laugh, Lesbian’ shirt, or something like that, is trying to show support for something but also trying to show a sense of humor about it as well, which I think goes a long way.” Caldwell added, “It could be called ‘cringe’ or what have you, but I think a lot of people find it endearing and kind of cute.” Target’s large selection of playful Pride merchandise comes amid a turbulent time for LGBTQ rights in the nation. More than  480 anti-LGBTQ bills have been filed in state legislatures across the country, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, with lawmakers enacting laws to curtail education on LGBTQ issues in schools, drag performances and access to gender-affirming care, among other provisions. Matt Wagner, vice president of client relations at Target 10, an LGBTQ marketing firm — which is not affiliated with the retailer Target — argued that the mostly positive online response to Target’s Pride collection could be a result of its embrace of the LGBTQ community amid political turmoil. “If I’m in Kansas, or I’m in Louisiana, or I’m in Florida or Alabama, and there’s no LGBTQ center in my city or a gay bar, there’s very little way for you to connect in a physical way to the community. For that person to walk into a Target and see a Pride collection, I would suggest, is very moving,” Wagner said. “The fact that this big American company, that can kind of do whatever it wants, is choosing to embrace the community in that way might sort of have a halo effect on the excitement that people have.” Not all of the attention surrounding Target’s Pride merchandise has been positive. Conservative activists have taken particular issue with the collection’s apparel for children, and a “tuck-friendly” bathing suit for adults. Apparel items for kids contain supportive slogans, including “just be you” and “trans people will always exist!” Matt Walsh, the host of right-wing news outlet Daily Wire’s “The Matt Walsh Show,” urged listeners of his podcast to boycott the brand, accusing Target of “trying to recruit kids into the LGBT camp.” “There are millions and millions and millions of Americans in this country who are disgusted by this, who do not want to, they don’t want to have the rainbow stuff vomited all over them the moment that they walk into a store,” Walsh said. “They especially don’t want that to happen when they’re bringing their kids with them into the store as so many parents do.” Gays Against Groomers, a far-right group describing itself as an “organization of gays against the sexualization, indoctrination and medicalization of children,” said on Twitter that the company “deserves the Bud Light treatment.” Conservative activists began boycotting Anheuser-Busch’s Bud Light beer brand en masse after it launched a social media partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney last month. “We urge you to take your business elsewhere. They are indoctrinating and grooming them with LGBTQ ideology,” the group said of Target in a tweet that was viewed more than 1.3 million times. “It is highly inappropriate and disturbing.” Good or bad, Witeck called the online reactions to Target’s Pride collection “remarkable.” “Even if I’ll never be caught dead buying all of this stuff, I would say that it’s a success because the brand is well known for it,” Witeck said.

Debt ceiling talks back on after GOP negotiators briefly 'press pause',Garrett Haake,"May 19, 2023, 4:30 PM UTC / Updated May 20, 2023, 2:17 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — Republicans returned to the debt ceiling negotiating table Friday night after temporarily pausing talks with the White House that they said were “not productive.” The movement came about seven hours after Rep. Garret Graves, R-La, who was tapped by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to lead the negotiations with White House staff, told reporters “we decided to press pause” because their morning meeting was “just not productive.” Graves declined at the time to comment on details of the negotiations, but said the administration was being “unreasonable” as the clock ticks to the June 1 deadline set by the Treasury Department to act or risk a calamitous default on U.S. debt. After meeting with White House officials on Capitol Hill for about 90 minutes Friday night, Graves told reporters they had ""a candid discussion about realistic numbers, a realistic path forward, and something that truly changes the trajectory of this country’s spending and debt problem.” Asked if the evening’s discussions yielded any progress, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, another GOP negotiator, said, ""No."" He also said they weren't confident they will be able to reach a deal before the end of the month. Steve Ricchetti, one of three White House aides President Joe Biden designated to represent him in talks with McCarthy, told reporters, “We’re going to keep working tonight,” adding they are leaving the building “for the time being.” It was not immediately clear when the two sides would meet again. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, speaking to reporters in Japan, said the administration was “optimistic” about a path forward. But she also acknowledged “serious differences” with Republicans. “This is going to continue to be a difficult conversation,” she said. Part of the hang-up in negotiations is that House Republicans want to force major spending cuts that are opposed by Biden and dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. ""It is very frustrating if they want to come into the room and think we’re going to spend more money next year than the year we did this year. That’s not right. And that’s not going to happen,"" McCarthy said Friday night on Fox Business. Earlier in the day he said there hasn't been enough “movement” from the White House, adding that he had spoken to Graves that day but not to the president, who is attending a Group of Seven summit in Japan. A White House spokesperson said Friday that “a responsible, bipartisan budget agreement remains possible if both sides negotiate in good faith and recognize that neither side will get everything it wants.” “There are real differences between the parties on budget issues and talks will be difficult,” the spokesperson added. “The president’s team is working hard towards a reasonable bipartisan solution that can pass the House and the Senate.” Democrats are reluctant to accept a spending limit that's lower than current levels, a source familiar with the party's stance said. The party may prefer to maintain existing levels, even if it means a new spending deal fails and the government runs on autopilot through a continuing resolution. There is a push, according to a Democratic source familiar with the negotiations, to pass a short-term spending resolution at the same time as a debt limit hike through early 2025. That would give McCarthy what he’s wanted all along: moving those two issues in tandem — while the White House and Democrats, who initially demanded a “clean” debt hike, can save face by claiming the negotiation is about the budget. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,  said earlier this week, ""Avoiding default should not be contingent on passing the GOP’s hard right partisan agenda."" Congress must act in the coming weeks or the U.S. could breach the debt ceiling as soon as June 1, the Treasury Department has warned. A source familiar with the negotiations said hardline conservatives were pleased by Friday's pause in talks with the White House. “The fact they are doing this shows they are still willing to walk away,” the source said, adding there had been concerns that McCarthy's team had not been focusing on their core issue. ""The cuts are what matter,"" the source said. Meanwhile, a GOP aide said conservatives “are privately seething"" at how the talks have been going and that ""Republicans are giving away their leverage.” On Thursday, the conservative Freedom Caucus issued a statement saying the House-passed debt bill represents the formal position of the bloc of roughly 30 hard-right House Republicans. Former President Donald Trump, who's urged Republicans to let the default happen if their demands aren't met, reiterated that call on his social media website Friday. ""REPUBLICANS SHOULD NOT MAKE A DEAL ON THE DEBT CEILING UNLESS THEY GET EVERYTHING THEY WANT (Including the 'kitchen sink'),"" Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, wrote on Truth Social. ""THAT’S THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALWAYS DEALT WITH US. DO NOT FOLD!!!"" "
"Child labor bill passed by Iowa Legislature appears to violate federal law, federal officials say",Laura Strickler,"May 19, 2023, 8:18 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A new law passed by the Iowa Legislature designed to increase youth employment opportunities in a tight labor market appears to violate federal child labor protections, according to U.S. Labor Department officials. The new state law, yet to be signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, allows kids to work in “laundries” and to “perform light assembly work as long as the assembly is not performed on machines or in an area with machines,” which federal officials say is likely prohibited. Reynolds has until June 2 to sign the bill. In a letter to Iowa Democratic lawmakers, Seema Nanda, the Labor Department’s chief lawyer, and Jessica Looman, the principal deputy administrator of the department division that enforces child labor laws, said that if jobs are not specifically allowed by federal regulation then they cannot be performed by 14- and 15-year-olds and can be considered “oppressive child labor.” The bill also allows 14- and 15-year-olds to “perform non-incidental work in meat freezers,” which federal officials say is explicitly forbidden under federal law. Additionally, the legislation lets 14- and 15-year-olds work until 9 p.m. during the school year. In their letter, Nanda and Looman write that allowing this “appears to violate” the federal rule that children can only work until 7 p.m. In a statement, the Gov. Reynolds' spokesperson said, ""Iowa’s new legislation and some of its current laws related to employment of minors differ with aspects of federal employment law. This is also the case with employment laws for 20 other U.S. states, including Illinois and Minnesota."" Under the Biden administration, the Labor Department has been more aggressive in enforcing child labor laws in light of what they say is a 69% increase in violations around the country. Federal officials say they have over 600 open child labor investigations nationwide, including in the state of Iowa. Recent federal investigations by the department revealed egregious examples. In Kentucky, Labor Department investigators found more than 300 children worked more hours than allowed at McDonalds restaurants. According to an agency official, investigators also found that two 10-year-olds worked eight unpaid shifts in August 2022. In a larger query, federal investigators concluded in February that more than 100 minors were paid to clean up blood and animal parts on overnight shifts in Midwestern slaughterhouses. The sanitation company paid a $1.5 million fine. The Iowa legislation is among at least 14 bills introduced this year in legislatures around the country that weaken child labor protections, according to a new analysis by the union-backed Economic Policy Institute. In Iowa, the bill was primarily pushed by business interests that argue they are struggling to find workers in a tight labor market. A coalition made up mostly of organized labor groups opposed the legislation. Megan Fredericksen, of Earlham, told NBC News she wishes her daughter Keira, who is now 16, could have been working at the local coffee shop until 9 p.m. on school nights while she was 14 and 15 years old. “She has limited time that she can work,” she said. “It has been kind of a struggle to get her on the schedule as much as she would like,” she added. Fredericksen said her understanding is that under the new law parents could opt out of their kids working until 9 p.m. “I would not opt out of that,” she said. “My kid is going to be out anyway, they are not going to be sitting at home and if the only thing stopping it is an outdated law — I feel better knowing she is at work than out and about, I have no problem with it.” Nina Easley, who owns the Earlham coffee shop where Fredericksen’s daughter works, calls the bill a “game-changer” for her business. “We close at 8 and I can’t really afford to bring multiple people in. I need a closer and I have kids who want the hours,” Easley said. Easley was featured in a podcast by the Iowa Restaurant Association, which lobbied for the bill, according to the state legislative website. Jennifer Sherer, an Iowa-based labor activist with the Economic Policy Institute, said she’s concerned about a disproportionate impact on low-income children, who she said are more likely to be vulnerable to labor exploitation. She said research shows that when teens work over a certain number of hours, it can push some to drop out of school. “We also know that kids who are in families who are particularly economically desperate are more likely to be motivated to work longer hours and for lower wages,” said Sherer.

Federal Reserve chair hints at a pause in rate hikes when central bank meet next month,The Associated Press,"May 19, 2023, 7:26 PM UTC",Economy,"Chair Jerome Powell indicated Friday that the Federal Reserve will likely forgo an increase in its benchmark interest rate when it meets in June for the first time since it began raising its key rate 14 months ago to fight high inflation. In signaling so, Powell provided some clarity about the Fed’s likely next policy move after a cacophony of speeches this week by central bank officials had clouded the picture. “Having come this far, we can afford to look at the data and the evolving outlook and make careful assessments,” Powell said, referring to the Fed’s 10 straight rate hikes, which have elevated its key short-term rate from near zero a year ago to about 5.1%, its highest level in 16 years. Speaking at a Fed conference in Washington, Powell said the central bank’s benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, is now high enough to restrain borrowing, spending and economic growth. Fed officials hope that slower growth will cool inflation over time. Several Fed officials, in speeches this week, signaled support for suspending the rate increases based on the notion that the rate hikes haven’t yet fully affected the economy and could take months to do so. Under that view, the Fed should take time to assess the consequences of its actions and avoid tightening credit so much as to trigger a recession. On Friday, Powell seemed to endorse that approach, saying, “We face uncertainty about the lagged effects of our tightening so far.” The Fed chair also suggested that “the risks of doing too much versus doing too little are becoming more balanced.” That marks a shift from earlier this year, when Powell often said the risk of raising rates too little to combat inflation outweighed the risk of raising them so high as to cause a deep recession. Powell further noted that turmoil in the banking sector, after three large banks collapsed in the past two months, will likely cause banks to reduce the pace of lending, which could weaken the economy. “As a result, our policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to achieve our goals,” he said. “Of course, the extent of that is highly uncertain.” Comments from Fed officials this week had conveyed decidedly mixed messages about the central bank’s likely next move. Most of the policymakers signaled support for a pause at its next meeting. But several others expressed their belief that the Fed would have to further raise rates to curb persistent inflation. Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said Thursday that inflation remained too high and that the latest economic data didn’t yet justify a pause in hikes. Inflation, under the Fed’s preferred measure, has declined but remains far above the central bank’s 2% annual target. Inflation was 4.2% in March, compared with a year earlier, though it is down from 7% last June. But excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core inflation has slowed much less, from a peak of 5.4% in February 2022 to 4.6% in March. It has barely budged since November. “The data have continued to support the (Fed’s) view that bringing inflation down will take some time,” Powell said. Not all Fed officials share Powell’s concern that the upheaval in banking will harm the economy. Several Fed officials have suggested that the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and two others might have little impact. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and Austan Goolsbee, head of the Chicago Fed, said this week that they haven’t seen lenders in their districts pull back on lending just because of the bank failures. “I don’t know that we have a crisis right now in financial markets,” Bostic said. “We have a small number of institutions that had risk management strategies that work less well than you would like.” Goolsbee, who spoke on a panel with Bostic, said that banks in his region have tightened credit because of the Fed’s rate hikes and not necessarily because of the bank failures. But they haven’t gone further because of the bank failures. "

"Hyundai, Kia agree to $200 million settlement with customers over car thefts",Reuters,"May 19, 2023, 3:13 PM UTC",News,"Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp. agreed to a consumer class-action lawsuit settlement worth $200 million over rampant car thefts of the Korean automakers’ vehicles, lawyers for the owners and the automakers said on Thursday. In February, the Korean automakers said they would offer software upgrades to 8.3 million U.S. vehicles without anti-theft immobilizers to help curb increasing car thefts using a method popularized on TikTok and other social media channels. The settlement covers about 9 million U.S. owners and includes up to $145 million for out-of-pocket losses for consumers who had cars stolen, lawyers for the owners said. Hyundai and Kia said they will compensate owners “who incurred theft-related vehicle losses or damage in addition to reimbursement for insurance deductibles, increased insurance premiums, and other theft related losses.” For customers whose vehicles cannot accommodate security software upgrades, the Korean automakers will provide up to $300 for the purchase of steering wheel locks and other theft deterrent or prevention devices. “The settlement will provide benefits as soon as possible to those who have suffered out-of-pocket losses,” said Steve Berman, a lawyer representing owners. TikTok videos showing how to steal cars without push-button ignitions and immobilizing anti-theft devices has led to at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities in the United States, regulators said in February. The consumer settlement covers owners of 2011 through 2022 model year Hyundai or Kia vehicles with a traditional “insert-and-turn” steel key ignition system. It includes payments for total loss of vehicles up to $6,125, damage to vehicle and personal property up to $3,375 and insurance-related expenses. Other related expenses including car rental, taxi or other transportation costs not covered by insurance are also included by the settlement. Owners can get reimbursed for towing costs and for stolen vehicles that suffered crashes or were never recovered, as well as payments for tickets or other penalties or fines incurred arising from a stolen vehicle. Many major cities have sued the automakers over the thefts including St. Louis, Missouri, Cleveland, Ohio; San Diego, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Columbus, Ohio; Baltimore and Seattle.

JPMorgan seeks files from Manhattan DA in Jeffrey Epstein lawsuits,Chloe Atkins,"May 19, 2023, 2:02 AM UTC / Updated May 19, 2023, 4:23 AM UTC",News,"JPMorgan Chase is seeking documents from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office in lawsuits the bank faces over its relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a former client, according to federal court records. Attorneys for Bragg, JPMorgan Chase; a former senior executive, Jes Staley; and the plaintiffs in the cases attended a telephone conference before U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff on Tuesday. Rakoff instructed Bragg’s office to provide a so-called privilege log relating to documents sought by the Wall Street giant by Friday. That's a list of documents Bragg's office argues are privileged and not subject to discovery. A spokesperson for Bragg said, “A protective order is in place, so we cannot comment on the nature of the requested documents.” The bank faces two lawsuits, filed last year by the U.S. Virgin Islands and a woman identified as “Jane Doe 1,” accusing it of having facilitated Epstein’s sex-trafficking enterprise. “JPMorgan knowingly, negligently, and unlawfully provided and pulled the levers through which recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise,” the U.S. Virgin Islands alleged in its complaint. The two suits seek monetary damages. JPMorgan Chase has denied liability. Deutsche Bank agreed Wednesday to pay $75 million to Epstein victims to settle a lawsuit claiming it enabled Epstein’s conduct. JPMorgan Chase sued Staley in March, claiming he should be held liable for damages it might face from the lawsuits. It accuses Staley — who worked at the bank for more than 30 years — of knowing about Epstein’s conduct and engaging in “sexual activity with young women procured by Epstein.” Staley asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed and said the bank is using him as a “public relations shield.” However, he has expressed regret for his relationship with Epstein. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is scheduled to be deposed in the lawsuits this month. On Thursday evening, a JPMorgan  spokesman told NBC News: “Jamie Dimon never met Epstein, never communicated with him, never emailed with him, and never played a role in any business with him.” In a Bloomberg television interview last week, Dimon said he is “so sad that we had any relationship to that man whatsoever.” “You know, we had top lawyers evaluating, from the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] enforcement, the [Justice Department], you know, and obviously, had we known then what we know today, we would have done things differently,” Dimon said. “But it’s very unfortunate, and I have deep respect for these women. ""That doesn’t mean we’re liable for the action of an individual,"" he added, “but I do have deep respect for them. My heart goes out to them.” In court documents, the U.S. Virgin Islands has alleged that the company's “banking relationship” was known at the “highest levels of the bank.""  An August 2008 internal email says, “I would count Epstein’s assets as a probable outflow for ’08 ($120mm or so?) as I can’t imagine it will stay (pending Dimon review).” Additional internal emails and memos filed as exhibits also revealed that bank executives had been worried about the financial institution’s relationship with Epstein dating to 2006. Financial records showed Epstein used his JPMorgan Chase accounts to transfer around $3 million to “women and girls” from 2003 to 2013, according to records the plaintiffs filed as exhibits. The financial records do not disclose the names of those who received the transfers or their connections to Epstein. During that time, Epstein withdrew a little over $5 million in cash, typically in amounts of $40,000, court documents show. Meanwhile, Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., a member of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, asked Dimon in a letter last week why the bank ignored “obvious signs of Epstein’s illegal activity” and maintained a relationship with Epstein. “If true, JPMorgan’s decision to turn a blind eye to such egregious misconduct raises serious questions about its role in facilitating Epstein’s abuse, and its willingness or ability to root out and prevent other, less apparent instances of sex trafficking,” she said.

"Couples 55 and older will be able to contribute more than $10,000 to health savings accounts",Rob Wile,"May 18, 2023, 7:32 PM UTC",Business News,"Older U.S. couples will be able contribute more than $10,000 annually toward tax-free health savings accounts. Under guidance the IRS announced Tuesday that goes into effect next year, individuals can contribute as much as $4,150 to an HSA each year, a 7.8% increase. Families can set aside up to $8,300, up 7.1%, according to the new rules. The amount individuals and couples who are 55 and older and not yet on Medicare can contribute to an HSA will climb to $5,150 and $10,300, respectively. That includes the $1,000 catch-up contribution they are already allowed to set aside in an HSA each year. The large annual cost-of-living adjustment was expected given rising inflation, according to Kevin Robertson, senior vice president and chief revenue officer at HSA Bank. But he said the ability of older couples to contribute more than $10,000 and older individuals more than $5,000 helps establish an important psychological precedent. ""It just sounds like a lot of money,"" he said. ""It will catch people's attention, and more will say they now need to look at an HSA contribution."" HSAs are touted as a way to grow and set aside money for medical expenses tax-free. As the Society for Human Resource Management observed: ""Contributions are made pretax, the money in the accounts grows tax free and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax free."" The average HSA created in 2005 has now accumulated more than $50,000 in investments and deposits, according to data from Devenir, an independent investment adviser and consultant in the HSA industry. That's already about one-sixth of the approximately $315,000 that Fidelity's Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate calculates will be cumulatively spent by retirees on medical expenses. ""The vast majority of people are not maxing out their contributions each year,"" Robertson said. The new contribution limits ""will allow people to think about their needs ... and get people more engaged."" "
Disney scraps plan for new Florida campus amid DeSantis feud,"Sarah Whitten, CNBC","May 18, 2023, 6:46 PM UTC",Corporations,"Disney has abandoned plans to open up a new employee campus in Lake Nona, Florida, amid rising tensions with the state’s governor. Citing “changing business conditions” and the return of CEO Bob Iger, Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney’s parks, experiences and products division, penned a memo to employees Thursday, announcing that the company will not move forward with construction of the campus and will no longer be asking more than 2,000 California-based employees to relocate to Florida. “This was not an easy decision to make, but I believe it is the right one,” D’Amaro told employees. Many Disney employees balked at the company’s relocation plans when they were first announced in July 2021 by former CEO Bob Chapek. While some left the company, or transitioned to other posts within Disney that would not require a move to Florida, others held out hope that the plan would fizzle out after a postponement. The campus was originally slated to open in 2022-2023, but was later delayed to 2026. Disney is headquartered in Burbank, California, but operates a number of satellite offices across the country and the world. D’Amaro said employees who have already moved to Florida may be able to relocate back to California. “It is clear to me that the power of this brand comes from our incredible people, and we are committed to handling this change with care and compassion,” he said. Disney’s announcement comes amid a bitter feud between the company and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The company filed a lawsuit accusing DeSantis and the new board members of its special district of carrying out a campaign of political retribution against the entertainment giant. DeSantis targeted Disney’s special district, formerly called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, after the company publicly criticized a controversial Florida bill — dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by critics — that limits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms. The special district has allowed the entertainment giant to effectively self-govern its Orlando parks’ operations for decades. The district was ultimately left intact, but its five-member board was replaced with DeSantis picks and renamed the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District. Disney filed its suit in late April after the new board voted to undo development contracts that the company said it struck to secure its investments. The company has since updated that lawsuit to include newly passed legislation targeting its monorail system as further evidence of retaliation by the governor. Iger has publicly lambasted DeSantis and the Florida government, noting that Disney has created thousands of indirect jobs, brings around 50 million visitors to Florida every year and is the state’s largest taxpayer. D’Amaro reiterated in his memo that the company still plans to invest $17 billion in Florida over the next 10 years, including the addition of around 13,000 jobs. The company currently employs more than 75,000 people in the state. Disney declined to provide specific updates on that investment, but has previously announced plans to update park attractions, expand existing parks and add more cruise ships to its fleet in Florida. “I remain optimistic about the direction of our Walt Disney World business,” D’Amaro told employees.

Rep. Graves is negotiating the debt ceiling and keeping the fractured GOP united,Scott Wong,"May 18, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — He was never elected to House leadership. He’s not a committee chairman, nor does he sit on the key committees that oversee the U.S. budget. But Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., has been tapped by Speaker Kevin McCarthy for one of the most important tasks facing House Republicans: cutting a deal with President Joe Biden this month to avert a potentially disastrous debt default. Colleagues say Graves, who started his career as a longtime House and Senate staffer, is a policy wonk and Capitol Hill insider who understands the institution and how bipartisan deals get made. And they describe him as an “honest broker” who has the trust of not only McCarthy, R-Calif., but also the various factions of the GOP Conference, known as the “Five Families.” McCarthy has leaned on Graves from the very start of his speakership in January, and he gave him a spot in House leadership that did not require election by his fellow Republicans. And in March, McCarthy deputized Graves to broker a peace between hard-right and moderate Republicans and craft a package that would lift the debt ceiling while cutting spending and repealing parts of Biden’s agenda. At the time, McCarthy’s decision prompted some head-scratching — even mockery — within the House GOP. “What other speaker in history has outsourced debt ceiling negotiations to a random rank and file?” a senior Republican aide quipped. But on April 26 the House passed the Limit, Save, Grow Act on a party-line basis — and by a single vote — allowing Republicans to lay down their marker in the standoff with Biden. Since then, McCarthy has tasked Graves with leading negotiations for House Republicans alongside congressional aides and senior White House officials. McCarthy praised Graves when he was asked about his role Wednesday. “He’s worked with all the different groups, and he’s really been the individual that helped bring people together in crafting the bill itself of Limit, Save, Grow. So he has a clear understanding of where members are,” McCarthy said. “He is a former staffer. He’s a former member working in government,” McCarthy continued. “He understands policy — many people would call him a policy wonk.” Reporters have seen Graves produce sheet after sheet of printouts of data, bill text and budget projections from his jacket pocket, like a magician producing scarves, to support talking points during policy discussions. And at a news briefing in his office last week, he gave clues about where the negotiations were heading, spelling out four policy areas where Republicans and the White House could strike a deal. On Wednesday, Graves was spotted shuttling between the bipartisan negotiations and the speaker’s office as McCarthy spoke nearby at the unveiling of former Speaker Paul Ryan's portrait. Graves declined to comment about the ongoing talks. Asked whether Graves is empowered to make decisions on his behalf, McCarthy said: “Yeah. We talk very frequently. I go in the room, as well. So I think — if the administration can make decisions with the president not there, we’ll be OK.” The naming of top negotiators by Biden and McCarthy this week represents a new, more serious phase of debt ceiling talks as the clock ticks closer to the June 1 deadline, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the U.S. could run out of money to pay its bills. At Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting with congressional leaders, Biden tapped three top White House aides to negotiate on his behalf: budget director Shalanda Young, adviser Steve Ricchetti and chief legislative liaison Louisa Terrell. McCarthy picked Graves and his outgoing chief of staff, Dan Meyer. Young also hails from Graves’ district in southern Louisiana, and the two have a rapport they developed during previous discussions over hurricane protection coastal restoration and flood control issues in the state. “Garret is uniquely qualified, because he has the confidence of the various factions within the conference. He’s an honest broker, and he certainly has the trust of Speaker McCarthy,” said Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., who, like Graves, is a member of the Republican Study Committee, or RSC, the largest bloc of conservatives on Capitol Hill. “When you’re dealing with any of these groups — whether it’s Main Street [Caucus], Tuesday Group, Freedom Caucus, RSC — the big thing is: Are you going to be a person of your word, are you going to be a man of your word? And Garret has done that consistently,” Cammack said. Centrist Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said: “Garret is … trustworthy, levelheaded and a good listener. If he has enemies, I don’t know who they are.” Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., a McCarthy skeptic and a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, said he has ""no reason not to trust Congressman Graves."" ""He’s been a key resource, ally, lieutenant for Speaker McCarthy over the last six months,” Good said in an interview Wednesday night. “And I think he’s been helpful in getting the conference together on the legislation that we passed and bringing disparate viewpoints to come together towards our shared objectives and common goals."" Since his election to Congress in 2014, Graves has kept a relatively low profile on the Hill. Rather than try to build a national brand, he put his head down, immersed himself in committee work on the Natural Resources and the Transportation and Infrastructure committees and focused on policy issues, specifically energy, which is the lifeblood of Louisiana. Energy policy has become central to the debt talks as Republicans demand that permitting reform be part of any bipartisan deal. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., whom Graves succeeded in the House, called him ""talented"" and a ""good guy"" who has ""obviously gotten into the good graces"" of McCarthy. Cassidy expressed some disappointment that Graves voted no on the major infrastructure package he negotiated in 2021 but said they mostly work well together on issues like flood insurance and disaster relief. ""Obviously our interests diverged a little. He voted against the infrastructure bill, and I voted for it, so there's not always a complete sync there,"" Cassidy said in an interview. ""And, of course, the infrastructure bill is incredible for my state. ... But as a rule, we pretty much see eye to eye."" In 2019, McCarthy named Graves as the top Republican on the  House Climate Crisis Committee, a Democratic effort that did not get much attention. And before this year, Graves had been overshadowed by two other powerful Louisiana House Republicans: Majority Leader Steve Scalise and GOP Conference Vice Chair Mike Johnson, both former chairmen of the Republican Study Committee. But even before Graves became a member of Congress, he had acquired a deep knowledge of both ends of the Capitol. He was an aide to then-Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., both in his personal office and when Tauzin was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. He also worked as an aide at the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “I think he understands the inner workings of the House. He has a good pulse on our conference and the political dynamics,” said Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., another colleague on the Republican Study Committee. “He is a former staffer at the Energy and Commerce Committee and has immense knowledge from his experience as a staffer and his leadership on energy issues, his leadership on transportation issues."" A Democrat who has worked alongside Graves on the Transportation and Infrastructure panel called him a serious legislator who is not interested in scoring political points in the media. ""He takes legislating seriously and is willing to listen to the argument if he doesn't agree initially. His views are conservative, but he knows we have to move forward,"" said Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington, the top Democrat on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. ""He is a serious negotiator and definitely not interested in the sound bite."" "
Deutsche Bank agrees to pay $75 million to Jeffrey Epstein victims to settle lawsuit,"Eamon Javers, CNBC","May 18, 2023, 8:16 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million to victims of sex predator Jeffrey Epstein to settle a federal lawsuit accusing the bank of enabling and benefitting from its customer’s sex trafficking of young women, sources told CNBC on Wednesday night. The bombshell deal still leaves JPMorgan Chase to defend its own would-be class action lawsuit by Epstein accusers in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, which involves similar allegations. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has said the bank is not liable for sex trafficking by its former long-time customer Epstein, is due to be deposed in that suit, and a related one by the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands on May 26. The settlement agreement by Deutsche Bank, which will set aside $75 million for Epstein accusers, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Under the deal, victims of Epstein who were affected by his sex trafficking during the time when he was a customer of Deutsche Bank, from 2013 through 2018, would receive at least $75,000 and up to $5 million depending on an evaluation of their claims. Deutsche Bank spokesman Dylan Riddle would not comment on the deal, but noted that his bank has spent more than 4 billion euros [$4.34 billion] to strengthen internal financial controls. “In recent years Deutsche Bank has made considerable progress in remedying a number of past issues,” Riddle said. He noted that in 2020, when the bank agreed to pay a $150 million fine to New York’s financial regulator for its dealings with Epstein and other issues, Deutsche Bank had said, “We acknowledge our error onboarding Epstein in 2013, and the weaknesses in our processes, and have learnt from our mistakes and our shortcomings.” The two law firms representing the accusers, Edwards Pottinger and Boies Schiller Flexner, in a joint statement obtained by CNBC said: “This groundbreaking settlement is the culmination of two law firms conducting more than a decade-long investigation to hold one of Epstein’s financial banking partners responsible for the role it played in facilitating his trafficking organization.” The suit, which was seeking class-action status, was filed in November by a woman using the pseudonym Jane Doe. She alleged Deutsche Bank knowingly participated in and financially benefited from participating in Epstein’s sex trafficking “by providing the requisite financial support for the continued operation” of that scheme. “Deutsche Bank also knew that Epstein would use means of force, threats of force, fraud, abuse of legal process, exploitation of power disparity, and a variety of other forms of coercion to cause young women and girls to engage in commercial sex acts,” the suit says. “Knowing that they would earn millions of dollars from facilitating Epstein’s sex trafficking, and from its relationship with Epstein, Deutsche Bank chose profit over following the law,” the suit said. “Specifically, Deutsche Bank chose facilitating a sex trafficking operation in order to churn profits.” Epstein, who had been a customer of JPMorgan from 1998 through 2013, became a customer of Deutsche Bank after JPMorgan ended its banking relationship with him. “Deutsche Bank picked up exactly where JPMorgan left off and became the bank that Epstein needed to fund his sexual abuse and sex-trafficking operation,” the suit says. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019, a month after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges. His arrest in that case came 10 years after he served a jail sentence or more than a year for pleading guilty in Florida state court to soliciting sex for money from an underage girl. That 2008 guilty plea was widely publicized. "
SAG-AFTRA calls for strike authorization vote ahead of studio talks,Variety,"May 18, 2023, 3:32 AM UTC",Pop Culture News,"SAG-AFTRA announced Wednesday that it will hold a strike authorization vote as it seeks to get its “ducks in a row” ahead of June 7 negotiations with the major studios. The vote does not mean that the performers union will necessarily join the Writers Guild of America on the picket lines after its contract expires on June 30. In a press release, the union said its negotiating committee decided that a strike authorization would provide “maximum bargaining leverage” for the talks. “We must get all our ducks in a row should the need present itself,” SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in the release. “The prospect of a strike is not a first option, but a last resort. As my dad always says, ‘Better to have and not need than to need and not have!’” The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, declined to comment. In 2017, the performers’ union threatened to call a strike authorization vote as talks got close to the deadline. At the time, the union said the AMPTP was seeking “outrageous rollbacks.” The two sides ultimately reached a deal without the guild’s having to call the vote. SAG-AFTRA also obtained a strike authorization during negotiations over the 2018 TV animation contract. In that case, more than 98% of the voting members approved the authorization, and the parties reached a deal two months later. This time around, there will be only three weeks between the beginning of negotiations and the June 30 contract expiration. Taking a strike authorization vote now may be a way to gain leverage without having to lose time at the bargaining table. Drescher has appeared on the WGA picket lines, and she has expressed her support for the writers’ strike, which began May 2. But she stirred controversy among some of her membership last week when she suggested, to Deadline, that SAG-AFTRA and the WGA have different issues. “I don’t think what’s very important to writers — and I’m a writer too in the WGA — is the kind of stuff that we’re going after,” Drescher said. “Although I’m very empathic for their needs to be honored, I feel like our conversation is going to be very different. And I feel very hopeful that maybe we won’t get to this point.” SAG-AFTRA is looking at some of the issues that have been important to writers, including wage increases to address inflation, a higher streaming residual and protections against artificial intelligence. The union is also looking to address the move to “self-tape” auditions, which many performers find costly and burdensome. In the release, the guild said that given the array of issues, “the outlook for working actors becomes unsustainable without transformative change.” SAG-AFTRA represents 160,000 performers. "
Montana becomes first state to ban TikTok after governor signs bill into law,Doha Madani,"May 17, 2023, 10:16 PM UTC / Updated May 17, 2023, 10:36 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Montana officially became the first state to ban TikTok on Wednesday after Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a bill restricting downloads of the immensely popular social media app into law. The legislation, which was passed last month, makes it illegal for app stores to give users the option to download TikTok and illegal for the company to operate within the state. The law is likely to face challenges in court arguing it restricts free speech, but Gianforte praised its privacy protections. “The Chinese Communist Party using TikTok to spy on Americans, violate their privacy, and collect their personal, private, and sensitive information is well-documented,” Gianforte said in a news release, calling the law ""the most decisive action of any state."" TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter called the bill ""unlawful"" in a statement Wednesday, saying the app is a platform that ""empowers hundreds of thousands of people across the state."" ""We want to reassure Montanans that they can continue using TikTok to express themselves, earn a living, and find community as we continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana,"" Oberwetter said. When the bill passed last month, Oberwetter said its ""champions have admitted that they have no feasible plan for operationalizing this attempt to censor American voices."" Violations of a ban include every time a user is offered the ability to download the app. Each violation could carry a $10,000 penalty. Enforcement would be handled by the Montana Justice Department. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew told Congress in March that 150 million people in the U.S. are regular users of the app, which has exploded in popularity in recent years. Although Montana is the first state to ban downloads and usage of the app for everyone within its borders, limited bans have been issued federally and state by state for government-owned devices, as well as networks. President Joe Biden signed a ban last year that prohibits the federal government’s nearly 4 million employees to use TikTok on devices owned by its agencies. "
Hundreds of U2 fans didn't know the seats they were buying for Las Vegas residency had limited views,Rob Wile,"May 17, 2023, 9:54 PM UTC",Business News,"Hundreds of people who bought tickets for U2's Las Vegas residency are being offered refunds after learning their seats had obstructed views of the event venue's screen. Show organizers realized during a production review that an overhang in the new, $2 billion Sphere at The Venetian Resort's first level would limit the view of the concert’s screen for some attendees. A source familiar with the issue said it affected about 4% of the venue’s approximately 17,500 seats. In addition to refunds, affected customers are also being offered access to a presale for December seats with full views of the band, the stage and the screen. ""As soon as we realized there was an issue, we worked closely with Event Organizers to reach the affected ticketholders with several make good options,"" a spokesperson for Sphere Entertainment Co., which owns Sphere, said in a statement. ""We look forward to Sphere’s opening with U2 and their incredible run of shows they have planned for fans this Fall.” One fan, Piotr Hryszkiewicz, said he paid $501.35 per ticket to see the band only to learn he would be seated in the obstructed area. In an email, Hryszkiewicz said he opted for a refund and called the situation ""a s--- show."" ""I get it, new venue, still being build etc., but seriously...there should be enough competent people to ensure it runs smoothly,"" he wrote. According to Sphere's website, tickets for U2's residency started at $140, reflecting all-in pricing, with remaining tickets now starting at $550. The band's residency, the first musical performance to take place at Sphere, has been years in the making. Construction on the venue has been underway for five years. According to Rolling Stone, U2 first heard about Sphere “a little over two years ago” and the band had been top-of-mind to inaugurate the venue. Unlike many traditional arenas, the dome-shaped Sphere is specially designed for music acts. “It’s just an amazing playpen for us,” U2 guitarist The Edge told Rolling Stone. "
Starbucks India ad starring trans model goes viral with mixed reactions,Sakshi Venkatraman,"May 17, 2023, 9:20 PM UTC",Asian America,"A new Starbucks India campaign featuring a trans model has caused a stir among social media users worldwide. The two-minute ad, titled “#ItStartsWithYourName,” depicts a Hindi-speaking family meeting at a Starbucks to reconcile a father’s strained relationship with his trans daughter. After brief tension, the man shows his acceptance of his daughter by ordering coffees for everyone under her new name, “Arpita.” “For me, you are still my kid,” the dad says in the ad, translated to English in subtitles. “Only a letter has been added to your name.” The ad has been viewed online millions of times since its release last week, and reactions have run the gamut from praise to staunch opposition. Many South Asians said the depiction hits close to home and is an important step forward for young Indians in the LGBTQ community. “I cannot imagine being estranged from my children for any reason let alone for them being who they are, but I know not everyone is there yet,” one person tweeted. “This advert for Starbucks from India, still an incredibly conservative country, sends a powerful statement.” But some in the U.S. and India lambasted Starbucks for going “woke,” even calling for a boycott of the company. “Starbucks facing a backlash in India after going full Bud Light,” an Australia-based news podcast host tweeted, referring to the beer brand that recently collaborated with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney. “If saturating the market with a mediocre US coffee brand wasn’t bad enough, now they are bringing their woke corporate culture to the Sub-Continent.” A spokesperson for Starbucks said that despite the backlash, the company will continue to support the trans community. “At Starbucks, we unequivocally support the LGBTQIA2+ community,” the representative said. “Our campaign in India, #ItStartsWithYourName, shows how Tata Starbucks is committed to making people of all backgrounds and identities feel welcome. ... We will continue to use our voice to advocate for greater understanding on the importance of inclusion and diversity across the communities we serve around the world.” "
Target wrestles with pullback in spending and theft that may cost it more than $1B this year,The Associated Press,"May 17, 2023, 8:50 PM UTC",Corporations,"Target on Wednesday reported another quarterly profit decline and issued a cautious sales and profit outlook for the current period. The Minneapolis company is dealing with rising costs, which includes rising theft as a big factor, and consumers who have become more cautious about spending. The company still topped Wall Street expectations and stuck to annual profit guidance above industry analyst projections. Target is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly results, and a lot of attention will be paid to the impact that stubbornly high inflation and tightening credit are having on customers. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, reports earnings Thursday. Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom post quarterly results later this month. Home Depot, the nation’s largest home improvement retailer, said Tuesday that sales for the first quarter fell 4.2%, and it expects its first annual revenue decline since 2009. Also on Tuesday, U.S. data showed that Americans picked up their spending modestly last month, buoyed by a solid job market and a retreat in prices for some things. But it also revealed how Americans are barely keeping up with inflation. First-quarter net income slipped nearly 6% to $950 million, or $2.05 per share, for the three-month period ended April 29. That compares with $1.01 billion, or $2.16 per share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 0.6% to $25.32 billion in the quarter, up from $25.17 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts expected earnings of $1.77 per share on $25.26 billion in sales in the latest period, according to FactSet. It’s the fifth-consecutive quarter that the retailer’s profit has slipped, although it was much smaller this time. Target reported a 43% drop in profits for the fourth quarter, a 52% drop in third-quarter profits, 90% in the second quarter and a 52% decline in last year’s first quarter. Target earnings per share to be in a range from $1.30 to $1.70 in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting $1.95 per share, according to FactSet. For the full year, the company is maintaining its prior guidance of $7.75 per share to $8.75 per share. Analysts are expecting $8.36 per share, according to FactSet.Target said theft is cutting into its bottom line and it expects related losses could be $500 million more than last year, when losses from theft were estimated to be anywhere from $700 million to $800 million. So that means losses could top $1.2 billion this year. The company said it’s seeing an increasing number of violent incidents at stores as well, but does not want to close stores and is expanding security and locking up some items. Retailers are being hit with a rash of thefts and in some case, closing stores and pulling out of locations because of massive losses, some tied to criminal gangs. The issue has received more notice in the past few years as high-profile smash-and-grab retail thefts and flash mob robberies have garnered national attention. First-quarter comparable sales — or those from stores or digital channels operating for the past 12 months — were flat compared with the year-ago period. That’s bit of a slowdown from the 0.7% growth in the previous quarter. Customer traffic was up. Shoppers are focused on buying necessities like groceries over non-essentials, but they still rely on Target for affordable, trendy fashions. Comparable stores sales grew 0.7% but comparable online sales declined. “We came into 2023 clear-eyed about what consumers were facing with persistent inflation and rising interest rates,” CEO Brian Cornell said during a media call Tuesday. Given this competitive environment, Target is continuing to make investments in stores and online. The discounter said in early March that it plans to invest as much as $5 billion this year expanding services for customers, including a drive-up service for returns, renovations at 175 stores and improvements in online shopping.

Some Senate Democrats urge Biden to prepare to invoke the 14th Amendment to tackle the debt limit,Ali Vitali,"May 17, 2023, 6:36 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — Some Senate Democrats are circulating a letter urging President Joe Biden to prepare to invoke the 14th Amendment to lift the debt ceiling and avert default on his own, without an act of Congress. The emerging letter, which is still in the works, is a sign of growing progressive dissatisfaction with some aspects of the legislative negotiations, like Republican demands to impose tougher work requirements to receive federal benefits. The letter is being led by Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. ""We write to urgently request that you prepare to exercise your authority under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which clearly states: 'the validity of the public debt of the United States...shall not be questioned,'"" the senators write in the draft letter, obtained by NBC News. ""Using this authority would allow the United States to continue to pay its bills on-time, without delay, preventing a global economic catastrophe."" ""While we cannot default on our debt, we also cannot allow the destructive Republican budget to be implemented,"" they continue. The draft letter, which is still being circulated for signatures, comes 15 days before the June 1 deadline set by the Treasury Department for Congress to act or risk breaching the debt limit. Sanders said in an interview Wednesday, “The message is, in a time of massive income and wealth inequality,"" Congress cannot ""balance the budget on the backs of children and the elderly and working families and force kids to go hungry."" ""I mean that is insane. Unacceptable. There is an option out there — it’s the 14th Amendment, it was put into the Constitution for good reason,"" he said. ""The president should implement it.” Merkley said it’s “important” for Biden to be in a position to reject House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s demands, which he said amount to an “attack on ordinary working families” and would “unleash fossil fuels on America.” “I want the president to see that he has the support in the Senate to use the 14th Amendment or other executive powers, including the platinum coin — that he has support to say no to outrageous demands from the radical right that’s trying to terrorize American families,” he said Wednesday. On Tuesday, Biden met with McCarthy, R-Calif., and other congressional leaders, who later offered signs of hope about the negotiations. But the speaker maintained they are still ""far apart."" In the letter, which was first reported by The Washington Post, the Democrats say the GOP's unwillingness to raise taxes on the wealthy and large corporations makes it ""seemingly impossible to enact a bipartisan budget deal at this time."" McCarthy flatly ruled out the idea of tax increases on top earners at a news conference Wednesday. Some experts believe the debt ceiling statute is unconstitutional and cannot prohibit the U.S. from borrowing to pay its debts. But the Biden administration and its predecessors have been reluctant to invoke the 14th Amendment. Then-President Barack Obama's administration looked into it, but his Justice Department never made its opinion on the matter public. Some officials worried that if such a move were to be challenged in court, it could undermine the full faith and credit of the U.S. Biden said recently he has been “considering” the 14th Amendment but concluded that it would not solve the current stalemate, given that “it would have to be litigated.” But the White House Office of Legal Counsel continues to study the matter, according to a source familiar with the talks, for possible future unilateral use. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., voiced skepticism Sunday on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" when asked if Biden should use the 14th Amendment to continue paying the bills. ""I don't want to give Joe Biden advice, but I think we should do our job,"" he said. ""I think that's a precedent to just absolve Congress from being adults."" "
"In nod to urgency, aides for Biden and McCarthy hold late-night debt ceiling talks",Garrett Haake,"May 17, 2023, 1:37 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"A team of White House negotiators met with aides to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the Capitol on Tuesday night in an effort to hammer out a deal to raise the debt ceiling ahead of a potential default, two sources familiar with the discussion said. Earlier in the day, the White House had designated a team of aides to represent President Joe Biden in the talks. Louisa Terrell, the director of the Office of Legislative Affairs; Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget; and Steve Ricchetti, a close adviser to the president, will negotiate with House GOP aides and Rep. Garret Graves, R-La. The new phase in negotiations builds on “direct and productive” discussions in the previous week, a White House official said. At a meeting Tuesday afternoon, White House and congressional leaders recognized that a finished budget would need to pass Congress with bipartisan support in order to make it to Biden’s desk, the official added. As they left the meeting, congressional leaders hinted at some progress. McCarthy, R-Calif., said that the sides remain “far apart” but that “it is possible to get a deal by the end of the week.” The White House announced Tuesday that Biden would cut his trip to Asia short, skipping a visit to Australia and Papua New Guinea and returning to the U.S. on Sunday. He is set to attend a summit of the Group of Seven major industrial countries in Japan but wants to speak with congressional leaders by phone later this week, the White House official said. His top aides will be in regular contact with him while he is in Japan, the official added. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the U.S. could breach its debt ceiling as early as June 1. Failing to reach an agreement to lift the borrowing limit could prove catastrophic for the U.S. and global economies. Staff members have identified some potential areas of agreement, including an overhaul of permitting for energy and infrastructure projects and the possibility of negotiating spending cuts while simultaneously working to raise the debt ceiling. But the talks have been snarled by disagreements over whether to toughen work requirements for federal aid programs. The debt ceiling bill House Republicans passed last month would expand work requirements for some federal aid programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a program that provides grocery aid. McCarthy has said a deal needs to include tougher work requirements, which he said was a red line for him. The House bill was negotiated within the GOP caucus and narrowly passed along party lines. Several Democrats have said the idea is a nonstarter. Biden showed a tentative openness to some new work requirements, but the White House now says he is ""fighting"" to make sure they won't be in the final deal. “The policies House Republicans are proposing would take away Americans’ health care and increase poverty,"" White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa said in a statement.  ""Republicans couldn’t pass them into law when they had unified control of government — and the President is fighting to ensure they will not be in a bipartisan budget agreement.” On Wednesday, House Democrats are beginning an emergency effort to force a vote to increase the debt ceiling with a “discharge petition” that Budget Committee ranking member Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., will file, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wrote in a letter to colleagues. Jeffries urged his Democratic colleagues to add their names to the discharge petition once it is filed. For the petition to succeed, 218 representatives would need to sign on, meaning at least five Republicans would have to join all Democrats in supporting the measure. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., the chair of the Rules Committee, called the discharge petition a ""Hail Mary"" that “will not succeed,"" as any Republican supporters would risk losing their primaries over the move. “The people they’re trying to get are the people that are McCarthy’s most loyal supporters, who’ve hung with him through all of these fights — all 15 ballots,"" Cole said. ""Before you win a general election you've got to win your primary,"" he added. ""You can’t be one of five or six that handed victory to Joe Biden and think you’re gonna go home and be greeted as a savior at any Republican meeting you go to."" "
Elizabeth Holmes loses bid to avoid prison and is ordered to pay $452M in restitution,The Associated Press,"May 17, 2023, 1:33 PM UTC",U.S. news,"SAN FRANCISCO — Disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes appears to be soon bound for prison after an appeals court Tuesday rejected her bid to remain free while she tries to overturn her conviction in a blood-testing hoax that brought her fleeting fame and fortune. In another ruling issued late Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila ordered Holmes to pay $452 million in restitution to the victims of her crimes. Holmes is being held jointly liable for that amount with her former lover and top Theranos lieutenant, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who is already in prison after being convicted on a broader range of felonies in a separate trial. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision on Holmes’ attempt to avoid prison comes nearly three weeks after she deployed a last-minute legal maneuver to delay the start of her 11-year sentence. She had been previously ordered to surrender to authorities on April 27 by Davila, who sentenced her in November. Davila will now set a new date for Holmes, 39, to leave her current home in the San Diego area and report to prison. The punishment will separate Holmes from her current partner, William “Billy” Evans, their 1-year-old son, William, and 3-month-old daughter, Invicta. Holmes’ pregnancy with Invicta — Latin for “invincible,” or “undefeated” — began after a jury convicted her on four counts of fraud and conspiracy in January 2022. Davila has recommended that Holmes serve her sentence at a women’s prison in Bryan, Texas. It hasn’t been disclosed whether the federal Bureau of Prisons accepted Davila’s recommendation or assigned Holmes to another facility. Balwani, 57, began a nearly 13-year prison sentence in April after being convicted on 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy last July. He was incarcerated in a Southern California prison last month after losing a similar effort to remain free on bail while appealing his conviction. The verdict against Holmes came after a 46 days of trial testimony and other evidence that cast a spotlight on a culture of greed and hubris that infected Silicon Valley as technology became a more pervasive influence on society and the economy during the past 20 years. The trial’s most riveting moments unfolded when Holmes took the witness stand to testify in her own defense. Besides telling how she founded Theranos as a teenager after dropping out of Stanford University in 2003, Holmes accused Balwani of abusing her emotionally and sexually. She also asserted she never stopped believing Theranos would revolutionize healthcare with a technology that she promised would be able to scan for hundreds of diseases and other potential problems with just a few drops of blood. While pursuing that audacious ambition, Holmes raised nearly $1 billion from a list of well-heeled investors that included Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Those sophisticated investors all lost their money after a Wall Street Journal investigation and regulatory reviews exposed dangerous flaws in Theranos’ technology. In his restitution ruling, Davila determined that Holmes and Balwani should pay Murdoch $125 million — by far the most among the investors listed in his order. The restitution also requires the co-conspirators in the Theranos scam to pay $40 million in Walgreens, which became an investor in the startup after agreeing to provide some of the flawed blood tests in its pharmacies in 2013. Another $14.5 million is owed to Safeway, which has also agreed to be a Theranos business partner before backing out. In separate hearings, lawyers for Holmes and Balwani tried to persuade Davila their respective clients should be required to pay little, if anything. Prosecutors had been pushing for a restitution penalty in the $800 million range. Both Holmes — whose stake in Theranos was once valued at $4.5 billion — and Balwani — whose holdings were once valued around $500 million — have indicated they are nearly broke after running up millions of dollar in legal bills while proclaiming their innocence. Holmes’s lawyers have been fighting her conviction on grounds of alleged mistakes and misconduct that occurred during her trial. They have also contended errors and abuses that biased the jury were so egregious that she should be allowed to stay out of prison while the appeal unfolds — a request that has now been rebuffed by both Davila and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Tougher work requirements for federal aid programs pose obstacle in debt limit talks,Sahil Kapur,"May 16, 2023, 10:14 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — As House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden seek an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, Republican demands to impose tougher work requirements for federal aid programs have emerged as an obstacle to finding consensus. The debt ceiling bill House Republicans passed last month, which was negotiated between GOP members and approved along party lines, would expand work requirements for some federal aid programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a program that provides grocery aid. The proposal has drawn a backlash from many Democrats who oppose such provisions. But while Biden has said cuts to federal aid that could throw people into poverty are off the table, he has also signaled that he may be open to some limited concessions on work requirements to reach a spending deal. Biden told reporters Sunday that he “voted for tougher aid programs” when he was a senator. “That’s in the law now,” he said. “But for Medicaid, it’s a different story.” McCarthy, R-Calif., who has said including work requirements is a red line in the talks, declined to discuss details after Tuesday’s meeting. “I’m not gonna negotiate with all of you. We know where we need to get to,” he said. The Republican-backed proposal had required intraparty negotiations, and details were a point of contention. But tougher work requirements won't fly with many Democrats. It's “a nonstarter for me,” Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said in an interview on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” arguing that the cuts are harmful and ineffective. “Work requirements don’t make people work more. What it does is deprive of folks who need the help. It’s just cruel.” The House GOP bill would require states to implement work requirements for some people on Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people. It would also require able-bodied adults up to age 55 to work a minimum of 20 hours per week or satisfy other criteria to get SNAP benefits for more than three months every three years. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said it wasn’t possible to get an agreement on such a contentious issue in a short time frame; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter Monday that the U.S. could breach the debt ceiling as soon as June 1. ""How are you going to work that out? How are you going to work an issue that complicated, that affects that many lives, in seven to 10 days?"" Murphy said. ""It just feels impossible."" White House spokesman Michael Kikukawa noted in a statement that Biden has supported work requirements for federal aid programs in the past. “The work requirements on cash assistance that the president voted for in the 1990s are still the law today,” Kikukawa said. “As the President said, Medicaid is a different story, and the President has been clear that he will not accept proposals that take away people’s health coverage. The president has also been clear that he will not accept policies that push Americans into poverty.” Kikukawa added, “He will evaluate whatever proposals Republicans bring to the table based on those principles.” Biden struck a tougher line against the push Monday, when he appeared to rule out changes to SNAP, tweeting that Republicans were threatening food aid for seniors. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., threw cold water on tougher work requirements, saying they’re already law for most federal programs. “I know this is raw meat for the Republicans to talk about the ‘welfare queens’ and the like, but the reality is when we’re talking about children getting food stamps to survive on, work requirements don’t make any sense at all,” Durbin said Tuesday. “To make this the center point of our negotiation to crater the American economy is ridiculous.” Other Democrats have pushed back against the idea of work requirements, including Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. “SNAP already has work requirements. I didn’t come here to take food away from hungry kids, and that’s exactly what this proposal would do; a proposal that would make Scrooge blush,” Fetterman said on Twitter, referring to the House GOP plan. “I’ve never met a SNAP recipient who aspires to stay on SNAP for life."" House Rules Committee Chair Tom Cole, R-Okla., wouldn't say Tuesday whether stricter work requirements are a red line for him. ""I don't know. I think they're very important. I think our position is eminently reasonable,"" Cole said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he supports the House-passed bill and its work requirements. ""I think it's reasonable,"" he said Tuesday. ""And apparently the president upset some of the progressive base. ... So I think that's part of the negotiation."" CORRECTION (May 17, 2023, 5:45 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Ro Khanna’s congressional position. He is a member of the House, not a senator. "
'Taco Tuesday' trademark tiff flares anew between fast food competitors,The Associated Press,"May 16, 2023, 9:45 PM UTC",Business News,"Declaring a mission to liberate “Taco Tuesday” for all, Taco Bell is asking U.S. regulators to force Wyoming-based Taco John’s to abandon its longstanding claim to the trademark. Too many businesses and others refer to “Taco Tuesday” for Taco John’s to be able to have exclusive rights to the phrase, Taco Bell asserts in a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filing that is, of course, dated Tuesday. It’s the latest development in a long-running beef over Taco Tuesday that even included NBA star LeBron James making an unsuccessful attempt to claim the trademark in 2019. “Taco Bell believes ‘Taco Tuesday’ is critical to everyone’s Tuesday. To deprive anyone of saying ‘Taco Tuesday’ — be it Taco Bell or anyone who provides tacos to the world — is like depriving the world of sunshine itself,” the Taco Bell filing reads. With more than 7,200 locations in the U.S. and internationally, Taco Bell — a Yum! Brands chain along with Pizza Hut, KFC and The Habit Burger Grill — is vastly bigger than Cheyenne-based Taco John’s. Begun as a food truck more than 50 years ago, Taco John’s now has about 370 locations in 23 mainly Midwestern and Western states. The chain’s relatively small size hasn’t discouraged big-time enforcement of “Taco Tuesday” as trademark, which dates to the 1980s. In 2019, the company sent a letter to a brewery just five blocks from its corporate headquarters, warning it to stop using “Taco Tuesday” to promote a taco truck parked outside on Tuesdays. Actively defending a trademark is key to maintaining claim to it, and the letter was just one example of Taco John’s telling restaurants far and wide that nobody else may use “Taco Tuesday.” Taco John’s responded to Taco Bell’s filing by announcing a new two-week Taco Tuesday promotion, with a large side of riposte. “I’d like to thank our worthy competitors at Taco Bell for reminding everyone that Taco Tuesday is best celebrated at Taco John’s,” CEO Jim Creel said in an emailed statement. “We love celebrating Taco Tuesday with taco lovers everywhere, and we even want to offer a special invitation to fans of Taco Bell to liberate themselves by coming by to see how flavorful and bold tacos can be at Taco John’s all month long.” Yet “Taco Tuesday” has such widespread use and recognition these days — as a generic way of promoting tacos on a specific day of the week — that Taco John’s still can’t claim exclusive ownership, Taco Bell claims in its filing. “‘Taco Tuesday’ is a common phrase. Nobody should have exclusive rights in a common phrase. Can you imagine if we weren’t allowed to say ‘what’s up’ or ‘brunch?’ Chaos,” reads Taco Bell’s document, written with a dollop of spicy marketing language. The filing is one of two from Taco Bell involving “Taco Tuesday.” One contests Taco John’s claim to “Taco Tuesday” in 49 states, along with a similar filing that contests a New Jersey restaurant and bar’s claim to “Taco Tuesday” in that state. Both Taco John’s and Gregory’s Restaurant and Bar in Somers Point, New Jersey, have been using “Taco Tuesday” for over 40 years. A Taco John’s franchisee in Minnesota came up with “Taco Twosday” to promote two tacos for 99 cents on a slow day of the week, Creel told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday. The Patent and Trademark Office approved the “Taco Tuesday” trademark in 1989. And while Taco John’s sends letters asking other businesses not to use “Taco Tuesday,” the company has never had to go to court over the phrase, Creel said. He’s not feeling too picked on, either, by the much bigger Taco Bell. “It’s OK. It’s kind of nice that they’ve noticed,” Creel said. "
Biden and congressional leaders strike optimistic tone after debt ceiling meeting,Katherine Doyle,"May 16, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC / Updated May 16, 2023, 9:27 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met Tuesday afternoon to discuss a way to break the logjam on the debt ceiling, with fears of a self-inflicted economic calamity growing as Republicans demand spending cuts. Leaving the meeting, congressional leaders hinted at some progress. McCarthy, R-Calif., said that the sides remain “far apart"" but that “it is possible to get a deal by the end of the week.” Failure to reach an agreement to lift the borrowing limit threatens the first-ever default on the nation’s $31.4 trillion debt, an outcome that could prove catastrophic for the U.S. economy and upend the political landscape. The abridged timeline was front and center in remarks by congressional leaders after the sit-down. McCarthy acknowledged there is a ""lot of work to do in a short amount of time"" and said it was “unfortunate that we are where we are.” But he said, ""If this is where we were in February ... I’d be very optimistic that we’d get this done right away.” McCarthy praised efforts to streamline the talks, telling reporters that Biden had selected Steve Ricchetti, a close adviser to the president, and Shalanda Young, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, to negotiate directly with the speaker's team. (A White House spokesperson confirmed the selections.) On the Republican side, Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., and aides to McCarthy will take the lead, he said. Biden is ""finally"" taking the advice of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., McCarthy added. ""Appoint somebody from the president's team who can work with the speaker's team to see if we could come to an agreement,"" he said. ""Had we done this back 97 days ago, we’d already have a bill."" Biden said there was an “overwhelming consensus” among the leaders that defaulting on the debt was not an option. That outcome would threaten a recession, devastate retirement accounts, force layoffs and deliver a blow to the nation’s reputation around the world, he said. He said it was a “good, productive meeting,” appearing confident that default could be averted even as the clock ticks and he prepares to leave town. Before Tuesday, the White House and Democrats had portrayed House Republicans as the only party to the talks willing to accept default as an outcome, heaping pressure on McCarthy as a holdout who risked upending the economy. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was hopeful a deal could be reached as leaders coalesce behind a plan. “We all came to agreement that we were going to continue discussions,"" Schumer said. “Hopefully, we can come to an agreement. We don’t have much time. But default is just the worst, worst alternative.” The White House said that the meeting was “productive and direct” and that Biden hopes to check in with the leaders by phone while he is traveling overseas this week and to meet with them again when he returns. Biden leaves for Japan on Wednesday to attend a summit of the Group of Seven major industrial countries. With talks continuing and a deal not yet within reach, the White House said Tuesday that Biden would cut his trip short and return Sunday. The White House expects staff-level talks will continue while Biden is overseas, and he will be briefed daily while traveling, a source familiar with the negotiations said. White House officials said before the meeting that they did not expect any kind of completed framework, a source familiar with the discussions said. One area of contention is GOP demands to impose tougher work requirements for federal aid programs, which faces Democratic pushback. The House-passed proposal, negotiated among GOP members and approved on party lines, would require able-bodied adults up to age 55 to work a minimum of 20 hours per week or satisfy other criteria to get food stamps for more than three months every three years. But staffers have identified potential areas of common ground in daily talks over the last six days, including reform of permitting for energy and infrastructure projects and the possibility of negotiating spending cuts on a parallel track to raising the debt ceiling. McCarthy had sounded a pessimistic tone Monday, saying: ""I don’t think we’re in a good place. I know we’re not.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter Monday that the U.S. is still projected to exhaust all options to keep paying the country’s bills as early as June 1, leaving Congress with less than three weeks to avert a potential worst-case scenario. In remarks before the meeting Tuesday, Yellen stressed the urgency of striking a deal and warned of stark economic implications “if Congress has not acted to address the debt limit by early June, and potentially as early as June 1.” “It’s impossible to predict with certainty the exact date when Treasury will be unable to pay off the governments bills,” she said at the Independent Community Bankers of America’s 2023 Capital Summit. Biden and congressional leaders were originally scheduled to meet last Friday but pushed the meeting to Tuesday to give staff-level negotiators more time to develop a framework for the principals to discuss. The group, which includes McCarthy, Schumer, McConnell and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., met last Tuesday and included Vice President Kamala Harris for the first time. Since last week, White House and Capitol Hill staffers have held private meetings to consider a path forward, but they have been tight-lipped about the details of the negotiations. Schumer insisted Monday that default must “be off the table.” “Speaker McCarthy must commit to the same,” he said. “The consequences of default are too terrible.” Biden, who has been reluctant to characterize the talks while they are ongoing, said last week he is “certain” default can be averted, and he remained hopeful over the weekend. “I remain optimistic because I’m a congenital optimist, but I really think there’s a desire on their part as well as ours to reach agreement,” Biden said Sunday. “I think we’ll be able to do it.” The Republican-led House is demanding spending cuts and policy changes to lift the debt ceiling. Biden and the Democratic-controlled Senate insist that paying the bills is nonnegotiable and that next year’s budget should be dealt with separately. Pressure to reach a deal is growing. The debt ceiling bill passed by House Republicans would cut the budget to fiscal year 2022 levels, slashing $131 billion from current spending. Democrats want to increase spending on health care, education and other domestic priorities, leaving the two sides to find other avenues for spending cuts; one possibility Biden and Republicans have floated is pulling back unspent Covid funds. Another possibility is reforms that would speed the process of getting permits for energy projects backed by the White House and centrist Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Still, Biden has continued to put pressure on Republicans, calling the looming default “a manufactured crisis” and insisting the responsibility falls on Congress to avoid it. "
"More than 200,000 Jeep Cherokee SUVs recalled because they can catch fire when engine is off",The Associated Press,"May 16, 2023, 9:03 PM UTC",Autos,"DETROIT — Stellantis is telling owners of nearly 220,000 Jeep Cherokee SUVs worldwide to park them outdoors and away from other vehicles because the power liftgates can catch fire even when the engines are off. The company is recalling certain Cherokees from the 2014 through 2016 model years. Water can get into the liftgate control computer, causing an electrical short that can touch off a fire. The company says it hasn’t developed a fix yet. Owners will get notification letters starting June 30. Stellantis says the problem was caught in a routine review of customer data. It’s not clear how many of the small SUVs have caught fire. Stellantis says in documents posted Tuesday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it has 50 customer assistance records, 23 warranty claims and 21 field reports due to the issue. The company says it’s not aware of any injuries. The power liftgates may stop working before the SUVs catch fire. Stellantis recalled many of the same vehicles in 2015 to fix a similar problem. "
Wells Fargo will pay $1 billion to settle accusations of defrauding shareholders,Reuters,"May 16, 2023, 7:39 PM UTC",Corporations,"Wells Fargo & Co. has agreed to pay $1 billion to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defrauding shareholders about its progress in recovering from a series of scandals over its treatment of customers. U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan federal court granted preliminary approval on Tuesday to the all-cash settlement, which had been filed the night before. The dollar amount had been suggested by a mediator. Woods scheduled a Sept. 8 hearing to consider final approval. Wells Fargo has operated since 2018 under consent orders from the Federal Reserve and two other financial regulators requiring that it improve governance and oversight. The fourth-largest U.S. bank is also subject to an asset cap by the Fed, limiting its growth and its ability to compete with larger rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.. Shareholders accused Wells Fargo of overstating how well it was complying with those orders, and said the bank’s market value fell by more than $54 billion over two years ending in March 2020 as the shortcomings became known. The San Francisco-based bank denied wrongdoing, and settled to eliminate the burden and cost of litigation, court papers show. “While we disagree with the allegations in this case, we are pleased to have resolved this matter,” Wells Fargo said in a statement. Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 19% of the settlement fund for legal fees. Wells Fargo has since 2016 paid or set aside several billion dollars to resolve regulatory probes and litigation over its business practices. These practices included opening about 3.5 million accounts without customer permission, and charging hundreds of thousands of borrowers for auto insurance they did not need. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf has said repairing the 171-year-old bank founded by Henry Wells and William Fargo has taken longer than he expected when he took over in 2019. “When I arrived, we did not have the culture, effective processes, or appropriate management oversight in place to remediate weaknesses on a timely basis,” he said in his March 3 letter to shareholders. “Today, we approach these issues differently.” The case is In re Wells Fargo & Co Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-04494.

"Recalled Gerber baby formula was sent to U.S. retailers after recall began, wholesaler says",The Associated Press,"May 16, 2023, 6:08 PM UTC",U.S. news,"An infant formula recalled over potential bacteria contamination was distributed to retailers across eight states after the initial recall notice, according to a release published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week. In March, Perrigo Co. issued a voluntary recall of certain lots of its Gerber Good Start SoothePro Powder Infant Formula “out of an abundance of caution” due to the possible presence of Cronobacter sakazakii, a germ that can cause serious or deadly infections in infants. The recall impacted Gerber Good Start formula manufactured between Jan. 2 and Jan. 18 at Perrigo’s Eau Claire, Wisconsin, facility. The recalled formula was sold in three different sizes at retailers nationwide, according to a March 17 recall notice. Cooperative food wholesaler Associated Wholesale Grocers, however, distributed the 12.4-ounce version of the recalled product to its Nashville Division retailers after Perrigo’s initial recall notice was published. As a result, the recalled product was distributed to supermarkets across Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, Associated Wholesale Grocers said Saturday. The wholesaler is urging consumers who purchased Gerber Good Start formula at impacted locations to check their products. The recalled formula sold beyond the start of the recall can be identified by its lot codes and “use by” dates — which range from July 4, 2024, to July 12, 2024. “Any consumers who purchased product with matching codes should discontinue use and dispose of the product,” Associated Wholesale Grocers’ Saturday notice reads, adding that consumers can request a refund by contacting the Gerber Parent Resource Center on behalf of Perrigo. In a statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday, Perrigo said that the company informed all customers at the time of the March recall. The Saturday notice from Associated Wholesale Grocers, which Perrigo identifies as a customer, is “not directly associated with Perrigo and has no impact on the company,” Perrigo said. The company also maintained that the March recall was initiated “out of an abundance of caution” — adding that “no Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria has been found in any product distributed for sale and no adverse events have been reported.” The AP also reached out to Associated Wholesale Grocers for further comment Tuesday morning. Infections caused by Cronobacter sakazakii are rare, but they can be life-threatening for newborns, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention writes. The bacteria can cause sepsis and meningitis, according to the CDC. Cronobacter sakazakii was the same germ that sparked Abbott Nutrition’s recall following a nationwide shortage of powdered infant formula last year. According to the FDA and CDC, Cronobacter sakazakii is found naturally in the environment and is “particularly good” at surviving in dry foods like infant formula — which can get contaminated at home or in processing facilities. The bacteria can also live on home surfaces and other feeding equipment. Experts stress the importance of taking everyday sanitation measures for safety. “There are steps that people can take to prevent infections,” Dr. Julia Haston, a CDC expert in pediatric infectious diseases, previously told the AP — including thoroughly washing, sanitizing and drying hands, equipment and all surfaces before feeding a baby.

Black WGA strikers say they’ve helped streamers boost diversity — and wound up worse off,J.J. McCorvey,"May 16, 2023, 5:23 PM UTC",NBCBLK,"As the Hollywood screenwriters’ strike enters its third week, Black picketers see the push for better pay and contract terms as a way to fortify hard-won gains that they say aren’t generating sufficient returns for creators of color. The Writers Guild of America kicked off its strike May 2, bringing much of the entertainment industry to a halt after failed negotiations triggered the first walkout in nearly 15 years. For weeks, thousands of writers have campaigned for pay increases and changes to a streaming-based business model that many say has imperiled their livelihoods. Black guild members see the fight as bound up with another one: Improved representation in TV and movies, they say, has come at the cost of sustainable careers for the very writers driving that progress. After nationwide mass protests against the police murder of George Floyd in 2020, streaming operators including Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video joined a wave of major companies that publicly committed to improve racial equity in their ranks and products. Since then, streamers have by some measures earned higher marks for diversity than their traditional counterparts: Minority writers were credited in 20% of streaming films last year, compared to 12.4% of theatrical releases, according to UCLA’s latest Hollywood Diversity Report. But some in the industry say work on the streaming side in particular is becoming more precarious and less remunerative. “They don’t really give shows a chance to find an audience the same way that they used to,” said Kyra Jones, 30, a Los Angeles-based writer and actor. The last two projects Jones wrote for — “Queens,” a musical drama that aired on ABC’s broadcast network featuring the R&B singer Brandy and the rapper Eve, and “Woke,” a comedy that streamed on Hulu about an on-the-verge cartoonist — were canceled after one and two seasons, respectively. Jones said her work on “Queens” has netted her at least $16,000 from residuals, or compensation for content syndication or streams, compared to just $6,000 for “Woke.” Among the WGA’s demands is that studios reconcile pay disparities between broadcast and streaming like the one Jones pointed to. The guild also says streaming shows are canceled more frequently, creating less stable schedules for creators as entertainment giants continue to lean into their streaming offerings. What’s being missed is just how much compensation for writers has shifted with the new era of television. — Charlene Polite Corley, Nielsen A recent WGA survey found that the median weekly pay for writer-producers has shrunk by 23% over the last 10 years when adjusted for inflation. “What’s being missed is just how much compensation for writers has shifted with the new era of television,” said Charlene Polite Corley, a vice president and the head of diverse insights and initiatives at Nielsen. A spokesperson for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents major media companies in negotiations with the WGA, referred to previous statements about the strike, saying that hiring quotas are “incompatible with the creative nature of our industry” and that “writers have only recently begun to see” a 46% increase in streaming residuals following 2020 contract negotiations. NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News, is a member of the AMPTP. Jones said she had started development on a show about Black cowgirls that she recently sold to Freeform, an ABC multiplatform channel aimed at younger viewers, but the strike interrupted that work. Her savings — and her parents — will help her “stay alive” in Los Angeles, she said, even if she has to find a new apartment with a roommate. In the meantime, she got a second job at Northwestern University as a virtual advocate for students affected by sexual violence. The last WGA strike, which started in late 2007, lasted about three months and left dozens of shows shortened or canceled. The popular Tracee Ellis Ross-led comedy “Girlfriends,” for example, ended abruptly without a series finale in early 2008. Black social media users have speculated recently whether other shows featuring racial minorities could meet similar fates this time. "
Elon Musk to be subpoenaed for documents in Virgin Islands' Epstein lawsuit against JPMorgan,"Dan Mangan, CNBC","May 16, 2023, 11:14 AM UTC",Business News,"The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Tesla CEO Elon Musk seeking documents for that government’s lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase over sex trafficking by the bank’s late longtime customer Jeffrey Epstein, a court filing revealed Monday. That filing said the Virgin Islands has tried unsuccessfully to serve Musk with the subpoena, which was issued on April 28, because of suspicion that Epstein “may have referred or attempted to refer” Musk as a client to JPMorgan. The U.S. territory asked Manhattan federal court Judge Jed Rakoff in the filing to allow it to serve Musk with the subpoena with Tesla’s registered agent. That subpoena demands Musk turn over any documents showing communication involving him, JPMorgan and Epstein, as well as “all Documents reflecting or regarding Epstein’s involvement in human trafficking and/or his procurement of girls or women for consensual sex.” The Virgin Islands is suing JPMorgan for allegedly enabling and benefiting from Epstein’s trafficking of young women to his private island in the territory to be abused by him and others. JPMorgan denies the government’s claims, which are mirrored in a separate pending civil lawsuit in Manhattan federal court by a woman who says Epstein sexually abused her. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is due to be deposed for both lawsuits beginning on May 26. A May 4 court filing by the Virgin Islands revealed the government had issued a similar subpoena for documents to Google co-founder Larry Page, and that it likewise was having difficulty locating Page. And the territory previously issued subpoenas to Page’s fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin, former Disney executive Michael Ovitz, Hyatt Hotels executive chairman Thomas Pritzker and Mort Zuckerman, the billionaire real estate investor. In Monday’s filing, the Virgin Islands said, “Upon information and belief, Elon Musk — the CEO of Tesla, Inc., among other companies — is a high-net-worth individual who Epstein may have referred or attempted to refer to JPMorgan.” In addition to being CEO of Tesla, Musk is head of SpaceX and owner of Twitter. The government said that it had hired an investigative firm to try to locate an address from Musk, and also contacted one of his lawyers. That lawyer in past federal cases has waived the requirement of him being personally served with legal documents, according to the filing. “The Government contacted Mr. Musk’s counsel via email to ask if he would be authorized to accept service on Mr. Musk’s behalf in this matter but did not receive a response confirming or denying his authority,” the filing said. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CNBC. But on Monday night, Musk did reply to a Twitter user, @unusual_whales, who had tweeted this article. “This is idiotic on so many levels,” Musk wrote in his Twitter reply. “1. That cretin never advised me on anything whatsoever. 2. The notion that I would need or listen to financial advice from a dumb crook is absurd.” “3. JPM let Tesla down ten years ago, despite having Tesla’s global commercial banking business, which we then withdrew,” Musk wrote. “I have never forgiven them.” In 2018, Epstein told The New York Times writer James Stewart that he had been advising Musk after the Securities and Exchange Commission opened a probe into Musk’s comments about taking the company private. When the Times reached out to Tesla for comment, the company strongly denied that claim, saying, “It is incorrect to say that Epstein ever advised Elon on anything.” Epstein had predicted to Stewart that “everyone at Tesla would deny talking to him or being his friend,” according to an article about their interview. Epstein, a former friend of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of Britain, was a customer of the bank from 1998 through 2013. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to a state charge in Florida of soliciting sex from an underage girl. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019, a month after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges. "
Washington is struggling to catch up on artificial intelligence,Scott Wong,"May 15, 2023, 9:53 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"As industry experts and academics sound alarm bells, Washington has quickly turned its attention to artificial intelligence. But there’s hardly a coordinated approach when it comes to regulating the fast-moving technology. President Joe Biden's administration has rolled out a number of executive actions to study the technology, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is working with experts and stakeholders to develop a broad legislative framework for regulating AI. Without a clear game plan for tackling the issue, multiple committees on Capitol Hill are holding their own public hearings and private meetings to try to address AI capabilities that fall within their jurisdictions. “The reality is the development of AI is at warp speed and none of us can keep up with it,” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said in an interview. “I do think it’s important for us, together, to talk about what the values are that we hope to enhance and preserve and protect with AI,” he said, “but we’re a long way from having a coordinated approach.” This week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, one of the nation’s leading voices on artificial intelligence, will address members of Congress as they try to get up to speed. Altman will speak to House Republicans and Democrats during a dinner discussion hosted by GOP Conference Vice Chair Mike Johnson, of Louisiana, and Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Ted Lieu, of California, on Monday night. Then on Tuesday, Altman will testify about AI for the first time on Capitol Hill, appearing before a Judiciary subcommittee on privacy and technology led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Many tech leaders have called for some sort of regulation or guidelines for the AI industry, though few have offered detailed policy proposals. In March, thousands of tech leaders and academics signed an open letter calling for companies to pause new experiments with giant AI models for at least six months, with some apocalyptic warnings, though there’s no indication that any of the major companies in the field plan to do so. Rather than proposing sweeping AI legislation that could take years to enact, the Biden administration is using its existing authority to try to shape AI technologies and ensure they are developed and used responsibly. This month, on the same day Vice President Kamala Harris huddled with Altman and other AI leaders, the White House announced a series of executive actions, including a $140 million investment to launch seven new AI research facilities and new AI guidelines for federal agencies. Last fall, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy rolled out an “AI Bill of Rights” — a road map for tech companies and other entities as they make and deploy powerful and potentially dangerous AI tools. The blueprint is nonbinding, but administration officials argue that the onus is on businesses — and the broader AI industry itself — to ensure that their products are safe and secure. Several agencies, including the Justice Department and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, have said they’re watching for automated systems that might discriminate illegally, like algorithms that might deny a person housing based on their race. The Federal Trade Commission has threatened to investigate companies that overhype their use of AI for potential false advertising. Even some lawmakers aggressively pushing for new AI legislation see the advantage of Biden taking executive action to try to influence the rapid development of AI tools, from OpenAI’s enormously popular chatbot ChatGPT to AI image generators and voice cloning software that are fooling everyday Americans. “The tremendous advantage of using existing agencies and regulatory framework is that a new legislative initiative on AI would be immensely difficult — from an intellectual and legal standpoint but also a political perspective,” Blumenthal said. “Just think of how long and hard we’ve worked on privacy, which is complex and difficult but may be child’s play compared to AI regulation.” Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt argued on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that the AI industry needs to come up with regulations before the government tries to step in ""because there's no way a nonindustry person can understand what is possible."" ""It's just too new, too hard, there's not the expertise,"" Schimdt said. ""There's no one in the government who can get it right. But the industry can roughly get it right and then the government can put a regulatory structure around it."" Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said last week at a “Hack the Capitol” cybersecurity conference that there may be a regulatory solution to AI security concerns. But she added: “Businesses should be organized at the top level to put a priority on safety and security.” ""That doesn’t mean you can’t have innovation — you can have innovation — you just can’t think about it as innovation is incompatible with security and safety,"" she continued. Steve DelBianco, a tech industry lobbyist who opposes government regulation on AI, said that federal regulators and lawmakers have been forced to play catch-up to Silicon Valley in the past, with technologies like social media. “Washington doesn’t trust Silicon Valley to have thought through the consequences and disruptions of technologies that they’ve rolled out,” DelBianco said. Regulators and lawmakers “are competing for the spotlight, to show that they’re taking the lead to protect constituents, protect consumers” when it comes to AI, he said. While Washington’s approach to addressing AI may now seem disjointed, policymakers, regulators and White House officials are having lots of conversations about it. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who is the Judiciary Committee chairman, organized an AI briefing at the White House on May 3 with Arati Prabhakar, head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Durbin’s office confirmed. Roughly 20 senators, Democrats and Republicans, attended the meeting. Blumenthal called AI the “new bright, shiny object” in Washington, and he said he doesn’t see a problem with a more organic, bottom-up approach to developing regulations in these early stages. “I sort of see this phase as germinating ideas and coalescing around the ideas that make sense, but there doesn’t have to be a kind of, you know, top-down approach. I think, let 1,000 flowers bloom,” Blumenthal told NBC News. Still, he argued that the executive branch will need to take the lead given that international cooperation will be required, similar to the Human Genome Project of the 1990s and early 2000s. “Ultimately, presidential leadership is absolutely necessary here,” Blumenthal said. “There’s so many international implications. Congress can’t conduct negotiations with the Chinese on whether they’re going to follow standards or rules that we adopt.” Other lawmakers say they are looking at tackling the AI challenge in smaller bites. The Senate Armed Services subcommittee on emerging threats held a closed-door briefing last week where AI issues were discussed, said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. And he said there will be a lot of focus on AI issues in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act, the massive defense policy bill Congress must pass each year. ""I think the pace of discussions on AI on many committees is picking up right now,"" Kaine said. Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., a video game developer who has a master’s degree in AI from UCLA, said he’s part of House-Senate talks to form a congressional AI working group that can hammer out issues ahead of time so they don’t slow down a legislative package. “We’re in the very early stages of formulating what a regulatory framework might look like. And I think that as the effort gets a little more mature, you’re going to see more coordination,” Obernolte said. “The goal,” he said, “will be to have a bipartisan, bicameral working group so we can put together something that doesn’t have to go through the torturous process of being modified and completely changed as it moves from committee to House, and House to Senate.” Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., a Biden ally who serves on the Commerce panel, said he is committed to passing AI legislation on issues he cares about, particularly around national security and film and music copyright infringement. He predicted that Biden would back AI legislation if Congress sends it to his desk. “I appreciate what the executive branch is doing,” Luján said. “I’m a lawmaker, and I’m a legislator, and we move legislation. We build packages together. We find consensus.” "
Treasury Secretary Yellen says the U.S. risks breaching the debt ceiling on June 1,Sahil Kapur,"May 15, 2023, 8:31 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. is still projected to breach the debt ceiling as early as June 1, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated in a new letter to Congress on Monday afternoon. Yellen's confirmation of the deadline means Congress has less than three weeks to act or risk a first-ever debt default, which carries grave economic consequences and could tip the country into a recession. “With additional information now available, I am writing to note that we still estimate that Treasury will likely no longer be able to satisfy all of the government’s obligations if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by early June, and potentially as early as June 1,"" Yellen wrote in the letter. Yellen’s letter comes one day before an expected meeting between President Joe Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy about how to avert an unprecedented — and economically disastrous — debt default. Biden and the Democratic-led Senate have been at odds with the Republican-controlled House on how to tackle the issue. McCarthy sounded skeptical on Monday morning. “I still think we’re far apart” on debt ceiling negotiations, he said after staff met over the weekend. “It doesn’t seem to me yet that they want a deal,” he said, referring to Democrats and the White House. “It seems like they want to look like they’re in a meeting. … They’re not talking anything serious.” It remains unclear what an agreement would look like. The two parties haven't yet established the parameters of the negotiations, though there has been consideration of linking the debt limit to a budget negotiation to satisfy demands from both parties. One hurdle is how to allocate any potential spending cuts between the military and non-defense portions of the federal budget. “It never is good to characterize a negotiation in the middle of the negotiation,” Biden told reporters on Sunday. “I remain optimistic because I’m a congenital optimist, but I really think there’s a desire on their part as well as ours to reach agreement. I think we’ll be able to do it.” The U.S. hit the statutory debt limit in January and has since been using ""extraordinary measures"" to pay the bills. The Treasury Department has consistently given a timeline of early June for Congress to act or risk breaching the debt ceiling. The specific date has been adjusted a few times along the way based on tax receipts, as is customary when setting the deadline. “What worries me is that [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, even [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell have said that if we can’t get an agreement in the next few weeks, default is off the table,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Sunday on NBC’s ""Meet The Press."" “The only leader who says we are going to light the American economy on fire if we can’t get an agreement in the next ten-to-14 days is Kevin McCarthy.” Schumer said Monday that default should be off the table. ""It would be a catastrophe. No one should play with it. No one should flirt with it. No one should hold it hostage,"" he said on the Senate floor. ""The consequences of default are just awful."" Schumer said he believes Congress should lift the debt ceiling if there's no deal reached in time. ""Speaker McCarthy must commit to the same,"" he said. "
"Elon Musk still needs 'Twitter sitter,' judges rule","Rohan Goswami, CNBC","May 15, 2023, 6:03 PM UTC",Business News,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk lost an appeal to unwind parts of a consent decree that he and the automaker struck with the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil securities fraud charges in 2018. The ruling, issued Monday by a federal appeals court, affirms a prior decision from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which issued the initial denial. Musk has litigated with the SEC for years over the consent decree, which was revised in 2019 after the SEC charged Musk with making “false and misleading” statements in his August 2018 “funding secured” tweets. The Tesla CEO said he had found a buyer to take the automaker private at $420 a share, a claim which a federal judge later found to be false. The agreement required “pre-approval” for tweets by Musk that contained information material to Tesla, and which extended to “certain senior executives,” according to the judgment. A February letter from Musk attorney Alex Spiro said the terms of the consent decree amounted to “unconstitutional” infringement of his free-speech rights. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed those claims, writing that the court saw “no evidence to support Musk’s contention that the SEC has used the consent decree to conduct bad-faith, harassing investigations of his protected speech.” The court noted that the SEC had opened “just three inquiries” into his tweets since 2018: over his “funding secured” tweet, a tweet that misstated Tesla’s annual production numbers, and a Twitter poll where Musk proposed selling 10% of his Tesla shares, according to the court filing. Far from the investigations being in “bad-faith,” the court wrote that “each tweet plausibly violated the terms of the consent decree.” Musk’s attorneys also put forward an argument under Rule 60(b), which allows a party to reopen their case if the law or the situation has changed significantly. Musk’s legal team argued that the SEC’s methods of enforcement made compliance “substantially more onerous.” But the court dismissed that argument as well, noting that Musk was merely required to consult with Tesla’s general counsel or an in-house securities lawyer. Musk’s Twitter activity has been the subject of both SEC and shareholder attention. Musk was found “not liable” in a February securities fraud trial over his “funding secured” tweets. Musk has also been fending off a lawsuit involving his public boosting of the cryptocurrency dogecoin. The court added that if Musk had concerns about SEC oversight over his “right to tweet without even limited internal oversight,” he could have defended himself against the SEC’s charges or negotiated a different settlement. “But he chose not to do so,” the court emphasized. “Having made that choice,” the court concluded, Musk’s team couldn’t argue “to collaterally reopen a final judgment merely because he has now changed his mind.” “We will seek further review and continue to bring attention to the important issue of the government constraint on speech,” Musk’s attorney Spiro said in a statement to CNBC.

TSA tests facial recognition technology to boost airport security,Associated Press,"May 15, 2023, 1:01 PM UTC",Tech News,"A passenger walks up to an airport security checkpoint, slips an ID card into a slot and looks into a camera atop a small screen. The screen flashes “Photo Complete” and the person walks through — all without having to hand over their identification to the TSA officer sitting behind the screen. It’s all part of a pilot project by the Transportation Security Administration to assess the use of facial recognition technology at a number of airports across the country. “What we are trying to do with this is aid the officers to actually determine that you are who you say who you are,” said Jason Lim, identity management capabilities manager, during a demonstration of the technology to reporters at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. The effort comes at a time when the use of various forms of technology to enhance security and streamline procedures is only increasing. TSA says the pilot is voluntary and accurate, but critics have raised concerns about questions of bias in facial recognition technology and possible repercussions for passengers who want to opt out. The technology is currently in 16 airports. In addition to Baltimore, it’s being used at Reagan National near Washington, D.C., airports in Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, San Jose, and Gulfport-Biloxi and Jackson in Mississippi. However, it’s not at every TSA checkpoint so not every traveler going through those airports would necessarily experience it. Travelers put their driver’s license into a slot that reads the card or place their passport photo against a card reader. Then they look at a camera on a screen about the size of an iPad, which captures their image and compares it to their ID. The technology is both checking to make sure the people at the airport match the ID they present and that the identification is in fact real. A TSA officer is still there and signs off on the screening. A small sign alerts travelers that their photo will be taken as part of the pilot and that they can opt out if they’d like. It also includes a QR code for them to get more information. Since it’s come out the pilot has come under scrutiny by some elected officials and privacy advocates. In a February letter to TSA, five senators — four Democrats and an Independent who is part of the Democratic caucus — demanded the agency stop the program, saying: “Increasing biometric surveillance of Americans by the government represents a risk to civil liberties and privacy rights.” As various forms of technology that use biometric information like face IDs, retina scans or fingerprint matches have become more pervasive in both the private sector and the federal government, it’s raised concerns among privacy advocates about how this data is collected, who has access to it and what happens if it gets hacked.

The Philadelphia Inquirer wasn't able to print its Sunday newspaper due to a cyberattack,The Associated Press,"May 15, 2023, 12:05 PM UTC",News,"PHILADELPHIA — The Philadelphia Inquirer experienced the most significant disruption to its operations in 27 years due to what the newspaper calls a cyberattack. The company was working to restore print operations after a cyber incursion that prevented the printing of the newspaper’s Sunday print edition, the Inquirer reported on its website. The news operation’s website was still operational Sunday, although updates were slower than normal, the Inquirer reported. Inquirer publisher Lisa Hughes said Sunday “we are currently unable to provide an exact time line” for full restoration of the paper’s systems. “We appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding as we work to fully restore systems and complete this investigation as soon as possible,” Hughes said in an email responding to questions from the paper’s newsroom. The attack was first detected when employees on Saturday morning found the newspaper’s content-management system was not working. The Inquirer “discovered anomalous activity on select computer systems and immediately took those systems off-line,” Hughes said. The cyberattack has caused the largest disruption to the publication of Pennsylvania’s largest news organization since a massive blizzard in January 1996, the Inquirer reported. The cyberattack precedes a mayoral primary election scheduled for Tuesday. Hughes said the operational disruption would not affect news coverage of the election, although journalists would be unable to use the newsroom on election night. Hughes said other Inquirer employees will not be allowed to use offices through at least Tuesday, and the company was looking into coworking arrangements for Tuesday, the Inquirer reported. An investigation was ongoing into the extent and specific targets of the attack, and the company has contacted the FBI, Hughes said. The FBI in Philadelphia declined to comment in response to questions from Inquirer journalists, the newspaper reported. "
The big problem with trying to cut spending in a debt ceiling bill,Sahil Kapur,"May 15, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — House Republicans are pushing Democrats to accept a debt ceiling bill that limits how much money Congress is allowed to spend next year. But achieving that goal — and making it stick — would require breaking a logjam between the two parties that has persisted for over a decade: how to divvy up spending between military and domestic priorities. Republicans want higher defense spending and Democrats want more money for nondefense programs like health care, education and help for veterans. In recent years, the two parties struck a detente: Just increase both, and everybody gets a win. Now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and his conservative allies want to shatter that compact, arguing that spending is out of control. But slashing domestic funding without touching the military, as many Republicans want to do, won't fly with Democrats. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., chair of the powerful Rules Committee, said defense spending should be spared because “it’s a very dangerous world right now."" “Look, I think threats set defense spending. Domestic priorities are wants and desires, but you don’t necessarily get everything. Defense is, to me, a very different level of commitment,” he said. Democrats made clear they want equal treatment between the two. “There is certain parity between defense and nondefense” spending, said Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. “And that’s an issue that’s important in our caucus.” Heading into an expected meeting between President Joe Biden and congressional leaders this week, Republican lawmakers say an agreement on ""spending caps"" is important in securing their support to avert a dangerous debt default. The House-passed debt ceiling bill would slash federal spending to fiscal year 2022 levels, requiring appropriators charged with allocating government funding to cut $131 billion compared with what Congress is currently spending. Meeting that target without cutting defense funding would require a steep 17% cut to nondefense discretionary spending. “Democrats will not let nondefense take a disproportionate share of deep cuts. So Republicans will have to moderate their cut demands if they want to spare defense,” said Brian Riedl, a former Senate Republican policy aide who now works at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative public policy think tank. Riedl said they may be able to avoid the dispute by freezing spending rather than making cuts, suggesting “a two-year freeze” on federal spending as one possible endgame. Republicans have avoided specifying what they'd cut, other than suggesting they could avoid cuts to military spending. When the White House argued that the House GOP's debt ceiling bill — with its lack of specificity on spending cuts — would mean harmful cuts to veterans' funding in the nondefense part of the budget, GOP leaders insisted they could spare veterans from cuts, too. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has trashed that bill as the ""Default on America Act"" and insisted that the debt limit and government funding be handled independently. “This is too important for brinksmanship and reckless ultimatums,” Schumer wrote in a letter Friday. “White House staff, along with aides from my office, the Speaker’s office, Leader McConnell’s office, and Leader Jeffries’ office will continue to meet in an attempt to find a constructive way forward.” McConnell is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Jeffries is House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. Liam Donovan, a Republican lobbyist who analyzes legislative dynamics, said that both sides could agree to impose a spending cap for just one year. They could also agree on policy goals short of announcing an exact spending number. He suggested they could pair cuts with policies seen as creating “savings” and “growth.” “Once you agree upon policy parameters, it becomes much more straightforward — a deal on top-line spending for at least one year, savings from unused Covid funds, a commitment to work on permitting [reform] or some other growth-oriented areas of mutual interest,” Donovan said.

Vice Media files for bankruptcy protection to facilitate sale,Reuters,"May 15, 2023, 8:11 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Vice Media Group, popular for websites such as Vice and Motherboard, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday to engineer its sale to a group of lenders, capping years of financial difficulties and top-executive departures. The bankruptcy filing comes amid a challenging period for several technology and media companies, as they resort to downsizing in recent months due to a turbulent economy and weak advertising market. Vice was among a group of fast-rising digital media ventures that once commanded rich valuations as they courted millennial audiences. It rose to prominence alongside its co-founder, Shane Smith, who built his media empire from a single Canadian magazine. In April, the company said it would cancel popular TV program “Vice News Tonight” as part of a broader restructuring that would result in job cuts across the digital media firm’s global news business. Last month, BuzzFeed Inc said it would shutter its news division, which was renowned for its irreverent and probing coverage, but ultimately succumbed to the challenges of its digital-first business model. Vice said that the lender consortium, which includes Fortress Investment Group, Soros Fund Management and Monroe Capital, will provide about $225 million in the form of a credit bid for substantially all of the company’s assets and also assume significant liabilities at closing. Under a credit bid, creditors can swap their secured debt, rather than pay cash, for the company’s assets. The company listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $500 million to $1 billion, according to a court filing. Vice said that it received commitments for debtor-in-possession financing from the lenders, as well as consent to use more than $20 million in cash, which it said will be “more than sufficient” to fund its business throughout the sale process.

Murphy: Biden’s using 14th Amendment for debt ceiling would ‘absolve Congress from being adults’,Summer Concepcion,"May 14, 2023, 3:16 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"As a crucial June debt limit deadline looms without a deal in sight between the White House and congressional leaders, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on Sunday opposed the idea of President Joe Biden’s using the 14th Amendment to unilaterally avert a debt default. In an interview on “Meet the Press,” NBC News' Chuck Todd asked Murphy whether Biden should invoke the 14th Amendment to pay the country’s bills. “I don’t want to give Joe Biden advice, but I think we should do our job,” Murphy said. “I think that’s a precedent to just absolve Congress from being adults.” Amid the ongoing stalemate in Congress over raising the debt ceiling, Biden said last week that he was considering the 14th Amendment option to bypass the standoff. While he hasn't ruled it out, The Associated Press reported that the president regards invoking the 14th Amendment — which has primarily been used to address citizenship and equality issues — as a problematic, untested legal strategy to ensure the nation is able to meet its financial obligations. The amendment states that the “validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned.” Previous administrations have considered invoking the 14th Amendment to raise the borrowing limit, but they never used it — including the Obama administration in which Biden served as vice president. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen opposed using the 14th Amendment last week, saying it would spark a “constitutional crisis.” Yellen has also warned that if Congress doesn't act in time, the U.S. could start defaulting on its debts as early as June 1. Biden met with congressional leaders last Tuesday at the Oval Office, but they failed to reach a deal on the impending default crisis. A follow-up meeting that was set for last Friday was postponed until this week, three sources told NBC News. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said that all parties agreed to the postponement and that it should not be read as a sign that talks are falling apart. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., a close McCarthy ally, told reporters Thursday: “You need a certain number of these performative meetings before you get to productive meetings."" Biden told reporters Saturday that he believes the debt ceiling talks are “moving along.” “It’s hard to tell,” Biden said. “They’re not, they’ve not reached the crunch point yet. But there is real discussions about some changes being made, but we’re not there yet.” House Republicans have been pushing to attach spending cuts to a debt ceiling increase, while Democrats are reluctant to negotiate over whether to pay the country’s bills or default and have insisted on a clean debt limit hike. They want Congress to negotiate over spending cuts that Republicans have demanded in the separate government funding process, which has a deadline of Sept. 30. Murphy said Sunday that he is “pretty skeptical” that there will be an agreement on the debt ceiling in the next two weeks. “Well, if we want to get serious about deficit reduction, then you have to put tax increases for billionaires and corporations on the table,” Murphy said. “The only leader who says we are going to light the American economy on fire, if we can’t get an agreement in the next 10 to 14 days, is Kevin McCarthy,” Murphy continued. “And that is deeply worrying to me.” "
"This summer’s travel trends: Shorter, cheaper trips and more driving — unless you’re rich",Harriet Baskas,"May 14, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",Travel,"If you sat out last summer’s overcrowded, overpriced, booked-solid travel season in hope of cheaper and easier getaways this year, you may be out of luck. Sixty-three percent of U.S. adults plan to travel this summer, up from 61% this time last year, according to a recent survey by Bankrate, a consumer-finance data provider. Airlines are bracing for high demand, and aviation authorities are warning of another season of flight disruptions. The expectations come as inflation eased to 4.9% in April after having peaked at 9.1% last June and as the Biden administration’s ending of the pandemic emergency officially concludes the era of Covid-related travel restrictions, which have largely evaporated anyhow. Clients are just willing to pay whatever it costs to do what they have been waiting to do for three years. — Sandy Staples, owner of Artistico Travel This summer, wealthier people increasingly plan to shell out for trips while lower earners pull back, industry analysts and travel experts say. “Clients are just willing to pay whatever it costs to do what they have been waiting to do for three years,” said Sandy Staples, owner of the luxury travel agency Artistico Travel in Granite Bay, California. “We have clients doing a massive cruise,” she said, “and the round-trip business class airfare to Iceland was over $11,000 per person. They paid it.” Among households earning over $100,000 annually, 81% are likely to take summer vacations, Bankrate found, up from 75% last year. At the other end of the spectrum, just 54% of households making under $50,000 said the same, down from 56% a year ago. Many travel costs are still rising faster than headline inflation, said Sally French, a travel expert at the personal finance company NerdWallet. “Because inflation is already high as is, this summer is set to be rough for people seeking to travel affordably,” she said. But rather than shelve summer getaway plans entirely, 80% of travelers told Bankrate that they’re looking for ways to economize. While airline ticket prices have fallen by just 0.9% from a year ago, gasoline prices have plunged by more than 12%, inflation figures show. The airfare tracker Hopper predicts domestic round-trip costs to climb as high as $328 by June — $72 shy of last summer’s record peak but still 4% higher than pre-pandemic. So travelers like Terri Johnson, of Ocala, Florida, are choosing road trips over flying. “I’m going to a wedding in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and then to Raleigh to visit cousins I’ve never met” after having found them on an ancestry platform, Johnson said. “Flying costs more with multiple destinations, so I’m driving,” she said, adding that she’s limiting her hotel stays and taking her own vehicle to avoid high rental car prices. She’ll have plenty of company on the roads. To save money, 26% of vacationers plan to drive rather than fly to their destinations this summer, up from 16% last year, according to Bankrate. The national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $3.54, down from $4.42 a year ago, AAA data shows, and rental car prices fell by more than 11% last month from the year before. Bankrate also found that 29% of summer travelers will be choosing cheaper accommodations or destinations, a bigger share than 22% last year. And 26% — up from 19% — will be traveling fewer days. “We’re taking every opportunity to get away from home but making adjustments for inflation,” said Michael Huntsberger, of McMinnville, Oregon. For this summer’s getaways, his family trimmed two days off a planned trip to California wine country, and they decided to vacation in eastern Canada because it was more affordable than New England. “We couldn’t find a hotel for less than $450 in Portland, Maine, and the cost of traveling from there to Montreal was prohibitive,” he said, “so Ottawa, here we come!” More travelers are also turning to loyalty points and rewards programs to help cut costs, with 34% doing so this year, up from 28% last July, according to research Morning Consult released in March. Cashing in travel points rather than stashing them away not only frees up money for other expenses, but it can also be a good inflation-fighting tactic, said French of NerdWallet. “Just like inflation, points inflation is real,” she said. “Airlines and hotels regularly raise the number of points or miles [required] to book travel,” which means rewards can lose value if you sit on them too long. An overwhelming 85% of travelers told NerdWallet that they plan to put the costs of their summer trips on credit cards, and nearly three-quarters of them said they’ll pay off those charges as soon as a billing statement arrives to avoid interest fees. But, thanks to rising rates, the remaining 26% who said they expect to carry travel-related balances could end up paying a lot more for their trips than they’d planned. The Federal Reserve’s recent quarter-point interest-rate hike “won’t move the needle much” on credit card rates, said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst for Bankrate, but after 10 consecutive increases, “the cumulative effect is significant,” he said. I still make travel a priority and don’t mind using a little more of my savings to maintain the level of experiences. — Marcy Schackne, Hollywood, Florida “The typical credit card holder should soon see a rate that’s 5 percentage points higher than it was in early 2022,” Rossman said. “That makes a big difference if you’re carrying debt from month to month, especially if you’re only making minimum payments.” While 55% of American travelers told the industry research firm Destinations Analysts in March that travel would be a high priority in their spending over the next three months, that was 6 percentage points lower than those who said the same last spring. The group also found a nearly 8-point drop in travelers saying it’s a good time to take a trip, to just 30%. Some travelers are taking the expenses in stride. “It’s more of a mental adjustment that everything will cost more,” said Marcy Schackne, of Hollywood, Florida. “I still make travel a priority and don’t mind using a little more of my savings to maintain the level of experiences.” While Morning Consult found wealthier consumers were more likely than others to ditch their travel plans, Staples said she’s seeing lots of demand: “Summer travel requests have been coming in to the point that my team and I have had to make the decision to not take any additional requests.” “We are definitely seeing the continuation of the ‘revenge travel’ post-pandemic,” she said.

Social Security advocates brace for U.S. debt default with payments to beneficiaries at stake,Rob Wile,"May 13, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"With the odds of a U.S. debt default increasing, Social Security advocates warn beneficiaries they should be prepared in case their payments are interrupted. Negotiations around whether the nation's ability to borrow money should be expanded have been ongoing, but Congress and the White House have yet to reach an agreement on the path forward. The impasse has placed the U.S. in a precarious financial position, and leaves some of the most vulnerable Americans at risk. Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said there is a ""good chance"" that in the event of a default, millions of Americans' benefits would be disrupted. ""Seniors should be prepared if they're financially able,"" Adcock said, adding they should consider putting off discretionary purchases ""so they have enough to tide them over."" But millions of beneficiaries have no financial room to maneuver, Adcock said, noting that about 40% of Social Security recipients, which include Americans who are disabled and those who are widowed, receive 90% of their income from the safety net program. That equates to nearly 27 million people. ""Even though we're a few weeks before a default, they won't have enough to squirrel away to cushion for not getting their payments,"" Adcock said. Analysts suggest it isn't certain that the government will miss payments to Social Security recipients in the event of a default. The matter would likely depend on how much cash is on hand if or when the debt ceiling is breached. The staggered schedule of Social Security payments, which relies on an individual’s birthdate to determine which part of the month they receive them, means not all beneficiaries would be equally affected in a missed or partial-payment scenario. The White House and House Republicans remain at odds after meeting on Wednesday to discuss a resolution to the impasse. NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Ali Vitali reported the meeting was “tense.” Led by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the GOP seeks spending cuts from President Joe Biden in exchange for an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default. On Thursday, the White House said a scheduled follow-up meeting had been postponed. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned a default could come as soon as June 1. When asked for comment, a department spokesperson pointed to Yellen's recent remarks in which she said the Treasury might not be able to pay bills that come due on the day of a default, including payments to Social Security recipients and Medicare providers. ""This would be really the first time in the history of America that we would fail to make payments that are due,"" Yellen said. A McCarthy spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment submitted Thursday. Following Tuesday's meeting, he told reporters there was no ""new movement” in negotiating positions. “Everybody in this meeting reiterated the positions they were at,” before the meeting, McCarthy said outside the White House. Mary Johnson, policy analyst with the Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan advocacy group, said she is far more pessimistic about a resolution this time around compared with 2011, the last time a debt-ceiling crisis unfolded. By law, Johnson said, the Social Security Administration cannot spend more money than it has on hand, which she said appears to pre-empt any other possible workaround, absent an agreement between Republicans and the Biden administration. ""We are so extremely divided, and there is such a big chance of a stalemate,"" Johnson said. ""And the longer we wait and get close to default, the greater the risk to Social Security benefits being held up and delayed, or not paid in full."" "
China says Tesla to fix software for 1.1 million vehicles with braking issue,Reuters,"May 12, 2023, 8:23 PM UTC",Autos,"China’s market regulator said Tesla Inc. will fix software in more than 1 million vehicles to reduce the chance of accidents, the regulator said on Friday. The action is described as a product recall under Chinese regulations, the regulator said, but it was not immediately clear if drivers might need, or would be eligible, to return vehicles to Tesla for refunds. From May 29, the U.S. automaker will issue over-the-air software updates to 1.1 million units of its Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y cars, both imported and China-made, the State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement. The regulator said the vehicles concerned did not allow drivers to turn off regenerative braking or provide enough warnings when drivers stepped on the accelerator pedal hard, which, combined, could increase the risk of collision. The update will restore the option of switching off regenerative braking and warn drivers when they step hard on the accelerator pedal, it added. Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Regenerative braking works to save energy from the process of slowing a car, feeding the surplus to batteries to increase its driving range. Tesla had disabled the option to switch off the technique on cars produced after 2020. Some consumers in China welcomed the technology, also known as one-pedal driving, as it enabled them to bring a vehicle to a complete halt without use of the brake pedal. However, others complained it could confuse drivers and increase the risks of misstepping on accelerators. Chinese police have been investigating a crash involving a Model Y car in which a motorcyclist and a high school girl died and three people were injured when the driver lost control of the vehicle last November. At the time, Tesla said videos showed the car’s brake lights were not on while it was speeding and data showed issues such as there being no action to step on the brakes throughout its journey.

McDonald’s found liable for hot Chicken McNugget that fell from Happy Meal and burned girl,The Associated Press,"May 12, 2023, 4:12 PM UTC",U.S. news,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — McDonald’s and a franchise holder are at fault after a hot Chicken McNugget from a Happy Meal fell on a little girl’s leg and caused second-degree burns, a jury in South Florida has found. A second jury will determine how much McDonald’s USA and its franchise owner, Upchurch Foods, will pay the child and her mother, NBC Miami reported. Thursday’s decision was split, with jurors finding the franchise holder liable for negligence and failure to warn customers about the risk of hot food, and McDonald’s USA liable for failing to provide instructions for safe handling of the food. McDonald’s USA was not found to be negligent, and the jury dismissed the argument that the product was defective. “This was an unfortunate incident, but we respectfully disagree with the verdict,” McDonald’s USA said in a statement. “Our customers should continue to rely on McDonald’s to follow policies and procedures for serving Chicken McNuggets safely.” The jury heard two days of testimony and arguments about the 2019 episode that left the 4-year-old girl with a burned upper thigh before finding McDonald’s to blame. Philana Holmes testified that she bought Happy Meals for her son and daughter at a drive-thru window at a McDonald’s in Tamarac, near Fort Lauderdale, the South Florida SunSentinel reported. She said she handed the food to her children, who were in the back seat. After she drove away, her daughter started screaming. The mother testified she didn’t know what was wrong until she pulled over to help the girl, identified in court as Olivia, the newspaper reported. She saw the burn on the girl’s leg and took photos on her iPhone, which included audio clips of the child’s screams. The sound of the girl’s screams were played in court. The child, who is autistic, did not testify, the newspaper reported. Lawyers for McDonald’s noted that the food had to be hot to avoid salmonella poisoning, and that the nuggets were not meant to be pressed between a seat belt and human flesh for more than two minutes. The girl’s parents sued, saying that McDonald’s and the franchise owner failed to adequately train employees, failed to warn customers about the “dangerous” temperature of the food, and for cooking the food to a much higher temperature than necessary. While both sides agreed the nugget caused the burns, the family’s lawyers argued the temperature was above 200 degrees, while the defense said it was no more than 160 degrees. This isn't the first time McDonald's has been sued by customers over burns they say were caused by items on the fast-food restaurant's menu. In a well-known case from the early 1990s, Stella Liebeck, 79, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, sued McDonald’s over hot coffee that spilled on her lap in the car. She received significant injuries requiring hospitalization and skin grafts. Following a trial, the jury found Liebeck only 20% at fault, and she was awarded $160,000 in compensatory damages and $2.7 million in punitive damages. "
"Covid transformed the U.S. labor market, and it isn’t done yet",J.J. McCorvey,"May 11, 2023, 9:00 PM UTC / Updated May 12, 2023, 3:14 PM UTC",Economy,"After a three-year national health emergency, over 1.1 million Covid deaths, a wave of retirements and high inflation, the U.S. labor force is smaller and tighter than before the pandemic. For workers, that means continued leverage to secure pay gains and better conditions even as the economy cools. The labor market rebounded sharply from the blow dealt by Covid-19 as it swept the country in early 2020, thanks to aggressive federal relief measures and widespread vaccine rollouts. But the health crisis transformed the economy in ways that have persisted throughout the recovery, and analysts expect its ripple effects to linger despite a hiring slowdown and simmering recession fears. When the world shut down in March 2020, low-wage workers in hospitality and other service roles saw some of the steepest job losses amid the sharpest drop in employment post-WWII, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) study in March. While some parts of the economy have rebounded beyond pre-pandemic metrics, employers in many industries are still contending with staffing challenges. Spending is back, demand for labor is back, but we have a smaller labor force. — Wendy Edelberg, the brookings institution “Spending is back, demand for labor is back, but we have a smaller labor force,” said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “That is one of the reasons why the labor market feels tight and why firms have been reporting left, right and center that they’re having a hard time finding workers.” The U.S. population is 1.4 million people shy of pre-pandemic projections based on its growth rate before Covid hit, according to an April Brookings analysis of federal data. About 900,000 of those “missing” people would have been expected to be working. Edelberg attributed roughly 650,000 of those absences to deaths (Covid-related or otherwise) and the remaining 250,000 to immigration policies during the pandemic — particularly Title 42, a Trump administration measure that expired Thursday night along with the federal public health emergency. Many of the nation’s workers continue to suffer from health effects incurred during the pandemic. A January report by the New York State Insurer’s Fund, the state’s largest workers’ compensation carrier, found that during the first two years of the pandemic, 71% of patients with “long Covid” symptoms required ongoing medical treatment or didn’t return to work for six months or longer. A report from the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co., also from January, estimated that the economy lost 315 million to more than 1 billion working days among U.S. employees because of Covid last year alone, equivalent to 1.3 million to 4.3 million people’s leaving the workforce. “At the high end, that’s about double the average number of sick days taken by US workers in the decade before the pandemic,” the researchers wrote. A key reason the labor market remains so tight is that the pandemic collided with an already aging U.S. population. Some older workers bowed out of the workforce earlier than planned as employers slashed jobs and furloughed staff. As the subsequent recovery kicked off a hiring spree, many recent retirees came back off the sidelines, but others stayed put. A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York flagged a 2.1 million worker “participation gap,” which it largely attributed to the aging of the massive baby boomer population and a surge in retirements. While job growth is finally cooling down and layoffs have been piling up for months, many employers remain hungry to hire. Government data showed 9.6 million job openings in March, coming down from last year’s levels but still much higher than the roughly 7 million openings posted before the pandemic — in what was already a hot market at the time. Last month the U.S. added 253,000 roles, continuing a lengthy run of job gains that have been a boon to workers, with many taking part in the so-called Great Resignation to seek out better opportunities and work-life balance, or even entirely new careers during the economic recovery. Others have reaped rewards by sticking around, as bosses add incentives to retain staffers. Wage growth at the bottom is really making the labor market more equal. — Arindrajit Dube, UMass Amherst “We’ve had this huge imbalance between demand for employees and supply of employees for the last couple of years,” said Paige Ouimet, a finance professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “It’s slowly starting to shift,” she said, “but it is still a different situation in terms of the bargaining power that employees have relative to their employers.” An NBER study from March found that wage gains among the lowest-paid workers have substantially slowed the growth of income inequality. Arindrajit Dube, a study co-author and economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said the scale of low earners’ pay gains was striking — rising 6% from January 2020 to September 2022. “Wage growth at the bottom is really making the labor market more equal,” Dube said. Lower-wage workers have been pulling in more income “because they’ve been able to leave, because they’ve been able to find better jobs,” he said. The trend has fanned a pandemic-era surge in labor organizing efforts, including at name brands such as Starbucks and Amazon, as workers test their leverage. There are also signs that the tight competition for workers is increasing labor participation among certain groups. According to Brookings, women ages 25-54 boosted their labor force participation by 1.5 percentage points since 2019, and Black people aged 25-64 did so by 1.7 percentage points over the same period. Some demographics, however, are seeing the opposite trend. “White men of all ages and older white women are participating less” in the workforce, the Brookings researchers wrote. Labor force participation among white men ages 20 and older stood at 70.1% in April, down from 71% in March 2020. The 23% labor force participation rate among people with disabilities is up from 20.7% in 2019, according to federal employment data. The uptick reflects the many disabled workers who have entered the workforce during the job boom — as well as the increase in people working with long Covid. Remote and flexible work arrangements have made many jobs more accessible to those with disabilities. Government data showed 27.5% of private employers allowing full- or part-time telework as of last fall, the latest data available. “I’m very confident that the ability to work remotely will continue to affect who works and who doesn’t,” said Edelberg of Brookings. “Those effects are not fully settled down in the data. That’s with us for a long time.” "
California law on the humane raising of pigs survives Supreme Court challenge,Lawrence Hurley,"May 11, 2023, 2:13 PM UTC / Updated May 12, 2023, 2:58 PM UTC",Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a challenge to a California animal welfare law that would ban the sale of pork derived from breeding pigs housed in confined spaces. In a fractured ruling that divided the court along nonideological lines, the majority said the measure, known as Proposition 12, did not unlawfully regulate pork produced in other states, as the challengers claimed. The law is on hold as part of separate litigation in state court. Five justices wrote their own opinions, showing that there was considerable dissension over what legal rationale to adopt. While five justices said the lawsuit should be dismissed, four said it should have been allowed to move forward. The ruling, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, protects the authority of states to enact laws to protect the health and welfare of the public even if the measures have impacts out of state. Groups that back California had warned that a broad ruling against it could limit states’ authority to enact laws about a wide variety of issues, including measures to address climate change, such as by efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by promoting renewable energy. ""While the Constitution addresses many weighty issues, the type of pork chops California merchants may sell is not on that list,"" Gorsuch said. While it is long established that states cannot use their laws to discriminate against out-of-state interests, the California law is focused on regulating the sale of pork within its own borders, he said. Scott Hays, the president of the National Pork Producers Council, which challenged the measure, said in a statement: ""We are very disappointed with the Supreme Court’s opinion. Allowing state overreach will increase prices for consumers and drive small farms out of business, leading to more consolidation."" Californians approved Proposition 12 in 2018 with nearly 63% of the vote, a margin of more than 3 million votes. The measure would require that sows have at least 24 square feet of space in their enclosures, allowing them to turn around. The state’s lawyers pointed out in court papers that voters were told the measure, which is not in effect, would most likely increase the price of pork but provide for more humane living conditions for pigs and potentially reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses. The National Pork Producers Council, which represents the pork industry, and the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents farming interests, sued in 2019, saying the measure violates a provision of the Constitution called the commerce clause, which has been interpreted to bar states from interfering with interstate commerce. The challengers said the measure would impermissibly interfere with interstate commerce in part because almost all of the pork sold in California is produced out of state by farmers who would not currently be in compliance. The law would also impose an excessive burden on out-of-state entities without having a clear in-state benefit, they argue. As a result, they say, the law has an unlawfully broad extraterritorial effect. Lower courts upheld the measure, prompting the challengers to turn to the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. Gorsuch was joined in the majority by fellow conservatives Clarence Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett and liberals Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. In dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts said he would have revived the lawsuit because the challengers ""have plausibly alleged a substantial burden against interstate commerce."" Conservative justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh also dissented, as did liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Other states have passed similar laws based on moral concerns, including nine that ban products tested on animals and eight that ban eggs produced by caged hens, lawyers for the Humane Society of the United States have pointed out. Nine states also ban sales of fetal tissue from aborted fetuses, according to court filings. The groups challenging the California law said in court papers that Proposition 12 “will transform the pork industry nationwide” because currently nearly all farmers keep sows in pens that do not comply with the law. That view was contested by California and its allies, including meat producer Perdue Premium Meat Co., which filed a brief saying its Niman Ranch brand has for years been raising hogs that would have been in compliance with Proposition 12’s requirements. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, in charge of defending the law, said in court papers that the measure was valid under the commerce clause because it was not aimed at benefiting California producers over out-of-state competitors. In a statement Thursday, Bonta said the ruling “means that California can continue to have in place humane and commonsense standards, instead of the extreme confinement pushed by some pork producers.” He added that the Supreme Court affirmed “states’ important role in regulating goods sold within their borders.” The Biden administration backed the challengers, with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar saying Proposition 12 unreasonably restricts interstate commerce in part because it regulates the welfare of animals that are not inside the state’s borders. The stated benefits also fail to justify the sweeping nature of the law because its health benefits have not been established, she argued. "
"Texas lesbian bar denied insurance for hosting drag shows, owner says",Brooke Sopelsa,"May 11, 2023, 6:01 PM UTC / Updated May 12, 2023, 1:09 PM UTC",OUT News,"The owner of Houston’s only lesbian bar says her business is in jeopardy after it was denied insurance coverage, and she’s putting the blame, in part, on an anti-drag bill moving through the Texas Legislature. “They outright denied us, the underwriters, because we host drag shows,” Julie Mabry, the owner of Pearl Bar, said in an interview with NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston. Mabry has insurance through December, but she decided to switch agents a few months ago and shop around for a new policy, she told KPRC. It was during that process that her agent received the denial email, which the agent then sent to Mabry. “This is the first time I’ve ever gotten an email like that. I cried about this for about a week,” said Mabry, who told KPRC that drag shows were the first thing mentioned in the email, which outlined why the underwriter did not want to take on the risk of insuring her bar. Mabry did not share additional details about the underwriter or the email, and she did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. Mabry, who opened Pearl Bar in 2013, said the current political climate fueled the situation she’s in, and she encouraged followers of the Pearl Bar Instagram account to contact their legislators about anti-LGBTQ bills in the state, including one that would restrict drag shows on public property, on the premises of a commercial enterprise or in the presence of a child. The bill, Senate Bill 12, passed in the Texas Senate last month by a vote of 20-11, and it was set to be considered by a House committee Thursday. If the measure is signed into law, violators could be subjected to civil penalties of up to $10,000. “Pearl needs everyone to speak up for us so that we can stay open and HOST DRAG SHOWS! It’s THAT serious,” a post on the Pearl Bar Instagram account said. “We are in the final stretch of session and every voice counts in pushing back on this and the other anti-LGBTQ legislation. We need you to step up, be loud, and tell your legislators NO to any anti-LGBTQ+ bills. Our state should be open to all, period.” State Sen. Bryan Hughes, the bill’s author, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brad Pritchett, a Houston resident and the field director for LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Texas, noted that drag shows are still legal in Texas and said Pearl Bar's situation is a result of the ""fear and panic that lawmakers have stirred up"" around the centuries-old art form. ""This situation highlights one of the most insidious consequences of all the anti-LGBTQ+ bills in the legislature this session—most people don’t know what’s going on,"" he said in an email. ""It’s ludicrous to think that lawmakers can shut down an entire industry without even changing the law. Texans, we need you to show up to the capitol, to email your legislators, and to make a lot of noise about what is happening in Texas.” Texas is one of at least 16 states where legislators have proposed bills this year seeking to restrict the audiences for drag performances and where they can take place. Tennessee is the only state to have enacted such a law, which a federal judge temporarily blocked from taking effect. Bills seeking to restrict drag shows are part of a larger trend of Republican-led bills targeting LGBTQ people in the U.S. So far this year, more than 470 such bills have been proposed in legislatures across the U.S., according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Pearl Bar is one of about two dozen lesbian bars left in the U.S. and one of only two in Texas, the other being Sue Ellen’s in Dallas. Mabry hopes Texas will not be left with just a lone lesbian bar. “This situation is real,” she wrote on Instagram. “I’ve tried to be as careful as I can to keep my patrons, performers, and staff safe, but if we stay quiet, we aren’t helping.” "
Debt ceiling meeting between Biden and congressional leaders is delayed,Peter Alexander,"May 11, 2023, 8:34 PM UTC / Updated May 11, 2023, 9:29 PM UTC",Debt ceiling crisis,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden's meeting with the top four leaders in Congress planned for Friday has been postponed until next week, three sources said. “Staff will continue working, and all the principals agreed to meet early next week,"" a White House spokesperson said. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said that all parties agreed to the postponement and that it should not be read as a sign that talks are falling apart. ""We are going to meet again,"" he said, adding that the group believes it will be most productive to ""let the staff meet again tomorrow.” A source familiar with the meetings said: “This is a positive development. Meetings are progressing. Staff is continuing to meet, and it wasn’t the right moment to bring it back to principals.” Congressional leaders met at the White House on Tuesday in a meeting that was described as ""tense and serious"" by a source in the room and did not result in a deal. Staff members for congressional leadership and the White House have been meeting daily since then, including a two-hour meeting Thursday in the Capitol basement that was attended by Louisa Terrell, Biden's top legislative aide. Recent meetings and staff-level White House talks with the divided Congress have yielded few public signs of a breakthrough to avoid a default that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned could come as early as June 1. But some saw the postponement as a small, positive development. The delay allows the staff group to be able to make more progress — however ""notional"" — and the principal negotiators to make bigger moves next week, an aide familiar with the talks said. Another source familiar with the discussions said there have been good and productive conversations among staffers. Those in the room felt having a few more days to talk at the staff level would be helpful, so they decided to move the leaders' meeting to early next week. Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., remain adamant that the threat of default, which would be catastrophic for the U.S. economy, be taken off the table and that any negotiations be left to talks over the federal budget. McCarthy, meanwhile, is not budging on his refusal to extend the debt limit without conditions, demanding spending cuts. He has the support of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., even as both Republican leaders say they do not want to see the country default. House Rules Committee Chair Tom Cole, R-Okla., said he hopes the delay means the White House is changing course. “I hope it means they’re reconsidering their ridiculous strategy of saying we have to have a clean debt limit because they can’t get one through either house,” Cole said. “So hopefully this means the White House is finally serious about addressing the debt crisis.” A wild card in the already tense standoff is former President Donald Trump, the de facto leader of the Republican Party, who poured fuel on the fire this week by egging on an unprecedented default unless Democrats surrender to GOP policy demands and slash spending in a CNN town hall.

Peloton recalls 2.2 million exercise bikes over safety hazard,Rob Wile,"May 11, 2023, 2:00 PM UTC",Consumer,"Peloton is recalling 2 million exercise bicycles over safety concerns, the second major recall the fitness company has faced. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a release Thursday that the bikes' seat posts can break during use, posing fall and injury hazards to users. Peloton has already received 35 reports of the seat post breaking and detaching from the bike during use, the CPSC said, including 13 reports of injuries that include a fractured wrist, lacerations and bruises. ""Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled exercise bikes and contact Peloton for a free repair,"" the release said. ""Peloton is offering consumers a free seat post that can be self-installed."" This is not the first time Peloton has faced a widespread recall. In May 2021, it was forced to recall 125,000 of its Tread+ treadmills after a child's death and other problems involving the machines. Peloton's stock was down more than 7% following Thursday's announcement. "
Dwindling immigration puts squeeze on home building,Jasmine Cui,"May 11, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",Data Graphics,"New home construction is key to unlocking lower housing prices. But the rate of this type of construction has fallen month to month since March 2022, and experts say tough immigration policies that have shrunk the construction workforce are behind the building squeeze. Nationally, foreign-born people make up 30% of construction workers, data from the Census Bureau shows, making immigrants a key part of the home building puzzle. But against a backdrop of tightened immigration policies instituted during the Trump administration and exacerbated during the pandemic, the number of foreign workers entering the construction industry has almost fallen in half. There were more than 67,000 new workers in 2016, compared to 38,900 in 2020. The lack of immigrant workers has led to a construction shortage, even as supply-chain stoppages and material costs have eased. NBC News compared Census Bureau data on the immigrant construction worker population in each state with a 2022 report on home underproduction by affordable housing nonprofit Up for Growth and found a strong relationship between foreign workforces and slowed home building. Specifically, for each additional 1% increase in immigrant worker share, there was a predicted corresponding increase of 6,563 in the gap between built housing units and demand for units. “I can’t say how many times our members have said, ‘We’d bid on more work, we’d be doing more projects if we had more people to do the construction,’” said Brian Turmail, vice president of public affairs at Associated General Contractors of America, which represents home builders across the country. While immigrants are employed in many sectors, certain fields lean more heavily on immigrant labor. This means that tighter immigration policies have an outsize effect in certain areas. Lower immigration was a policy goal of the Trump White House, and the administration issued several policies toward that goal from 2017 to 2021, including freezing visas. The administration also took several hard stances toward undocumented immigrants, issuing executive orders for a wall along the southern border, deploying additional Border Patrol agents, and instituting the Migrant Protection Protocols, which forced asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico while waiting for hearings. The number of new immigrant workers entering the construction industry dropped by a third in 2017 — Donald Trump’s first year in office — the first such decline in six years. And more than 2 million fewer immigrants than expected entered the labor force from March 2020 to late 2021, according to estimates from researchers Giovanni Peri and Reem Zaiour of the University of California, Davis. Many builders said the labor strain that began in 2017 has persisted. “As I sit here, there’s two projects that are stagnant yesterday and today because there aren’t enough [workers] for the crews to send guys there,” said Joshua Correa, a Dallas home builder. “How it was a long time ago, we didn’t have to wait — you would call and they would say, ‘We’ll be there tomorrow.’ Now it’s a month or six weeks.” If foreign-born workers aren’t available, experts say there aren’t enough U.S.-born workers to fill in the gap. “These [immigrant] workers are not substitutable,” said Michael Clemens, an economics professor at George Mason University. Clemens has studied the effect of immigrant labor in the workforce, and his findings refute the argument that immigrants take jobs that would otherwise be filled by U.S.-born workers. Instead, Clemens has found there’s no decrease in hiring of comparable U.S. workers, and, on average, firms that are unable to access low-skill immigrant labor slash profits 17%. “Even when employers find a few [U.S.-born workers] to fill these jobs, they find there’s extremely high turnover in them,” Clemens said. Immigrants, Clemens said, offer the kind of labor supply that employers in construction need to plan business activity medium- to long-term. For consumers, that worker shortage means higher prices. Home prices, while down slightly from summer 2022 highs, are still above pre-pandemic levels. And with housing inventory in March 2023 sitting around 560,000 available units — roughly half of pre-pandemic numbers — experts don’t expect any immediate improvement. “I’ve had to increase prices $75,000 across all of our standard builds,” Correa said, citing the need to compete with neighboring firms for workers. “If nothing changes, this will only get worse.” "
Blinded by the light: Cars in the U.S. still lack glare-reducing headlights,Adiel Kaplan,"May 11, 2023, 11:41 AM UTC",U.S. news,"One night in early November, Aaron Madrid was driving home from his job at a haunted house outside Chicago when he faced an unexpected horror. The lights from an oncoming pickup truck hit him dead in the eyes, blinding him. “I was completely disoriented and couldn’t see for five to 10 seconds,” the 22-year-old said. “I didn’t realize I had swerved into the oncoming traffic lane. By the time I regained my eyesight, I had already hit the curb and then I hit a tree.” Madrid’s Chevy Sonic was totaled, but he was lucky, stumbling out of the vehicle without major injury, just some bruising where the airbags had hit his thighs. “It was traumatic. I didn’t know what happened to me till my car had stopped.” It’s nearly impossible to know how often headlight glare causes crashes like Madrid’s, according to automotive safety experts. But improving lighting to help prevent nighttime crashes — which have a fatality rate three times higher than daytime collisions — has been a priority for U.S. automakers, safety advocates and regulators for more than a decade. Yet Americans today may face more headlight glare and less effective headlights than drivers in other countries. “The United States is decades behind the rest of the developed world with respect to updating standards to keep up with technologies, particularly in the headlight area,” said Greg Brannon, AAA’s director of automotive engineering and industry relations. “The standards have not been substantively updated since the ‘70s. Meanwhile, technology has marched on.” Better road illumination and less glare from oncoming traffic are both key for safer night driving, automotive safety experts say. Technology that can do both at once — known as adaptive driving beams — has been used in Europe since 2012, according to automakers, and today it is available in cars sold in every major automotive market worldwide, except the U.S. "
Former DHS disinformation expert sues Fox News alleging defamation,Daniel Arkin,"May 11, 2023, 1:41 AM UTC",U.S. news,"An expert who once oversaw a Department of Homeland Security disinformation board filed a defamation suit Wednesday against Fox News, her lawyer said. Nina Jankowicz said in the suit, filed in Delaware state court, that she was subjected to violent threats because of Fox News’ portrayal of her and her role, which included insults made on the network. “Fox’s coverage of Jankowicz was neither news nor political commentary; it was cheap, easy entertainment untethered from the facts, designed to make consumers believe that Jankowicz could and would suppress their speech,” her attorneys wrote in the suit. “Fox chose to lie about Jankowicz deliberately.” Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Jankowicz, an author and an expert in disinformation, was appointed executive director of DHS board, which was created in late April 2022. It was an internal working group within the agency with no authority, the suit says. The board's work was paused just weeks later, on May 18, and Jankowicz resigned. She said at the time that the board’s purpose was to ensure that DHS followed best practices in combatting disinformation while protecting Americans’ freedom of speech, privacy and civil liberties. Comments on Fox News portrayed her as censoring Americans' speech, the suit argues. She was called ""unhinged” and a ""Minister of Truth"" in an apparent reference to George Orwell's dystopian world in ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" the suit says. The lawsuit included screenshots of comments on Gab and another website, Patriots.win, in which people reacted to Fox broadcasts with comments like “time to kill them all.” Tweets said she should be executed. Other direct messages told Jankowicz to kill herself using vulgar language, according to the lawsuit. Her address was also released online, and members of her family were threatened, the suit alleges. The lawsuit alleges defamation and seeks compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages; the amounts are not spelled out. The coverage created a ""completely false reputation concerning government censorship,"" the suit alleges. ""In other words, based on verifiable falsehoods, Fox has made Jankowicz radioactive and deterred others from working with her as they otherwise would,"" lawyers argue in the suit. Fox agreed last month to pay $787.5 million to settle a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems over lies spread on the network about the 2020 election. A defamation lawsuit Smartmatic, an electronics equipment company, filed against Fox News is pending. Smartmatic's suit seeks $2.7 billion. A Fox spokesperson last month cited freedom of the press and said Fox was confident it will prevail in the Smartmatic case. "
"Hulu content to be added to Disney+ for 'one-app experience,' CEO Bob Iger says",Daniel Arkin,"May 10, 2023, 10:23 PM UTC",News,"Disney is bringing its marquee streaming services closer together. The Walt Disney Co. plans to combine content from Hulu and Disney+ into a ""one-app experience"" by the end of the year, CEO Bob Iger announced on the entertainment giant's quarterly earnings call Wednesday. Iger said Hulu and Disney+, as well as the ESPN+ platform, will continue to be available as standalone services. North American consumers can currently subscribe to a package that bundles the three platforms together at a discounted rate. In his opening remarks, Iger called the move ""a logical progression of our DTC [direct-to-consumer] offerings that will provide greater opportunities for advertisers, while giving bundle subscribers access to more robust and streamlined content, resulting in greater audience engagement and ultimately leading to a more unified streaming experience."" The announcement comes after months of speculation over the future of Hulu. In recent months, analysts have wondered whether Iger planned to sell Hulu, which offers a mix of adult-oriented original content and older titles drawn from Disney’s film and TV library, including assets it acquired in 2019 from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox studio. Asked for his views on the fate of Hulu in an appearance on CNBC in February, Iger said, ""Everything is on the table right now, so I am not going to speculate whether we are a buyer or a seller of it."" Disney has a roughly 67% stake in Hulu. The remaining 33% is controlled by Comcast, the corporation that owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. The two corporations have an agreement under which, starting in January, Comcast can require Disney to buy its stake or Disney can force Comcast to sell its stake. Disney did not immediately respond to an email asking whether it would raise prices for Disney+ and how it would differentiate between kid-friendly and adult-oriented programming on the combined app. Hulu has grown in stature in recent years with acclaimed original programming such as ""Only Murders in the Building"" and ""The Dropout,"" an eight-part miniseries about Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. But with roughly 48 million subscribers in North America and virtually no international presence, Hulu lags behind more dominant streaming players, such as Netflix. Disney+ has 157.8 million global subscribers, the company announced on the earnings call — a substantial number but 4 million less than it had at the end of last year. "
Tarte Cosmetics CEO pledges to make creator program more equitable and inclusive,Daysia Tolentino,"May 10, 2023, 5:34 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Tarte Cosmetics CEO Maureen Kelly posted a TikTok video Tuesday in which she pledged to make the company's creator program more inclusive after criticism online over the brand's treatment of a Black influencer. ""As the founder and CEO of Tarte, I acknowledge that we have fallen short in matters of diversity, inclusion and equity in the past,"" Kelly said in the video. Kelly said that the company would be reviewing its creator program to make sure it is inclusive and equitable. She added that Tarte would update the program regularly to ""reflect changes in the beauty influencer market"" and would take immediate action to address any inequality issues in its program. ""We're also going to be more transparent about how we work with our creators, including how we choose them,"" she said in the video. ""I think that's not only going to just help the creators but trust amongst, like, the industry as a whole."" In an email to NBC News, Kelly said that Tarte is taking immediate steps to hire a diversity, equity and inclusion specialist as well as establish a creator advisory group to provide the brand with feedback. She also said the cosmetics company would be updating its guidelines to ensure creators are treated equally regardless of background. ""The goal of these initiatives is not to make a problem go away, but rather to start conversations that can lead to a better solution,"" Kelly said. ""I want to express my gratitude to those who shared their feedback and comments online. I want to assure you that I took it to heart. Your input has helped me grasp the more significant problem, and work with my team to make sure we rectify the situation immediately to start the process of regaining your confidence in Tarte."" The goal of these initiatives is not to make a problem go away, but rather to start conversations that can lead to a better solution — Tarte Cosmetics CEO Maureen Kelly The most recent backlash against Tarte began after influencer Bria Jones posted a now-deleted TikTok video last Thursday. In her video, Jones shared that she was backing out of the Tarte trip to Miami for the Grand Prix, which was held this past weekend, because she felt she was being treated differently than other influencers going on the trip. ""I would love to go on a Tarte trip and trust me, I'm so grateful,"" Jones said in the video. ""But I have more integrity than to get all the way to Miami and realize I'm being treated like a second-tier person."" Jones said her flight home from Miami was scheduled on May 6, despite the race taking place on May 7. In contrast, she said, her friends were all invited to watch the race and were scheduled to leave on May 8. ""I've worked too hard to get to where I am today and I will be damned as a Black creator if I accept anything other than equal treatment on these trips,"" she said in the video. Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She later made another TikTok video saying the incident was a result of ""miscommunication on both ends."" ""Tarte has done a great job of working through the situation with me,"" she said in the video. Many viewers felt that Kelly's initial response to the concerns brought up in Jones' video was dismissive. Kelly had made a video in which she put on makeup and curled her hair while explaining the decisions that went into the Miami trip. ""I chose a lighthearted approach to a topic that deserved a serious response,"" Kelly said in an email. ""Even worse, I failed to directly address the unequal treatment of Black creators within beauty creator programs. First and foremost, I want to apologize again — publicly this time — to the creator who brought attention to this issue and anyone else who has been affected."" Under Kelly's TikTok post Tuesday, commenters pointed out that the brand has made similar promises in the past. ""Didn’t you say the same thing in 2018… 2020… 2021?"" one commenter wrote. ""Didn’t tarte do the same thing years ago and claim to hire a DEI person then? Sounds like effective changes weren’t made,"" another wrote. ""tarte made promises in writing like this YEARS ago…and nothing changed. why is this any different?"" one person wrote. In January 2018, Tarte apologized after consumers called out its lack of shades for darker skin tones in its rollout of ""Shape Tape"" foundation. Of the 15 shades included in the product's launch, only three were catered to deeper skin tones. In June 2020, Tarte revealed that its team was 6% Black and its leadership was 5% Black. The company pledged to increase Black representation at the corporate and leadership level at the time and promised to ""do better."" "
Paramount brands to lay off 25% of U.S. staff as MTV News shuts down,Variety,"May 10, 2023, 4:58 PM UTC",Business News,"Layoffs will be hitting 25% of employees across the Showtime, MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks groups in the U.S. Tuesday, following months of internal deliberations about integration amid Showtime’s rebranding into Paramount+ With Showtime. Additionally, MTV News — which was significantly affected by layoffs more than five years ago — will be shutting down. Other units, most of which are operations, will be shuttered as well. In a memo to staff, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks president Chris McCarthy said that, despite Paramount’s “success in streaming, we continue to feel pressure from broader economic headwinds like many of our peers,” and that “senior leaders in coordination with HR have been working together over the past few months to determine the optimal organization for the current and future needs of our business.” “As a result, we have made the very hard but necessary decision to reduce our domestic team by approximately 25%,” McCarthy said. “This is a tough yet important strategic realignment of our group. Through the elimination of some units and by streamlining others, we will be able to reduce costs and create a more effective approach to our business as we move forward. Today we will notify employees whose positions are being impacted with leaders communicating the news directly to those teams/or individuals. These meetings will be followed by individual 1:1s with our HR partners.” McCarthy’s group will be consolidated into “two functions”: Studios, encompassing Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios; and networks, “combining nine separate teams into one portfolio group.” The affected Paramount-owned networks include Nick, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, CMT, Smithsonian, TV Land, Logo and Pop TV. The majority of the layoffs will be among the networks group due to consolidation. These cuts come four months after Showtime laid off 120 employees while merging into MTV Entertainment Studios as part of the overall Paramount+ With Showtime strategy, just as Showtime co-presidents Gary Levine and Jana Winograde exited their posts. See McCarthy’s note to staff in full below. Team, As we finalize the integration of SHOWTIME and continue to transform our business for the future, we have set a great foundation for continued success by consolidating our group into two functions: • Studios — integrating SHOWTIME and MTV Entertainment Studios into one powerful studio team • Networks — combining nine separate teams into one portfolio group This combination has resulted in an incredible track record of hits including Yellowstone, 1883, Tulsa King, South Park, The Challenge, Teen Wolf, 1923, Drag Race, Mayor of Kingstown, Your Honor, George & Tammy and Yellowjackets — which, taken together, drove record subscribers across Paramount+ and Showtime and helped Paramount+ lead the industry in new subscriber growth. However, despite this success in streaming, we continue to feel pressure from broader economic headwinds like many of our peers. To address this, our senior leaders in coordination with HR have been working together over the past few months to determine the optimal organization for the current and future needs of our business. As a result, we have made the very hard but necessary decision to reduce our domestic team by approximately 25%. This is a tough yet important strategic realignment of our group. Through the elimination of some units and by streamlining others, we will be able to reduce costs and create a more effective approach to our business as we move forward.

HSBC downgrades Anheuser-Busch InBev as it deals with a 'Bud Light crisis',"Sarah Min, CNBC","May 10, 2023, 4:58 PM UTC",Business News,"It’s time to step to the sidelines on Anheuser-Busch InBev as it deals with a “Bud Light crisis,” according to HSBC. Analyst Carlos Laboy downgraded the beverage stock to hold, saying there are “deeper problems than ABI admits” after a recent social media partnership in April between the Bud Light brand and Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer, resulted in a wave of backlash that included boycotts of the beer. Meanwhile, the marketing executive responsible for the partnership is reportedly taking a leave of absence. “Is ABI’s leadership getting the brand culture transformation right? It’s mixed,” Laboy wrote in a Wednesday note. “At Ambev, we think the answer is ‘yes;’ in the US, we think it’s ‘no.’ The way this Bud Light crisis came about a month ago, management’s response to it and the loss of unprecedented volume and brand relevance raises many questions.” Anheuser-Busch InBev reported a spike in profit for the first quarter, but the analyst cited a Beer Marketer’s Insights note that showed a steep drop in beer sales — of maybe more than 25% — in April. The Budweiser parent company, which also owns the brands Corona and Stella Artois, is up more than 5.7% this year. However, it’s down by more than 4.8% this quarter. Shares are down 1.3% in Wednesday premarket trading. “Why did its US leadership underestimate the risk of pushback given the recent experience of other firms? Is A-B hiring the best people to grow the brands and gauge risk?” Laboy wrote. “If Budweiser and Bud Light are iconic American ideas that have long brought consumers together, why did these marketers fail to invite new consumers without alienating the core base of the firm’s largest brand?” However, the analyst pointed out that some strength abroad is helping the stock. Anheuser-Busch InBev did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment. CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed to this report. "
Chicago gay bars boycott Anheuser-Busch for distancing itself from Dylan Mulvaney,Jay Valle,"May 10, 2023, 4:12 PM UTC",OUT News,"Beer drinkers visiting Chicago gay bars may have a difficult time finding popular brands like Bud Light, Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra. That’s because at least five LGBTQ venues in the city are boycotting the brewing company Anheuser-Busch and its products after the company distanced itself from transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Mulvaney, best known for her “Days of Girlhood” TikTok series, partnered with the company during the NCAA’s March Madness basketball tournament. The partnership, which consisted of a sponsored post on her Instagram account promoting Bud Light, spawned a right-wing backlash. The company’s response to that backlash led to accusations that it was abandoning Mulvaney, 25, which in turn ignited a response from the LGBTQ community. “We have simply removed their products,” Mark Robertson, the co-owner of Chicago-based 2Bears Tavern Group, told NBC News on Tuesday. “Our position is that we expect the products we sell to align their values with our values or not trample on the right of our customers. That’s where we believe Anheuser-Busch crossed the line.” Robertson, whose company owns four LGBTQ bars in Chicago, said the final straw came after Anheuser-Busch InBev’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday when, he said, company leadership further tried “to distance themselves from this whole situation.” When asked by an analyst about the Mulvaney partnership and how a seemingly small partnership turned into “something a whole lot bigger than that,” Anheuser-Busch InBev CEO Michael Doukeris said, in part: “We will need to continue to clarify the fact that this was one can, one influencer, one post, and not a campaign, and repeat this message for some time.” Robertson said, “They have chosen to side with a group of people who are being very hateful, who do not value, you know, the human rights or the lives of the LGBTQ community.” The right-wing backlash to the Mulvaney-Bud Light partnership was swift, especially across social media. Countless videos were shared online showing consumers dumping their Bud Light products in trash bins and down sinks — and even violently destroying cans of the beer. One particularly jarring response came in an Instagram video posted by the singer-songwriter Kid Rock, who can be seen shooting at cases of Bud Light with what appeared to be a semi-automatic rifle. Shortly after Thursday’s earnings call, Robertson announced on social media that “All 2Bears Tavern Group bars are discontinuing Anheuser-Busch InBev products as a result of the brewer’s anti-transgender actions and statements.” The group owns four LGBTQ bars in Chicago: 2Bears Tavern, Jackhammer, Meeting House Tavern and The SoFo Tap. Following 2Bears Tavern Group’s announcement, Sidetrack, a popular LGBTQ venue that has been in the city for over 40 years, announced it will also stop the sale of Anheuser-Busch products. When asked about the Chicago LGBTQ bars that are no longer selling the company’s products, a spokesperson for Anheuser-Busch InBev said in an emailed statement: “We remain committed to the programs and partnerships we have forged over decades with organizations to drive economic prosperity across a number of communities, including those in the LGBTQ+ community.” Robertson said he doesn’t anticipate selling Anheuser-Busch products at any of his bars again. “This is not about economic prosperity; this is about human rights,” he said. “You can’t, on the one hand, say we’re going to continue to put rainbows on our cans, and we’re going to continue to sponsor parades, while on the other hand, basically bending over to what is a lot of hate and vitriol.” HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, downgraded Anheuser-Busch InBev’s stock from a “buy” to a “hold” as the company deals with its “Bud Light crisis,” CNBC reported Wednesday.

Graphic: Track grocery price trends,Ben Popken,"April 15, 2021, 5:14 PM UTC / Updated May 10, 2023, 1:49 PM UTC",Business News,"Family grocery bills are on the rise with higher prices for most items, accentuated by a still-significant increase in the cost of eggs. But unless shoppers are taking notes, it can be hard to really see which items are seeing the biggest spikes. NBC News is monitoring the average point-of-sale prices and how much those prices have changed since April 2022 for six popular supermarket items: orange juice, eggs, chicken breasts, fresh ground beef, bacon and bread. Readers can use this interactive chart to see how the price they have paid for groceries differs from the national average or from the prices shoppers paid in other major metro areas.  The goal is to track the impact of inflation on consumers’ wallets during the pandemic and as the economy reopens. The White House has said inflation is on the rise and here to stay. The NBC News grocery price tracker is one measure of the outcomes of President Joe Biden's economic policies for everyday people. The Federal Reserve has said that prices have accelerated and that they are expected to keep rising. Input costs are up, especially for food and fuel, which pressures grocery prices. Supply chain disruptions and weather also play roles. The data in the NBC News tracker, provided by NielsenIQ, is collected from real checkout prices paid nationwide at grocery stores, drugstores, mass merchandisers, selected dollar stores, selected warehouse clubs and military commissaries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly consumer price index, which uses human data collectors and includes other food product categories, is another resource for average price data. This story will be updated monthly. "
Inflation in America: Track where prices are rising,Nigel Chiwaya,"June 16, 2022, 9:00 PM UTC / Updated May 10, 2023, 1:10 PM UTC",Data Graphics,"After having rocked U.S. consumers at levels not experienced in more than 40 years, inflation is starting to moderate. In April, consumer prices were 4.9% higher than the year before, down from a peak of 9% in summer 2022 and the lowest level in two years. NBC News is tracking inflation levels across a variety of consumer metrics. The chart below, which shows how prices each month compare to the same time a year earlier, will be updated monthly. "
Consumer price growth falls to below 5% for the first time in two years,Rob Wile,"May 9, 2023, 1:12 PM UTC / Updated May 10, 2023, 12:35 PM UTC",Economy,"Consumer prices climbed 4.9% in April — the first time annual inflation has landed below 5% in two years. On a monthly basis, the inflation rate rose 0.4%, which was higher than the 0.1% in March. The latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed other favorable trends: Food prices climbed just 7.7% over the 12-month period — the eighth-straight month of slower price growth. And on a monthly basis, food prices actually declined. Stock futures jumped following the report. Still, the ""core"" inflation reading for April, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 5.5% on the year. That was in line with economists' expectations. In a note to clients after the release of Wednesday morning's report, Seema Shah, chief global strategist with Principal Asset Management financial group, said the latest data showed earlier concerns about a ""hot"" inflation report for April proved ""unfounded."" She noted that a measure of prices within service categories now shows ""clear deceleration."" ""In light of the strong April jobs report, the [Federal Reserve] will be comforted by the number and it reinforces its policy slant towards a pause"" in interest rate hikes, she wrote. The Fed's stated goal of returning the economy to a 2% inflation rate is still in play. Despite the progress shown in Wednesday's report, there will likely be many more months before the central bank reaches that goal. ""We’re in a robust demand environment,” Neil Dutta, the head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research group, said in an interview. “And one reason for that is that labor markets are very tight” — meaning demand for workers exceeds the supply of available ones. Indeed, the most recent jobs data showed the unemployment rate fell back to its post-pandemic low of 3.4%. “We have an overheated economy,” Dutta said. Included with that ""tight"" labor market: ongoing wage increases. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows average hourly earnings have increased by 4.4% over the 12 months through April. It's good news on paper, but paying workers more money usually means employers will raise prices on goods and services, which ultimately gets passed down to consumers. Rising wages are one reason economists at Bank of America told clients last week they predict ongoing increases in the cost of dining out. Last week, the BLS reported leisure and hospitality earnings increased by 5.7% year over year for April. Grocery costs have also shown ongoing significant increases, as food companies like PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever said in their most recent earnings reports that they have continued to raise prices. Economists at Bank of America say more ""demand destruction"" is needed — meaning consumers pull back on their spending even after prices have fallen — to dramatically reduce inflation. That is all despite the Federal Reserve's having hiked its key federal funds rate for 10 straight meetings to the highest level in 16 years. By raising interest rates, the Fed hopes to make it more expensive to borrow and invest and thereby curb demand for goods and services. But the U.S. economy is a massive machine, so it takes time for those interest rate hikes to meaningfully slow things down. At his news conference last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn’t explicitly rule out additional rate hikes at the central bank's meetings this summer. Powell also tamped down any expectations of a rate cut this year, saying it is “not in our forecast.” One category is largely out of the Fed's control: gas prices. Thanks to a production cut by OPEC, they ticked higher last month. But the overall effect has been a persistently inflationary environment that continues to bedevil the economy. ""Unfortunately, it has been like watching the financial equivalent of a car wreck,"" Mark Hamrick, a Bankrate economic analyst, said in a note Monday. ""Between the spikes in gasoline, food and shelter prices, there has been no shortage of sources of aggravation associated with inflation for many months now. This tension is easing but hasn’t gone away.” Despite growing worries about the well-being of American households, recent data shows savings rates have increased for two straight quarters, while a survey Monday found consumers' perceptions about their current financial situations actually improved in April. That may translate into ongoing demand — and price increases. ""The job market and inflation continue to show an economy where demand outstrips supply and inflation is persistently elevated,"" Citigroup economists wrote in a note to clients Monday. Wednesday's inflation report, they said, is likely to ""call into question the extent to which underlying inflation has slowed."" "
Tempur Sealy is buying Mattress Firm for $4 billion,Reuters,"May 9, 2023, 8:52 PM UTC",Corporations,"Tempur Sealy International said on Tuesday it would buy retailer Mattress Firm in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $4 billion, as the leading U.S. bedding maker looks to stem a post-pandemic decline in sales. Mattress companies have struggled in recent quarters from an easing in demand following the explosive growth seen during the early months of the pandemic when consumers upgraded their home furnishings. Mattress Firm, part-owned by Steinhoff International Holdings NV, is among the biggest bedding retailers in the U.S., with more than 2,300 brick-and-mortar store locations. The deal would give the combined company a footprint of about 3,000 stores globally Earlier this year, Mattress Firm said it was continuing to explore all options for the business after withdrawing plans to go public. The companies, however, expect to close the deal only by the second half of 2024, with analysts anticipating a lengthy review by regulators. Tempur Sealy said it had received a request for additional information and documentary material from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Negotiations with the FTC are in the “early innings”, Tempur Sealy executives said in an earnings call. The firms also submitted a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing, or a pre-merger notification, with regulators back in October, given the uncertain regulatory environment. “In the current environment ... it has become difficult when you try to negotiate a deal as to understand how much FTC risk you have, because it’s different than what it has been historically,” Tempur Sealy CEO Scott Thompson told Reuters. “(The early filing helps) get a flavor of the initial reaction and make sure you understand where there might be issues.” The companies believe they can ultimately clear the process either traditionally or through litigation and said they were considering all options to ensure closing, including store divestitures. The merger agreement includes a $50 million break-up fee for FTC issues and a maximum store divestiture limit, Thompson said. "
"More Americans are so worried about money, it's hurting their mental health",Rob Wile,"May 9, 2023, 7:04 PM UTC",Consumer,"Worries about money are taking a toll on Americans, leading to some negative impacts on their mental health. That's according to a new survey from the financial information group Bankrate. The survey found 52% of respondents listed money as the thing that takes the biggest toll on their mental health, compared with 42% who blamed worries about their own health and 41% who listed current events as their top concern. The latest finding compares with 42% of U.S. adults who said money was their top concern last year. Mental health distress can manifest in many ways. For the Bankrate survey, that definition includes feelings of anxiety, stress, worried thoughts, difficulty sleeping and depression. The results come ahead of Wednesday’s inflation report, which is predicted to show year-on-year price increases stayed at 5% for the second consecutive month through April. Still, some analysts say the inflation rate is likely to come in ahead of that figure given recent increases in used car prices and ongoing wage hikes. That money-induced stress is also unfolding at a time when more American adults are confronting financial disaster, including upticks in car repossessions and home foreclosures. Within the ""money"" category in Bankrate's survey, concerns about inflation ranked the most stress-inducing, with 68% naming high prices as their biggest worry. As many as 60% of the people who responded said they were concerned about paying for everyday expenses, while 56% said lacking emergency funds has them on edge. ""There are several sobering statistics in this report ... with inflation at the center of many of these money worries,"" Ted Rossman, Bankrate senior industry analyst, said in the write-up of the survey. ""Despite a strong job market, wage growth has not kept pace with the rising cost of living. Debt has been rising and savings have been dwindling."" The frequency of concerns about money has also increased, with 56% of people with money concerns saying the worries happen at least once a week — up from 52% last year who said the same. And 29% of those who say money has a negative impact on their mental health say they worry about money daily, Bankrate said. The survey also found important demographic differences in the rates of concern, namely that 61% of women said inflation and rising prices had the biggest negative impact on their mental health, compared with 51% of men saying so. Overall, 73% of women named ""economic factors"" as the top driver affecting their own mental health, compared with 66% of men. And among generations, the survey found 60% of Gen Xers (ages 43 to 58) said money was negatively impacting their mental health, compared with 55% of millennials (ages 27 to 42), 52% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 26), and 45% of baby boomers (ages 59 to 77). Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, a financial therapist interviewed by Bankrate, said Gen X finds itself as the ""sandwich"" generation where they may be supporting multiple dependents. “They’re at this double whammy disadvantage of not just caring for themselves, but also often caring for children and their aging parents, and getting toward the later half of their earning years,” Bryan-Podvin said. “So of course, they’re experiencing higher rates of financial anxiety.” "
14th Amendment option on the debt ceiling would need to overcome DOJ concerns,Ryan J. Reilly,"May 9, 2023, 5:13 PM UTC / Updated May 9, 2023, 6:23 PM UTC",Justice Department,"WASHINGTON — More than a decade ago, when then-President Barack Obama was weighing what to do as the U.S. neared the debt ceiling, a small but critical office within the Justice Department weighed in with some key legal advice. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), sometimes referred to as ""the president's law firm,"" advised Obama on whether the 14th Amendment gave the president permission to unilaterally raise the borrowing limit of the United States, bypassing the problem. The amendment states that the “validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payments of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned."" But the office's opinions on the matter never became public. The still-secret views of an office that doles out legal advice to the executive branch may take on new relevance as President Joe Biden's administration faces another debt ceiling showdown. Responding to Freedom of Information Act requests — in 2011 and again in 2013 — OLC declined to make its written opinions on the 14th Amendment question public. In 2011, the office wrote that four relevant OLC documents were “protected by the deliberative process, the attorney client, and the presidential communications privileges.” In 2013, OLC said, there were five documents, also “protected by the deliberative process, attorney-client, and presidential communications privileges"" and none were ""appropriate for discretionary release.” A public list of OLC opinions includes a redacted entry from 2011 and a number of redacted entries from both 2012 and 2013. A spokeswoman for OLC declined to comment Tuesday. Ultimately, the Obama administration ruled the 14th Amendment out. Former White House spokesman Jay Carney, in late 2012, said the administration “does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the President the power to ignore the debt ceiling — period.” Obama, in early 2013, took it off the table. Biden — who was, of course, vice president during previous debt ceiling showdowns — told MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle last week that he had not ""gotten there yet"" on invoking the 14th Amendment. This week, in an interview with ABC News, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said invoking the 14th Amendment could spark a “constitutional crisis.” Last month, former Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in an interview that trying to come up with a legal theory that a court would see as legitimate was ""just a risky thing"" to do. ""The debate over the 14th Amendment has gone on, you know, for a number of years. I think you got to go back to the history. It was written to pay Union debts and to treat Confederate debts not as Union debts. It was not meant to be a broad grant of power,"" Lew said. ""Somebody could challenge the legitimacy of the action. And again, we’re the reserve currency of the world. Full faith and credit is unquestioned. If you put it into question, I think it’s risky to the whole enterprise, which affects our economic and national security."" Lew also said that the ""platinum coin"" option — the idea that the president could simply order production of a trillion-dollar coin and use it to pay down debt, which OLC also considered — was very risky. ""I don’t think, you know, the solution is for us to kind of pretend that there are easy things like a magical coin that solves the problem,"" Lew said. ""I always believed that any of the ideas that were kind of fringe ideas were very risky. I’m not going to say with absolute certainty what you can and can’t do. I wouldn’t recommend taking those risks."" "
FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried seeks dismissal of indictment,Associated Press,"May 9, 2023, 1:28 PM UTC",Tech News,"FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried sought a dismissal of criminal charges against him in a court filing late Monday, saying prosecutors have improperly made federal crimes out of civil and regulatory issues that resulted from an industrywide collapse of cryptocurrency markets dubbed the “crypto winter.” Lawyers for the onetime head of a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange said in papers in Manhattan federal court that the U.S. government had a “dramatic — and troubling” response to a broad market crash in cryptocurrency last year that affected every corner of the market. They said Bankman-Fried’s non-U.S. FTX company lasted far longer than others in the industry before it entered bankruptcy in November when the global exchange ran out of money after the equivalent of a bank run. A trial is tentatively set for the fall. Prosecutors alleged in December that Bankman-Fried cheated investors and looted customer deposits on FTX to make lavish real estate purchases, donate money to politicians and make risky trades at Alameda Research, his cryptocurrency hedge fund trading firm. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams has called it one of the biggest frauds in U.S. history. In March, new charges added to the indictment alleged that Bankman-Fried violated the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by directing the payment of $40 million in bribes to a Chinese official or officials to free up $1 billion in cryptocurrency that was frozen in early 2021. extradition from the Bahamas contained eight vague and non-specific charges against Bankman-Fried, his lawyers said Monday. The additional charges filed later violated an Extradition Treaty between the United States and the Bahamas, they added. “In the wake of the ‘crypto winter,’ the Government, in hindsight, may dislike or disapprove of business practices of the cryptocurrency industry, FTX, or even Mr. Bankman-Fried — but this does not give it license to turn them into federal crimes,” Bankman-Fried’s lawyers wrote. Bankman-Fried, 31, has been living with his parents in Palo Alto, California, under a $250 million bail arrangement that has severely limited his ability to communicate on the internet and move money around. In other papers filed Monday, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers sought dismissal of portions of the indictment on other grounds, including with arguments that some charges duplicated others. They also claimed that FTX debtors had become an arm of the government, casting Bankman-Fried as a villain and providing so much information to prosecutors that defense lawyers must worry that they will be unable to get their hands on documents that might help prove Bankman-Fried’s innocence. A message sent to a spokesperson for prosecutors was not immediately returned. "
China consultancy crackdown sends jitters across foreign business,Reuters,"May 9, 2023, 11:42 AM UTC",World,"Overseas business lobbies in China said on Tuesday they were unnerved by a sweeping crackdown on consultancy and due diligence firms that is damaging investor confidence in the world’s second-largest economy. The European Union’s ambassador to China also raised concern about what state media described as “intensifying” law enforcement aimed at protecting national security, and a broadening of legislation that criminalizes the transfer of information and data. The crackdowns “send a worrying signal and heighten the uncertainty felt by foreign companies operating in China,” the E.U.’s Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement. “The developments are not conducive to restoring business confidence and attracting foreign investment.” Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, also expressed worries about the crackdown, while calling on authorities to “more clearly delineate” which areas of due diligence were permissible. “Without proper due diligence, foreign companies will be unable to invest in new projects in China,” he said. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said authorities had “brought under control” the relevant companies, while aiming to “promote and standardize the healthy development of the relevant (consulting) industry.” China says it welcomes foreign investment as long as firms abide by its laws. The scrutiny of consultancies including Capvision Partners, which state media says is aimed at stopping the theft of state secrets including defense and technology, is the latest step in a yearslong campaign to tighten control of information. “This ... is part of a broader trend in China’s tightening grip on sensitive information, particularly in light of the ongoing tension between China and the United States,” said Ani Chaudhuri, CEO at data security platform Dasera. “The crackdown on consulting firms may be interpreted as a warning to foreign companies operating in China, highlighting the need for businesses to reassess their data handling practices and security measures.” On Monday evening, state broadcaster CCTV aired a 15-minute report on Capvision, saying it had accepted projects from overseas companies to source information, including “state secrets and intelligence” on sensitive sectors including defense and advanced technology. “Some of these enterprises have close relations with foreign governments, military and intelligence agencies,” CCTV said. From 2017 to 2020, Capvision accepted more than 2,000 remittances amounting to $70 million from hundreds of overseas companies, CCTV added as it carried footage of Capvision’s offices and interviews with state security agents. An expert hired by the firm was jailed for six years for “stealing, espionage and providing state secret intelligence abroad,” CCTV said. Capvision said in a statement soon after the broadcast that it would resolutely abide by national security rules. Staff declined interview requests when reached by Reuters on Tuesday. The CCTV report was the first clear indication of the national security scope of recent police action against several consulting firms. In March, the Beijing office of U.S. law firm Mintz was raided and five Chinese members of staff were detained. Police visited U.S. management consultancy Bain & Co’s Shanghai office last month. More scrutiny is expected, state media said. “The state security organ and other authorities will intensify law enforcement against activities that endanger national security, such as illegal consulting,” the state-owned Global Times said. Some observers said the scrutiny was retaliation for U.S. attempts to choke off Chinese access to advanced technologies, including semiconductors, that have seen a slew of sanctions imposed on Chinese firms and entities. “It is a concrete action taken by the Chinese government to step up counteraction against U.S. technology containment,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. There is particular concern that changes to the anti-espionage law from July 1 could ensnare more companies. Jorge Toledo Albinana, the EU ambassador to China, expressed his concern about the beefed-up law earlier on Tuesday saying it was “not very conducive” to China’s aim of opening up to more overseas business. The revisions will see all documents, data, materials and items “related to national security and interests” given the same protection as state secrets. The law does not define China’s national security or interests. “Practically any information could be considered a threat to China’s national security,” said Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, adding that officials had “wide latitude” to apply the law. "
McCarthy approaches Biden debt ceiling talks with the economy — and his job — at stake,Scott Wong,"May 8, 2023, 9:03 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — Five months after he grabbed the gavel, this week marks the start of a defining challenge of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s two decades in elected office: whether he can strike a deal with President Joe Biden that averts an unprecedented debt default and quells the hard-right conservatives ready to revolt against him. Failing to raise the debt limit in the next three weeks could be catastrophic for the U.S. economy, but neglecting to secure the spending cuts his right flank pushed for could spell doom for McCarthy's career. To achieve his lifelong ambition of becoming speaker, McCarthy, R-Calif., allowed hard-right conservatives to put him in a political straitjacket, and any one of them can now force a vote to remove him if he doesn't come through. At a high-stakes White House meeting on Tuesday, McCarthy will try to juggle those competing interests and jump-start negotiations with Biden that have been stalled since their first and only substantive, face-to-face meeting at the White House on Feb. 1. Biden has insisted that he’s happy to negotiate spending for fiscal year 2024 after Congress agrees to hike the debt ceiling with no strings attached. But a clean debt bill is a nonstarter for McCarthy. Twice this year, McCarthy proved the naysayers wrong — he captured the speaker’s gavel after a grueling 15 rounds of voting and then muscled his plan to hike the debt ceiling and enact big spending cuts through the House by the slimmest of margins. That remarkable show of GOP unity strengthened his hand in the debt standoff, but the real test for McCarthy will be if he can keep his grip on the gavel and negotiate with the Senate and the White House on legislation that can pass and become law. Going into the meeting, McCarthy seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest. A McCarthy spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. McCarthy is an “honest man” but he “just about sold away everything [to the] far, far right,” Biden said in an interview with MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle ahead of his meeting with congressional leaders. “There’s the Republican Party and there’s the MAGA Republicans,” the president said, “and the MAGA Republicans really have put him in a position where in order to stay speaker he has to agree — he’s agreed to things that maybe he believes, but are just extreme.” During the knock-down, drag-out speaker battle in January, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., emerged as McCarthy's most fervent foe, vowing that McCarthy would never seize the gavel. In the end, Gaetz folded his cards, but he extracted concessions that allow him to continue to be a thorn in the speaker’s side. Gaetz or one of his allies now have the power to trigger a so-called “motion to vacate” if McCarthy cuts a debt deal with Biden and the Democrats that they feel is too liberal. He was already one of four GOP lawmakers who voted against McCarthy’s debt ceiling package that narrowly passed the House 217-215 — with just one vote to spare. Gaetz and his camp believe they have the upper hand over McCarthy, said one Gaetz ally in Congress. “He didn’t get taken off one committee and he is right back in the news, and not in a negative light,"" the lawmaker said. It’s easier said than done, but moderate Republicans argue that McCarthy should focus on getting the best deal he can with Biden on debt and spending cuts rather than worry about threats to his unstable speakership. “A four-seat majority by definition is difficult. I didn’t like the single person to vacate rule,” said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents one of 14 GOP House districts that Biden won in 2020. “I think the speaker can’t let this fact dominate though, and he seems to be playing this right."" “Good policy is good politics, and he’s winning,” Bacon said. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., chairman of the Republican Main Street Caucus, which describes itself as a bloc of pragmatic lawmakers, made clear that McCarthy will need to “deliver” a deal to his 222 members that addresses what Republicans see as out-of-control federal spending. One idea in the House-passed McCarthy plan is stricter work requirements for those who rely on safety-net programs like Medicaid and food stamps. “I think Kevin McCarthy will have a lot of latitude on the specifics. He won’t have as much latitude on the magnitude of the deal. Republicans believe that major action is needed now,” Johnson said in an interview. “We don’t necessarily have to have every single thing exactly the way we proposed it,” Johnson continued. “But the final package does need to be a substantial change in how our country spends and borrows money. And Kevin McCarthy is going to have to deliver that. And he understands that, and he’s prepared to do it.” Another pressure point for McCarthy is that he’s defending his fragile House majority in 2024. Trying to exploit that vulnerability, Biden on Wednesday will hold a campaign-style rally in the district of Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who last year flipped a Democratic-held seat in the Hudson River Valley. Ahead of Biden’s visit, Lawler maintained he would not allow a debt default to happen. But he also said he believed McCarthy is in a stronger negotiating position after the House passed his debt plan. “If we are in a situation where default is on the table, of course, the objective is to absolutely 100% avoid default, but nobody should be playing the chicken game here and trying to force somebody to blink,” Lawler said in a phone interview. McCarthy’s hand is strengthened, Lawler argued, “because we’re the only ones that have actually acted on this.” Time is running short. Last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen informed McCarthy that the U.S. could run out of measures to pay its debt obligations and default for the first time ever as early as June 1, sooner than previously expected. ""It’s widely agreed that financial and economic chaos would ensue"" if the U.S. defaults, Yellen warned Sunday. Senior Republicans aren’t confident in a Biden-McCarthy deal, but they argue that things are moving in the right direction after House Republicans passed their debt hike and spending cuts package that served as an opening bid in negotiations. “Instead of being at the depths of the ocean, I’m merely drowning,” House Financial Services Chairman Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., a McCarthy ally, said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation."" “So, my level of optimism is from complete and utter pessimism that anything can get done to some level of modest pessimism now.” A short-term extension of the debt limit could be one way to stave off an immediate default that would likely force a downgrade in U.S. credit rating, roil the stock market, deplete 401(k) and other retirement accounts, and possibly catapult the economy into recession. Although there has been bipartisan skepticism of a short-term deal, both the White House and key Republicans like McHenry say all options must be kept on the table given that the deadline is just three weeks away. Punting the debt hike for several months would align the issue with the annual government funding process — which will run out on Sept. 30 — allowing Republicans to say that the two issues are moving in tandem while Biden could insist that they are on separate tracks. Twelve years ago, another Democratic president and a GOP speaker found themselves in a similar situation. President Barack Obama and Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, were on the verge of a historic debt default one year before Obama would face voters as he sought a second term. At the 11th hour, Obama and Boehner cut a deal known as the Budget Control Act that hiked the debt ceiling by $400 billion while creating a bipartisan supercommittee responsible for tackling the deficit. Before Boehner needed to raise the debt limit again in 2015, he announced his resignation, then reached another deal with Obama and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., a former House assistant speaker who served in the lower chamber with McCarthy, said McCarthy appears to be prioritizing saving his speakership over averting a default. “When Speaker Boehner was confronted with this, he said, ‘Fine, bring it on. I’m here to do a job. And I’m going to do what’s right for the American people, and I’m going to stand by that ideal.’ That does not appear to be where Speaker McCarthy is, which is, ‘Hold on to the speakership,' which seems to be the priority. In this case, preventing the default should be the priority,” Lujan said in an interview. “You wanted to be speaker, you’re in that position. Now, you have a responsibility for the entirety of the American people, our country,"" the senator added. ""And so with that responsibility comes tough decisions that have to be made.” "
Biden admin proposes requiring airlines to compensate travelers for cancellations and delays,Summer Concepcion,"May 8, 2023, 2:52 PM UTC / Updated May 8, 2023, 6:38 PM UTC",Joe Biden,"The Biden administration on Monday announced plans for new regulations to require airlines to provide compensation and cover expenses for meals and hotel rooms to stranded passengers when the companies are at fault for travel disruptions. ""I know how frustrated many of you are with the service you get from your U.S. airlines,"" President Joe Biden said in remarks from the White House announcing his administration's plan. ""That's why our top priority has been to get American air travelers a better deal."" He said that later this year, his administration will propose a historic new rule that will make it mandatory for all U.S. airlines to compensate travelers for ""meals, hotels, taxis, rideshares and rebooking fees and cash, miles and, or travel vouchers whenever they're the ones to blame for the cancellation or delay. That's all on top of refunding the cost of your ticket."" The administration has also expanded an online dashboard to provide travelers with more transparency on airlines' compensation policies, Biden added. ""These actions are in addition to other progress we’re making to lower costs for American families, holding corporations accountable and growing our economy from the bottom up in the middle out, not just the top down,"" he said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg joined Biden for the announcement and said the administration has already seen improvements each month so far this year. He said that preliminary data shows cancellation rates for flights are below 2%. Buttigieg said, however, that the summer travel season is going to ""put enormous pressure on the system."" Airlines currently do not guarantee cash compensation when an airline-related issue causes a significant delay or cancellation. Airlines often guarantee frequent flyer miles, travel credits or vouchers to passengers who experience delays or cancellations caused by an issue within the airline’s control, such as a mechanical issue. The Transportation Department said in a release that it seeks to ensure that passengers are better protected against financial losses with the proposed rules, and that it plans to define “controllable cancellation and delay” in this rulemaking. The announcement comes as part of a push by the Biden administration to improve customer service to airline passengers. The Transportation Department unveiled an online dashboard designed to improve customer service after widespread flight disruptions last summer. The dashboard allows passengers to check an airline’s refund policy and compensation in the event of a flight cancellation or delay. Many of the largest U.S. airlines guarantee meals or hotel stays when they are at fault for a delay or cancellation, according to the dashboard. The department also said it believes that the proposed rules will help improve airlines' on-time performance. It launched an investigation into Southwest Airlines after thousands of its flights were canceled in late December. The department said it was investigating whether company executives scheduled an unrealistic volume of flights, “which under federal law is considered an unfair and deceptive practice.” The carrier said it is cooperating with all inquiries.

"Jeffries won’t commit to a short-term debt ceiling deal, insists on clean increase",Summer Concepcion,"May 7, 2023, 2:26 PM UTC",Congress,"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., on Sunday wouldn't commit to supporting a short-term extension of the debt ceiling and insisted on a ""clean"" debt ceiling lift, in an exclusive interview on “Meet the Press,” as congressional leaders remain in a gridlock to work out a deal. Asked by NBC News' Chuck Todd whether he accepts the premise that Democrats won't get a clean debt ceiling hike, Jeffries said: “I do not because we have a constitutional responsibility to make sure that we protect the full faith and credit of the United States of America."" “Everyday Americans understand this principle: If you have a bill, you need to pay it,” he added. “If you fail to pay it. It’s going to adversely impact your credit rating, your credit score will drop. If your credit score drops, your costs are going to go up and if America defaults on our bills, that’s exactly what is going to happen. And everyone is going to pay the price.” The White House is weighing whether to broker a short-term extension of the debt ceiling to allow more time to pass a larger increase, five sources familiar with the matter told NBC News last week — a backstop with three weeks until the current deadline in June. Jeffries argued that “the only responsible” action would be to help President Joe Biden raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default as Democrats did three times during the Trump administration. Asked if a short-term fix is the best way forward, Jeffries said: “Well, I don’t think the responsible thing to do is to kick the can down the road when President Biden has been saying, for months — the position of leader Schumer, the position of House Democrats — has been we have to avoid a default."" ""America should pay its bills. Protect the full faith and credit of the United States of America,"" he said. House Republicans are pushing to attach spending cuts to a debt ceiling increase, while Democrats have hesitated to negotiate over whether to pay the country’s bills or default. Democrats, resistant to policy conditions, have insisted on a clean debt limit hike. They want Congress to negotiate over spending cuts that Republicans have demanded in the separate government funding process, which has a deadline of Sept. 30. Jeffries said Democrats are open to discussing what types of investments, spending and revenues are “appropriate” to protect the “health, safety and economic well-being” of the American people. “That’s a process that is available to us right now,” he said. “I don’t think we need to delay those discussions for a few months.” Jeffries’ remarks come before he and other congressional leaders are scheduled to meet with Biden this week to discuss the looming debt limit deadline, which could be as early as June 1. The Biden administration agrees with Jeffries' remarks, saying that a short-term extension is ""not our plan,"" a White House spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. ""We are focused on removing the threat of default, which will erase our economic progress,"" the spokesperson added. ""As the President has made clear, default is not negotiable.” The office of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Biden last week insisted that he will only accept a bill with no strings attached, as he dismissed Republicans’ demands for concessions ahead of the meeting on Tuesday with congressional leaders, including McCarthy, Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The president has said he plans to reiterate to the leaders during the meeting that “they should do what every other Congress has done, that is pass the debt limit, avoid default.” Biden invited the lawmakers to the meeting hours after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a letter that the U.S. could breach the debt ceiling as soon as June 1, narrowing the timeline from the June 5 date she previously had set. It’s common for the Treasury to adjust the date for when money runs dry based on fluctuating tax collections that can be tricky to predict. Forty-three Senate Republicans, including leadership, on Saturday said in a letter to Schumer that they won’t support a clean debt ceiling lift without spending cuts in a letter to Schumer. In the letter, led by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, the Senate Republicans wrote that they're “united” behind their colleagues in the House “in support of spending cuts and structural budget reform as a starting point for negotiations on the debt ceiling.” “As such, we will not be voting for cloture on any bill that raises the debt ceiling without substantive spending and budget reforms,” they wrote. Only six Republicans in the chamber did not sign onto the letter, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Josh Hawley of Missouri. With the absence of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Democrats would need 10 Republicans to join them in voting for a debt ceiling increase, which they already appear to fall short of. The letter from Senate Republicans, however, does not mention whether they would be open to a short-term fix. The White House swiftly pushed back against Republicans’ call for attaching spending cuts to any debt limit increase. “At a moment when the country just posted historic jobs gains, this is no time for these Senators to reverse their support for avoiding default without conditions during the Trump presidency,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement shared with NBC News. “They need to honor their Constitutional obligation to pay our bills and not unilaterally inflict a recession on the country,” Bates added. “The American people would not stand for that threat under any circumstances, but especially not to allow the draconian cuts in the House bill that would throw veterans, law enforcement, manufacturing workers, and sick children under the bus.” "
Warren Buffett says bank runs would have been 'catastrophic’ without government intervention,Rob Wile,"May 6, 2023, 5:20 PM UTC",Business News,"Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, praised the government's intervention in recent bank failures, saying on Saturday it averted what could have become an even bigger crisis. Yet he said the U.S. banking system had become overly complicated — and that he was not surprised that the banks had failed. He said he'd been selling bank stocks, first at the start of the pandemic and more recently over the past six months as banks increasingly face mismanagement and respond to bad incentives. ""The American public doesn’t understand their banking system — and some people in Congress don’t understand it anymore than I understand it,"" Buffett said. Speaking during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, about the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Buffett said he thought the government did the right thing in stepping in to guarantee bank deposits above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantee of $250,000. “It would have been catastrophic,” Buffett said of a situation in which the government didn’t act. He added that refusing to guarantee all SVB deposits risked a “run on every bank in the country” and, by extension, a threat to the global financial system. Berkshire Hathaway, the Omaha-based conglomerate that owns and invests in companies ranging from Dairy Queen to Geico, has substantial investments in the largest banks in the country. As of the end of 2022, Buffett’s investments included a 13% stake in Bank of America, 3.2% stake in Bank of New York Mellon, 2.8% stake in Citigroup and 0.5% stake in U.S. Bancorp. The banking industry has been rattled by higher interest rates, which squeezed banks unprepared for the sharp drop in the value of its interest rate-sensitive assets. Buffett said he was worried about how easy bank runs had become. ""If people think deposits aren’t sticky anymore, you’re living in a different era,"" he said, adding technology has made it so that ""you could have a run in a few seconds."" A new poll from Gallup found that nearly half of Americans say they are now worried about the safety of their deposits, the highest share since the global financial crisis of 2008. Yet even as he worried about the ease with which additional bank runs could occur — and recounted how his father lost his job in 1931 as the result of a bank run — Buffett said the U.S. government actions should have demonstrated that concerns about deposit safety were unfounded. “Here we are in 2023, and we actually see the FDIC pay off 100 cents on the dollar to everybody, or making it available to all demand deposits,” Buffett said. The banking crisis episode has led to heightened scrutiny on the commercial real estate sector, where telework arrangements and soaring borrowing costs are raising concerns about banks that lend to the sector. “The hollowing out of the downtowns in the United States and elsewhere in the world is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant,” said Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who added that Berkshire itself is not actively exposed to commercial real estate. Buffett praised Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, saying no one understood the current economic environment better than him. But he also warned that there was a limit to how much control the Fed had, and worried about having let ""the genie out of the bottle"" when it came to price growth and money printing eroding faith in the U.S. dollar. ""We are not as well off in relation to curbing inflation expectations — which become self fulfilling — we are not as well off as we were earlier,"" Buffett said. Yet even as Buffett acknowledged uncertainty about the course of the erosion of purchasing power, he rejected the idea that the U.S. dollar was in danger of losing its global-reserve status. ""I see no option for any other currency to be the reserve currency,"" Buffett said. Buffett also spoke briefly on the debt limit, noting that he could not imagine the U.S. government allowing “the debt ceiling to cause the world to go into turmoil.” Congress and the White House are barreling toward a June 1 deadline to raise the limit on how much the U.S. Treasury is allowed to borrow, with the “economic and financial catastrophe” of a government default on the line. Nonetheless, Buffett expressed broad worry about the trajectory of U.S. politics. “Partisanship, it seems to be, has moved toward tribalism, and tribalism just doesn’t work as well.” The nonagenarians also fielded questions on the application of artificial intelligence on investing — and the world at large. As Wall Street weighs the use of tech like ChatGPT in forecasting stock prices, Buffett said “the tech doesn’t make any difference” in finding investable opportunities. Buffett, whose reputation for stock picking built Berkshire, added that “what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things.” Broadly, Buffett expressed concern that society can’t “un-invent” technology that changes the future, but adamantly said humans remain in the driver’s seat. “With AI, it can change everything in the world except how men think and behave,” Buffett said, loosely quoting Albert Einstein’s commentary on the invention of the atom bomb. Munger quipped that “old fashioned intelligence works pretty well.” Known as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett currently ranks fifth on Forbes' billionaires list, with a net worth of about $105 billion. Throughout his decades in business, Buffett has earned a reputation as one of the smartest investors alive — all while maintaining a relatively frugal lifestyle (he still lives in the house he purchased in 1958, and regularly eats McDonald's). Buffett's strategy is broadly defined as value investing; buying low and only selling when absolutely necessary. Buffett advises holding onto good investments for decades at a time, while ignoring most short-term market movements. Instead of frequently checking a stock’s price, Buffett said, “you’d look to the earnings and dividends over the years as determining whether you made a good investment or not. And that’s what people should do with stocks.” The annual Berkshire shareholders meeting, dubbed by Buffett and fans as the ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" has seen as many as 40,000 attendees pile into the largest convention center in Omaha, Nebraska. It will be the 59th time Buffett has presided over Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting. The gathering has also become known for its marathon Q&A session: Buffett, 92, and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 99, are slated to take questions from attendees for at least five hours on Saturday. Like most investors, Berkshire is coming off a down year, at least on paper: It reported an annual loss of $22.8 billion for 2022. But in his most recent annual letter to shareholders — the release of which is itself a seminal event on investors' calendars — Buffett called that figure “100% misleading” because it includes losses on stock holdings whose “quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly and mindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors.” Instead, Buffett said, investors should look at the operating earnings of Berkshire's wide-ranging portfolio of companies, which as of year-end included American Express, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Occidental Petroleum and Paramount Global. On that basis, Berkshire ""set a record at $30.8 billion,"" Buffett said. What's more, Buffett calculated that the rate of return to Berkshire shareholders over its 58 years of existence has been 3,787,464%. He attributed this success to continuous savings, ""the power of compounding,"" avoiding ""major"" mistakes, and what he called ""the American Tailwind."" ""America would have done fine without Berkshire,"" Buffett wrote. ""The reverse is not true."" Berkshire on Saturday reported a 12.6% increase in operating earnings between March 31 and the same time last year. But Buffett said a slowdown in the economy would likely lead to a “majority of our businesses” reporting lower earnings this year than last year. "
"Debt limit debate, which puts the nation's credit and trust on the line, endangers already fragile U.S. economic outlook",Brian Cheung,"May 6, 2023, 12:32 PM UTC",Economy,"Congress and the White House barrel toward a June 1 deadline to resolve a debate over the debt ceiling, putting the credit and trust of the United States on the line. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that failing to lift or suspend the debt ceiling would lead to “economic and financial catastrophe,” darkening a U.S. economic outlook already clouded by elevated inflation, high interest rates and unease in the banking industry. The Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury Department projected May 3 that if the government doesn’t pay its bills for even a week, 500,000 Americans would lose their jobs as the economy contracts by 0.6%. A “protracted” default, lasting longer than three months, would trigger a Great Recession type of scenario in which as many as 8.3 million people could lose their jobs. In that situation, the stock market could fall by 45%, hurting the accounts of those saving for retirement. Those still working would be squeezed by even higher interest rates. Mortgage rates, for example, might rise further after already spiking from about 3% in December 2021 to 6.4% this month. Economists say those scenarios loom over a U.S. already at risk of recession. Deutsche Bank projects a recession to begin at the end of this year as a result of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to raise interest rates and deliberately slow an economy plagued by high inflation. Despite unemployment sitting at a historic low of 3.4%, high inflation is outpacing wage gains. Americans have had to tap into their savings to make ends meet. Households saved a total of $1.6 trillion before the pandemic, but now sit on $1 trillion in savings. Credit card rates, at almost 24%, according to LendingTree, loom over $986 billion in credit card balances, surpassing the pre-pandemic high by $59 billion. In addition to high borrowing costs and concerns that the job market will reverse course soon, The Conference Board’s measure of consumer expectations is at levels “associated with a recession within the next year.” A debt ceiling debacle would only worsen that outlook, economists say. “If you did ride over this cliff and the government were to technically default, that would be a major problem. It would cause a global crisis,” Deutsche Bank U.S. senior economist Brett Ryan said of a potential default. The debt ceiling is a legal limit on how much debt the U.S. Treasury is allowed to issue. The government breached that limit on Jan. 19, after which it scrambled to find cash elsewhere to keep the lights on. The Treasury Department estimates it will exhaust those “extraordinary measures” as early as June 1 — a date that could change depending on difficult to predict factors like tax payments from last month’s filing deadline. After June 1, the government would be at risk of defaulting — or missing payments on its debt. “We’d be in uncharted territory, and the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could be quite averse,” the nation’s top economic policymaker, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, said May 4. Failing to pay the bills would erode trust in U.S. government debt, seen up to date as largely “risk-free” due to the nation’s track record of paying its debts on time and in full. A default could lead to a dramatic decline in the value of U.S. government bills, notes and bonds (thus raising the “yield” that their coupons pay out as a percentage of their value). Nearly every corner of the finance world relies on U.S. government yields as a benchmark. Investors at home and abroad closely watch yields when trading securities. Mortgage lenders look at U.S. Treasuries when deciding what rates to charge you when buying a home. Third Way estimates that a default could add $130,000 to the cost of an average 30-year mortgage. The U.S. may not even have to technically default to realize some of these effects. In 2011, credit ratings agency S&P downgraded the nation’s prized AAA rating because of the “political brinksmanship” of its debt ceiling deliberations. The downgrade, which was never reversed, raised government borrowing costs by an estimated $1.3 billion. There are particular corners of the U.S. financial system at risk now, which would make any negative debt ceiling outcome particularly pronounced in 2023. Spiking government bond yields could worsen the picture for commercial real estate, where telework arrangements have squeezed landlords saddled with debt at rising interest rates. The failures of three top 30 U.S. banks in the past two months add to the risks. The collapse of First Republic Bank on May 1 revived concerns about the ability of regional banks to survive higher interest rates, a conundrum that could worsen if a debt limit standoff further pushes U.S. government yields higher, in turn further raising interest rates. Moreover, economists worry that the political air may not be there to quickly respond to any acceleration of the banking system issues, if needed. “Complicating any future debate over a government rescue is a threatened standoff over the debt ceiling,” wrote Wells Fargo Investment Institute strategists Gary Schlossberg and Jennifer Timmerman on April 25. Goldman Sachs Economics noted May 1 that the GOP is also factoring in the 2024 election into any debt ceiling strategy, as it “presents the best opportunity for congressional Republicans to wrest any policy concessions from the President.” Although it is a mechanism to cap government borrowing, the debt ceiling does not cap spending. The federal budget process, separate from the debt ceiling, determines how much money the government spends — and where it is spent. Still, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden continue to be at odds over how to tie the two together. McCarthy is attempting to couple an increase on the borrowing limit with spending cuts, but Senate Democrats and the White House are standing resolute on a “clean” bill that would raise the debt ceiling — while leaving debates on spending to the separate, annual budget process. Despite the impasse, history is on the side of resolution. Since 1960, Congress has moved 78 separate times to raise or extend the debt limit. Deutsche Bank’s Brett Ryan said he expects Congress to pass a short-term extension that would punt the debt ceiling debate to the end of September, when the economy may already be weak. “It only adds to recession probabilities,” Ryan said.

Prices for canned tomato goods could rise as California farms stay soggy after record rain,Deon J. Hampton,"May 6, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Ketchup, spaghetti sauce, tomato soup and salsa, all staples in the American kitchen, may be in short supply with higher prices this summer after record rainfall saturated California's tomato fields. With soil still too wet for planting, farmers postponed the season's start by three weeks, which could translate into a shortage of tomato-based items this summer, according to individual farmers and the California Tomato Growers Association. The most dire predictions come from farmers themselves, who say some of them could be forced out of the tomato-growing business. To make up for a shortened planting season, which usually runs 12 weeks from late February to May, some growers are putting more seeds into the ground than usual. But even then, it may be too late, they said. “I don’t think anybody is very optimistic about what our yields are going to be this year,” said Aaron Barcellos, a fourth-generation farmer who owns A-Bar Ag Enterprises in the San Joaquin Valley, California's main agricultural region, which is nicknamed ""America's salad bowl."" “You can definitely walk into a store and not see your favorite sauce,"" he said. ""You can see increased prices on consumers for ketchup and salsas and other tomato products.” "
Robert Kennedy Jr. to make campaign debut at bitcoin conference,Alex Seitz-Wald,"May 6, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC",2024 Election,"WASHINGTON — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s first appearance as a presidential candidate will be at a cryptocurrency conference in Miami this month as the iconoclastic Democrat embraces a controversial industry that environmentalists say is a major contributor to climate change. Kennedy, the vaccine-skeptic environmental lawyer whose uncle was President John Kennedy, has not held any public campaign events since he launched his Democratic primary bid against President Joe Biden last month in Boston, the homeland of his famous family. Before stumping in an early primary state like New Hampshire, Kennedy will keynote the Bitcoin 2023 conference, billed as the “biggest bitcoin event in the world,” where tickets start at $899 and the all-access VIP “Whale” pass goes for $9,999. “We asked him to speak after hearing his positive comments toward the bitcoin industry,” said Brandon Green, chief of staff to conference organizer BTC Media. Kennedy will not be paid for his appearance, Green said. And his spokesperson, Stefanie Spear, said Kennedy would not accept speaking fees for any events during his 2024 presidential campaign. While many policymakers turned away from the crypto industry after a series of high-profile failures that wiped out small-time investors and led to federal fraud charges, Kennedy has positioned himself as one of the nation’s most prominent political champions of cryptocurrency. Anthony Scaramucci, the crypto-friendly investor who briefly served as former President Donald Trump's communications director, said Kennedy’s promotion of cryptocurrency could endear him to its millions of devoted users. “In my mind, there’s this shadow fandom or currently invisible lobbying group — and it’s probably currently about 77 million people — of bitcoin or other cryptocurrency holders in the United States,” said Scaramucci, who was quick to say he did not agree with all of Kennedy’s beliefs. “I think it’s going to be a topical issue in 2024, and I would imagine that one of these presidential nominees will embrace bitcoin. And if they do, that’ll give them an edge.” While the bitcoin community has “a libertarian bent by nature"" that may not align with most Democrats, Scaramucci said, “these are people who are typically agnostic to party."" The only other political leaders speaking at Bitcoin 2023 are Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy — who said he considered picking Kennedy as his running mate — Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and the governor of the Indonesian state of West Java. In a series of tweets, Kennedy echoed libertarian views of cryptocurrency as a tool to fight repressive governments and hailed it as ""a major innovation engine."" “Monetary freedom is as important as freedom of speech. Without it, we are slaves,” Kennedy wrote. “It’s not outlandish to imagine that even here in America, your bank account could one day be frozen because of your politics, or comments you’ve made on social media.” As U.S. regulators look to impose new guardrails on cryptocurrency, Kennedy defended the industry from what he called an “extra-legal war on crypto” and suggested the “FDIC/SEC war on crypto caused failures of [Silicon Valley Bank], Signature and Silvergate banks.” The stance puts Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who founded the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance, at odds with most other environmentalists, who say cryptocurrencies' enormous energy consumption is a major contributor to climate change. A major study published last year found that crypto may contribute as much to climate change as the beef or crude oil industries, especially since miners seeking rock-bottom electricity rates often turn to dirtier sources of electricity. Crypto “miners” use massive computer arrays that globally consume as much electricity as mid-size countries like Norway and produce as much e-waste as the Netherlands. American crypto operations consume about as much electricity as every home computer or all the residential lighting in the United States. The industry has pledged to go green, and other cryptocurrencies have made major strides by switching to a different validation method that requires vastly less energy. Etherium, the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, saw energy consumption reduced by 99.9% after it switched. But bitcoin remains both the biggest cryptocurrency and by far its biggest polluter, making Kennedy's decision to speak at what organizers say is a ""bitcoin only"" conference especially notable. “This problem is really limited to bitcoin and maybe a couple of other smaller cryptocurrencies at this point,” said Elizabeth Moran of the environmental nonprofit Earth Justice, who works on crypto regulation. “Energy consumption is so great in some places that utility bills are skyrocketing for consumers, there’s increased fossil fuel consumption and increased water and air pollution."" Moran added that the ""industry is doing a lot of greenwashing."" The White House this week proposed a 30% excise tax on electricity used in crypto mining, which it said would make miners “pay their fair share of the costs imposed on local communities and the environment.” Kennedy opposes the tax as “a bad idea,” suggesting in his Twitter thread that bitcoin's environmental impact has been ginned up by nefarious actors. “Yes, energy use is a concern (though somewhat overstated), but bitcoin mining uses about the same as video games and no one is calling for a ban on those. The environmental argument is a selective pretext to suppress anything that threatens elite power structures,” Kennedy wrote. “It is a mistake for the U.S. government to hobble the industry and drive innovation elsewhere. Biden’s proposed 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining is a bad idea.” Asked to elaborate on his views, Spear Kennedy's spokesperson, said he believes the industry needs to switch to more renewable sources and take other steps to reduce its energy load. “The energy usage is a real issue, but must not be used as a pretext to hobble the currency,” she said.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to be deposed in Epstein lawsuits,Chloe Atkins,"May 6, 2023, 1:21 AM UTC",U.S. news,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is scheduled to be deposed this month in lawsuits involving the bank’s former client and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson confirmed to NBC News. The U.S. Virgin Islands and a women identified as “Jane Doe 1” sued JPMorgan Chase last year, accusing the Wall Street giant of turning a “blind eye” toward Epstein’s conduct and enabling Epstein’s sex-trafficking enterprise. The two suits seek monetary damages. JPMorgan Chase has denied liability. In a recent amended complaint, the U.S. Virgin Islands alleged that the financial institution continued to do business with Epstein, despite executives being aware of multiple sexual abuse and trafficking allegations against the convicted sex offender. “JPMorgan’s relationship with Epstein in allowing his sex-trafficking venture to access large sums of cash each year went far beyond a normal (and lawful) banking relationship,” the complaint read. JPMorgan Chase executive Mary Erdoes “admitted in her deposition that JPMorgan was aware by 2006 that Epstein was accused of paying cash to have underage girls and young women brought to his home,” according to the filing. In 2006, the financial institution’s rapid response team noted that Epstein ""'routinely' made cash withdrawals in amounts from $40,000 to $80,000 several times per month,” the complaint said. The withdraws amounted to more than $750,000 per year, according to the suit. Epstein’s conduct was “so widely known” at the financial institution that executives “joked about Epstein’s interest in young girls,” citing a 2008 email that Erdoes received asking her if Epstein was at an event with Miley Cyrus, the complaint said. JPMorgan Chase did business with Epstein until 2013. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution. He died in 2019 by suicide at a Manhattan correctional center where he was being held on federal sex-trafficking charges. In 2010, the financial institution’s risk management division flagged fresh accusations against Epstein. “See below new allegations of an investigation related to child trafficking — are you still comfortable with this client who is now a registered sex offender,” according to an internal email included in the complaint. The U.S. Virgin Islands said in court documents that “JPMorgan facilitated and concealed wire and cash transactions that raised suspicion of — and were in fact part of — a criminal enterprise whose currency was the sexual servitude of dozens of women and girls in and beyond the Virgin Islands.” “Human trafficking was the principal business of the accounts Epstein maintained at JP Morgan,” the suit said. In March, a federal judge in New York ruled that the lawsuits against the bank could move forward, partially denying the bank’s motion to dismiss the suits. "
"College seniors are graduating into a job market in flux, but a handful of industries are still eager to hire",J.J. McCorvey,"May 5, 2023, 8:41 PM UTC",Economy,"Millions of college seniors are donning their caps and gowns this week to walk across the stage and grab their hard-earned diplomas. They’ll also be walking into a labor market that is very much in flux, with some bright spots for employment opportunities alongside some toppling of expectations. Jobs growth last month beat analysts’ expectations in numbers released on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls increased 253,000 for April, more than the estimated growth of 180,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The low unemployment rate edged even lower, from 3.6% to 3.4%. But the report was the latest in a host of mixed signals about the health of the job market awaiting new graduates. Earlier this week, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for March showed new positions in the U.S. falling for the third consecutive month. Openings were down 384,000, the lowest level since April 2021. In an April survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, an industry group for recruiters and higher ed professionals, businesses said they expected to hire 4% more graduates from the class of 2023 than they did from the class of 2022. But that was a drastic decline from the group’s December projection of about 15%. Then, the ADP payroll report said private businesses added 296,000 jobs in April, more than double that of the previous month. Experts said a combination of factors got us here. Some industries, like the tech sector, have felt the brunt of the 10 interest rate hikes the Federal Reserve has implemented since March last year. In other areas, while the economy has generally recovered from the pandemic disruption, employers can’t find enough workers. “There still are sectors and enterprises that are having trouble getting the workers they need, and all one needs to do is travel in the United States to experience that,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate. Those sectors include health care and leisure and hospitality, which posted gains in Friday’s job report by about 40,000 and 31,000 openings, respectively. Gabbie Ferron, 22, will have a position waiting for her when she graduates from the University of Portland in Oregon on Sunday with her nursing degree. Ferron applied for the nurse resident opening at nearby Legacy Emanuel Medical Center one day in mid-April, received a call to interview for the role, and was hired the day after her interview. The process lasted all of two weeks. “It is, like, shocking,” said Ferron, who will participate in an 18-week apprenticeship at the hospital before becoming a registered nurse. It was the only job application she completed, and she agreed to take the night shift for an additional $6 per hour. A report released Tuesday by the recruiting software company iCIMS found that the class of 2023 expected an average salary of about $66,500, more than $8,000 higher than what employers expected to pay entry-level employees but lower than the previous year’s expected pay of $70,000. Ferron declined to say what her full pay rate will be, but said it was “more than I was expecting” and was “very comparable to all the other hospitals around here.” “I was stressed because every week in class, my nursing professors would be like, ‘OK, who has jobs?’” said Ferron. “And even in February, March, like half the class already had jobs.” A recent state-commissioned study showed that Oregon, like much of the country, is contending with a shortage of registered nurses. It would need to fill at least 13,500 positions to meet the need, the report said. Figures that ZipRecruiter shared with NBC News showed steep demand for roles in health care and education. Openings for nursing jobs increased by more than 12% since April 2022, while posts seeking high school teachers, for example, spiked 64%. Listings for jobs in the technology industry plummeted by more than half. “We don’t want all of the talk around layoffs in tech companies to dissuade students from entering the workforce,” said Daniel Voloch, chief program officer at Girls Who Code, a nonprofit group that trains and advocates for young-to-early career women and nonbinary people to enter the tech industry. “Working in the tech industry can mean so many different things, and that can mean working in health care, art or government,” said Voloch. “They can take all of the skills and experiences that they’ve been developing and apply it to a career in tech, even if it’s not at one of the big tech companies.” Some blue-chip brands have continued to invest in tech hiring amid the now-regular cadence of the industry itself hemorrhaging employees. Walmart recently subleased 21,000 square feet of office space in midtown Atlanta — populated by Georgia Tech University and its pupils — for what the company called its “Global Tech Atlanta Hub.” It will count Cisco and WeWork among its new neighbors. Another sector where graduates are finding difficulty landing: communications. In the Labor Department’s report, openings in the information industry — which includes publishing and telecommunications — posted only 1,000 new positions. ZipRecruiter data shows that openings for positions in the media industry have decreased by nearly 64% over the last year. Carly Wood, 22, will be graduating from Ohio-based Marietta College on Saturday. The graphic-design and strategic communications double major described her job search as the opposite of Ferron’s swift recruitment: After applying to 180 jobs, she’s only had about six interviews. None of them have materialized into employment. “I got to a point where I was literally kind of like anxious if I wasn’t actively applying to jobs throughout the day,” said Wood, who works as a barista at Starbucks. She said the roles she’s applied to range from graphic designer to social media manager. “I think that this field, particularly, is a little more saturated than people realize,” she said. “I think I’ve actually applied to every single job posting in the greater Columbus area at this point.” Economists emphasized a message of adaptability for students graduating into a shifting landscape. “There are opportunities. They may just not be exactly where you would have wanted to find them,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. Pollak said industries where “first-time” job seekers tend to start their professional journeys — positions that might not require a college degree, for example — are adding headcount, which could translate to “getting promoted quickly.” According to data from the N.Y. Fed, the underemployment rate for the U.S. job market — meaning the share of college graduates working a role that doesn’t require a college degree — is at 40%, the lowest in two decades. “I think it is forcing some students to keep an open mind about where they start their careers,” said Pollak. Eric Christensen, 26, graduated from the University of Utah last week with a communications degree. Despite applying to at least 10 full-time journalism positions in the Salt Lake City area, Christensen received only one callback. The company hasn’t followed up, he said. Christensen said, for now, he’ll wait out the economic uncertainty and stick with his part-time student services work at a local community college. He was married in February, and he and his wife recently got an apartment with a friend to split the rent. In the meantime, he’s applying to other positions in higher education where he can put his new degree to use, such as managerial positions similar to the part-time work he does in student services. “It’s been a relatively long search,” said Christensen. “And I’ve certainly felt the need for that full-time job compared to what I’m doing with my life right now.” CORRECTION (May 8, 2023, 2:30 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article mischaracterized the U.S. underemployment rate. At 40%, it is at its lowest in two decades, not highest. "
"Flush with cash, the IRS is offering a more accurate picture of when the U.S. will hit debt ceiling",The Associated Press,"May 5, 2023, 2:25 PM UTC",Economy,"That big infusion of cash that Congress approved last year to shape up the beleaguered IRS is having an unexpected side benefit. The funding increase has helped the agency to catch up on processing new and backlogged tax returns. And that, in turn, has allowed federal bean-counters to give policymakers a more precise picture of when the Treasury could run out of money — the so-called X-date — if the government isn’t able to take on more debt. The nation is stepping uncomfortably close to an unprecedented default that could have catastrophic effects on the global economy because it is bumping up against its legal limit for borrowing. Congress and the White House have been unable to agree on a plan to lift or suspend the borrowing limit. The debt covers the gap between revenues collected by the government and the programs, projects and services it provides. In the meantime, the Treasury is using “extraordinary measures” to keep the U.S. from running out of cash. The X-date arrives when Treasury has exhausted those accounting workarounds. Nina Olson, a former head of the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate, said the latest X-date calculation, provided through IRS data, offers a contrast to how underfunded the agency was in previous years. During the pandemic, the IRS was so backlogged that it was still processing 2020 returns at the start of 2022. “They have a better picture of what receipts will be,” Olson said. IRS and Treasury spokespeople declined to comment. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen informed Congress this week that the U.S. could default on its debt as early as June 1, if lawmakers do not raise or suspend the nation’s borrowing authority. That same day, the Congressional Budget Office reported that it, too, was able to zero in on a more accurate X-date because the IRS is “processing tax returns more rapidly than it did last year.” Tax and policy experts say the up-to-date IRS data is invaluable to understanding the nation’s financial position as the debate over whether to raise the debt ceiling drags on. “That, in combination with less-than-expected receipts through April, means that the Treasury’s extraordinary measures will be exhausted sooner than we previously projected,” CBO Director Phil Swagel said in his report. The X-date is typically not a specific date — it’s a time range. That’s because it reflects not just the money coming into the government, but the cash that goes out. Even if the government has a better sense of tax revenues, it could have to reimburse a state government, pay a contractor or face expenses that make the X-date a moving target. Natasha Sarin, a Yale Law School professor who previously worked as a counselor for Yellen on IRS issues, said the latest tax data reveals the “tremendous uncertainty that exists in determining the precise X-date.” The CBO, Moody’s Analytics and the private Bipartisan Policy Center all try to calculate the time frame for potential default using data on government cash flows and changes in debt. But even their leaders say that no one knows exactly when the X-date could arrive. That depends on the billions of dollars flowing in and out of federal coffers all the time. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said Thursday at a Senate Budget Committee hearing that he estimates the X-date to fall around June 8. The closer the nation gets to potential default, the more perilous the nation’s financial standing and the more accurate X-date forecasts become, economists say. President Joe Biden has invited the top four congressional leaders to the White House on Tuesday for talks — signaling the growing fears of a default. Daleep Singh, who served as deputy national security adviser earlier in the Biden administration, said the new tax data gives credibility to Treasury’s most recent assessment of the projected default date. He called the debt ceiling brinkmanship a national security issue, especially as the U.S. government’s relationship becomes more strained with China, as a major creditor holding U.S. debt. “This is a matter affecting our financial stability,” he said. ”If we commit an unforced error, we’re handing a gift to our adversaries.” "
"Job growth totals 253,000 in April, beating expectations even as the U.S. economy slows","Jeff Cox, CNBC","May 5, 2023, 1:16 PM UTC",Economy,"Job growth fared better than expected in April despite bank turmoil and a decelerating economy, the Labor Department reported Friday. Nonfarm payrolls increased 253,000 for the month, beating Wall Street estimates of 180,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate was 3.4%, against an estimate of 3.6%, and tied for the lowest level since 1969. A more encompassing number that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged lower to 6.6%. Average hourly earnings, a key inflation barometer, rose 0.5% for the month, more than the 0.3% estimate. On an annual basis, wages increased 4.4%, higher than the expectation for a 4.2% gain. Stock market futures held their gains following the report, while Treasury yields were sharply higher. Professional and business services led the job gains with an increase of 43,000. That was followed by health care (40,000), leisure and hospitality (31,000), and social assistance (25,000). Despite serious banking industry troubles, jobs in finance increased by 23,000. Government hiring rose by 23,000. April’s upside surprise was offset by sharp downward revisions in previous months. March’s count was slashed to 165,000, down 71,000 from the initial estimate, while February fell to 248,000, a reduction of 78,000. Also, the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a softer total jobs gain of 139,000. “It is encouraging to see a strong jobs report amid recession concerns, instability in the banking sector and ongoing layoffs,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group. “We are hopeful the continued strength of the jobs market and signs of slowing inflation will ease market volatility in the coming months.” Friday’s report comes amid persistent troubles in the banking industry, particular midsize regional institutions that have been hit by runs on deposits and worried investors who have sent share prices tumbling. That has come at the same time that the economy appears to be slowing toward a possible recession later in the year. Gross domestic product increased just 1.1% in the first quarter, largely on an inventory drawdown though there have been signs that consumer spending is weakening. Credit card spending, for instance, has declined 0.7% from a year ago, according to Bank of America. Despite the bank troubles and recession fears, the Federal Reserve this week raised its benchmark interest rate another quarter percentage point, taking it to its highest level since August 2007. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that higher interest rates were pressuring households, though he noted that the labor market has remained strong. He added that the economy “is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit conditions.” The central bank is striving to get inflation down to a 2% annual level, though it is well above that now. One measure, the consumer price index, shows inflation running at a 5% annual pace. Rising wages have helped pressure prices. Powell said a 3% annual wage gain is probably consistent with the Fed’s 2% mandate. "
Shopify cuts 20% of its workforce,"Annie Palmer, CNBC","May 4, 2023, 7:47 PM UTC",Tech News,"Shopify on Thursday announced it’s cutting 20% of its workforce. The news came as it reported first-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Shares of Shopify surged more than 26% in early trading. CEO Tobi Lütke announced the job cuts in a memo to employees posted on the company’s website. He didn’t specify which units will be affected as a result of the layoffs. “I recognize the crushing impact this decision has on some of you, and did not make this decision lightly,” Lütke wrote. Shopify had about 11,600 employees and contractors as of Dec. 31, according to a securities filing. The cuts mark the second round of layoffs for the Canadian e-commerce company. Shopify last July laid off 10% of its workforce after Lütke said the company had misjudged how long the Covid pandemic-fueled e-commerce boom would last. Lütke said Shopify is slimming down as a company as it focuses on its core business, which is making tools for companies to sell products online. The company separately announced Thursday that it’s offloading its logistics unit to Flexport, a sale that includes Deliverr, the last-mile delivery company it acquired for $2.1 billion last May. Shopify is also selling 6 River Systems, the warehouse robot maker it acquired in 2019 for $450 million, to U.K. retail tech company Ocado. Terms of the Flexport and Ocado deals weren’t disclosed. The moves bring an end to Shopify’s yearslong effort to build its own logistics business. Lütke called that effort a “worthwhile side quest” that could be an independent company in the future, but said Shopify is refocusing its priorities on e-commerce software, as well as newer initiatives such as artificial intelligence. “Shopify has the privilege of being amongst the companies with the best chances of using AI to help our customers,” Lütke said. Shopify also beat Wall Street estimates for the first quarter. The company reported revenue of $1.51 billion, which was up 25% from a year earlier, and exceeded Wall Street’s projected $1.43 billion, according to Refinitiv. It posted earnings of 5 cents per share. Excluding items, Shopify earned 1 cent per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of 4 cents per share. In the year-ago period, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion, or $1.17 a share. "
Some TurboTax users will soon be getting settlement checks,Rob Wile,"May 4, 2023, 6:46 PM UTC",Consumer,"Consumers who recently filed tax returns with TurboTax but were eligible for the Internal Revenue Service's Free File program will soon start receiving checks as part of a multistate settlement with TurboTax's parent company, Intuit. According to a press release Thursday from the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, eligible customers include those who paid to file federal income tax returns through TurboTax for the tax years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The $141 million settlement, announced a year ago, came in the wake of a 2019 ProPublica report that showed Intuit had steered low-income taxpayers toward its fee-based products after promising them access to no-cost tax filing services — in part by using advertisements that promised ""free, free, free"" filings. “Frequently ‘free’ didn’t mean free at all,” ProPublica reported. “Many who started in TurboTax Free Edition found that if their return required certain commonplace tax forms, they would have to upgrade to a paid edition in order to file.” Per the terms of the settlement, eligible customers will receive a check in the mail automatically, without having to file a claim. Most are expected to receive between $29 and $30, the press release said. “By requiring consumers to pay for tax-return services that should have been available for free, Intuit cheated taxpayers out of their hard earned money,” Pennsylvania Attorney General Michelle Henry said in a statement. “Intuit’s deceptive practices and aggressive advertising campaign were unnecessary and illegal; especially when the IRS offers free tax-return services for eligible consumers.” You can find more information on the settlement program here.

Biden gets support for debt ceiling fight from super PACs,Alex Seitz-Wald,"May 4, 2023, 4:58 PM UTC",White House,"WASHINGTON — Outside Democratic groups are coming to President Joe Biden’s defense in his standoff with House Republicans over the debt ceiling, pressuring vulnerable lawmakers ahead of a bipartisan meeting to discuss the nation's finances. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., will meet with Biden next week to push for spending cuts and other concessions the GOP wants in exchange for raising the statutory debt limit, but the White House continues to insist it won't negotiate over the nation's debt. In addition, the White House argues, the cuts Republicans want would be devastating to the economy. House Republicans passed a bill to raise the debt limit and make corresponding spending cuts — but didn't detail what any of those cuts would be and instead left them open to future negotiations. The maneuver may give them plausible deniability on any specific criticism, but that hasn't stopped Democrats, who insist the only way to meet GOP demands for reductions would be to make drastic cuts from the Border Patrol to health care and veterans services. That has created a political opening, Democrats say. “Speaker McCarthy and MAGA Republicans are so extreme, they are ready to drive middle-class costs up so they can slash education, clean air and water, and even cancer research,” Abby Curran Horrell, the executive director of House Majority Forward, the nonprofit arm of Democrats’ main House-focused super PAC, said in a message to NBC News. The group has been placing billboards, conducting polls and running digital and TV ads in battleground House districts since February as part of a six-figure campaign on the debt standoff. The messages include ransom note-style messages that say Republicans want to “hold our economy hostage to cut Social Security and Medicare.” Other progressive outside groups, like the League of Conservation Voters, Courage for America and Protect Our Care, have launched their own ad campaigns targeting vulnerable House Republicans for perpetuating “the Republican default crisis,” claiming the GOP plan would kill clean energy jobs, cut law enforcement and eliminate health care for many Americans to reduce taxes on the wealthy. Meanwhile, Accountable.US launched mobile billboard ads in five moderate congressional districts claiming the GOP plan would cut 13,000 law enforcement and Border Patrol officers. And Social Security Works, which promotes and defends the retirement program, purchased a billboard attacking Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif. — a perennial top target of Democrats — for using the debt crisis, it claims, to try to cut veterans and Social Security benefits. Republicans have said Democrats are mischaracterizing their plans, but the details are yet to be determined. Even groups that typically wait until election years to spend big are gearing up now. Priorities USA, Democrats’ flagship presidential super PAC, said it will use part of its previously announced $75 million spending goal for the 2024 cycle on the debt ceiling fight, because it fits with its plan to contrast “Biden’s steady leadership with the chaos that defines the GOP.” “This will include ads that reference the debt ceiling and other ongoing fights with congressional Republicans. We’ve also used our digital expertise to launch sustained social media programming to call out the hypocrisy and the callous decisions that have defined the GOP’s budget proposals,” said the group's executive director, Danielle Butterfield.

State attorneys general announce probe into the NFL over workplace discrimination,The Associated Press,"May 4, 2023, 4:36 PM UTC",U.S. news,"The attorneys general of New York and California announced Thursday that they are investigating allegations of workplace discrimination at the NFL, citing lawsuits filed by employees that describe sex, racial and age bias, sexual harassment, and a hostile work environment. Attorneys General Letitia James, of New York, and Rob Bonta, of California, said they have issued subpoenas to NFL executives as part of an examination into the workplace culture at the the league’s corporate offices in both states. The officials, both Democrats, said they are exercising their legal authority to seek information from the NFL regarding allegations of gender pay disparities, harassment, and gender and racial discrimination. The investigation focuses on the league’s corporate offices, not specific teams or players. “No person should ever have to endure harassment, discrimination, or objectification in the workplace,” James said in a statement. Bonta said he and James have “serious concerns about the NFL’s role in creating an extremely hostile and detrimental work environment.” The league didn’t immediately comment on the investigation. James and Bonta cited a 2022 New York Times story that detailed allegations of gender discrimination by more than 30 former female NFL employees. The women described a sexist culture at the NFL that they said persisted despite promises of reform that Commissioner Roger Goodell made after the 2014 release of a video that showed Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching his fiancee. Domestic violence charges against Rice were dropped. "
Nearly half of Americans — and 55% of Republicans — are worried about the safety of their money in banks,Rob Wile,"May 4, 2023, 3:37 PM UTC",Consumer,"Nearly half of Americans are now worried about the safety of their money in banks, according to a new Gallup poll. But the results are starkly divided between Democrats and non-Democrats — and even more among Americans with college degrees and those without. Still, the 48% overall figure represents the lowest reading since the Great Recession of 2007-09. The findings also come in the wake of the largest bank failures since then. In March, Silicon Valley Bank and New York-based Signature Bank were seized by regulators after depositors began pulling their funds from them en masse amid concerns about the banks’ health in response to rising interest rates. That set off a slow-motion panic that eventually brought down First Republic Bank last weekend. The Gallup poll was conducted April 3 to April 25 — after the failures of SVB and Signature but before the collapse of First Republic. Investor concerns about banks' health continued into Thursday, as shares in several other midsize banks tanked over fears of further depositor flight. While Wall Street may be driving some of the current negative sentiment, demographic data in the Gallup poll suggests other forces may also be at work. Among Democrats, just 36% express any concern about the safety of their funds compared with 55% for Republicans and 51% for Independents. The results are even more stark by education: Among individuals with a college degree, a combined 36% express any level of concern. Just 9% of that group say they are “very worried.” That's the lowest rate of respondents who say so among any of the demographic categories measured by Gallup. That compares with 54% of individuals without a college degree expressing any type of concern about their money — with 24% saying they are “very” concerned, the most among any of the groups. And wealthier respondents are less concerned than less-well-off ones: Just 40% of households with $100,000 or more in annual income say they are ""very worried"" or ""moderately worried,"" compared with 52% of households earning $40,000 to $99,999. Households earning less than $40,000 polling at 50%. Gallup says expression of concern seems to be related to trust in government overall, noting that in September 2008, when President George W. Bush was in office, more Democrats were worried about the safety of their funds than Republicans. “The views by party were nearly the reverse of those today,” Gallup notes. What’s more, after the government bailout of big banks in 2008 and Barack Obama’s presidential election win against John McCain, “Democrats’ and independents’ levels of worry dropped, while Republicans’ rose eight percentage points,” Gallup writes. Finally, Gallup notes the paradox that less well-educated and less well-off Americans are expressing more concern, given that deposits of up to $250,000 are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ""Worry among these groups may be higher because they do not know about FDIC insurance,"" Gallup said, ""or it may be linked to their displeasure with the current presidential administration and the U.S. economic situation.""

Michelle Obama launches company to promote healthy food for kids,Associated Press,"May 4, 2023, 12:03 PM UTC",Politics News,"WASHINGTON — Michelle Obama announced Wednesday that she has co-founded a company to make and sell healthier food and drinks for kids, products that she says will be less detrimental to their long-term health because of their lower sugar and higher nutrient content. The former first lady’s work with PLEZi Nutrition is an extension of her efforts to improve child nutrition when she was in the White House. “I’ve learned that on this issue, if you want to change the game, you can’t just work from the outside,” she said during a keynote address in New York at a conference on the future sponsored by The Wall Street Journal. “You’ve got to get inside. You’ve got to find ways to change the food and beverage industry itself.” “So today, I’m proud to announce the national launch of a company designed not just to provide better products, but to jump-start what I hope will be a race to the top that will transform the entire food industry,” she said. Obama said she is a co-founder and strategic partner of PLEZi Nutrition. She will work behind the scenes on its educational and philanthropic efforts, according to aides, who stressed that she will not be a spokesperson or a public face of the company. It was unclear whether she put any money down to help launch PLEZi Nutrition or whether she will draw a salary. As first lady, Obama sought through a White House initiative called “Let’s Move” to improve the health of U.S. children by encouraging them to engage in physical activity and eat healthier food. She worked to improve federal nutrition standards for school lunches and extracted commitments from food companies and restaurant chains to cut calories, salt, sugar and trans fats in their meals. But she said Wednesday that kids still are not getting the recommended levels of nutrients and are eating and drinking too much added sugar, an average of 53 pounds per year. Sugary drinks are youngsters’ main source of added sugar, she said, adding that nearly two-thirds of them have such a drink every day. PLEZi Nutrition, based in the District of Columbia, is a public benefit corporation, meaning that the for-profit company was created specifically for the public’s benefit and will balance its profit needs with its mission to help improve child nutrition. Obama also announced that the company is donating $1 million to an initiative by FoodCorps, a nonprofit organization that is working to help all 50 million students in the U.S. receive education about nutrition and free school meals by 2030. PLEZi Nutrition will also contribute 10% of its profits to the broader movement to improve child nutrition. "
Chinese apps remain hugely popular in the U.S. despite efforts to ban TikTok,"Lauren Feiner, CNBC","May 30, 2023, 12:36 PM UTC",Tech News,"For several years now, ByteDance’s TikTok has been the focus of lawmakers and intelligence officials who fear it could be used to spy on Americans. Those concerns took center stage during a five-hour grilling of TikTok’s CEO back in March. But while TikTok has been the one in the spotlight, other Chinese apps that present similar issues are also experiencing massive popularity in the U.S. Concerns about ByteDance stem in large part from a national security law that gives the Chinese government power to access broad swaths of business information if it claims to be for a national security purpose. U.S. intelligence officials and lawmakers fear that the Chinese government could effectively access any information that China-based app companies have collected from American users, from email addresses to user interests to driver’s licenses. But that doesn’t seem to have swayed many consumers, as several China-based apps are still booming in the U.S. For example, the shopping app Temu, owned by China-based PDD Holdings, has the number two spot on the Apple App Store among free apps as of late May. It also held the number 12 spot among digital retailers in the 2022 holiday season for unique visitors to its site, topping stores like Kohl’s, Wayfair and Nordstrom, according to Insider Intelligence, which also credits visibility on TikTok for its rise. Meanwhile, ByteDance-owned apps CapCut and TikTok hold the fourth and fifth spots on the App Store rankings. Chinese fast fashion brand Shein holds 14th. And between late March and early April, after the TikTok CEO hearing before Congress, ByteDance’s Lemon8, saw nearly 1 million downloads in the U.S., Insider Intelligence reported based on data from Apptopia. It’s an app with similarities to Pinterest and Meta’s Instagram. These apps share some of the features that have worried the U.S. government about TikTok, including about whether some of these firms adequately protect U.S. user data when operating out of China (TikTok has stressed that U.S. user information is only stored on servers outside of China). Like TikTok, these apps collect user information, can analyze trends in their interests and use algorithms to target consumers with products or information that is likely to keep them engaged with the service. But experts on China and social media say there are important differences between these apps and TikTok which might explain the relative lack of attention on them. Among the most important of those features is the scale of their presence in the U.S. Even as they grow, the U.S. userbase of many popular Chinese apps is still dwarfed by TikTok’s massive U.S. audience of 150 million monthly active users. TikTok sister app Lemon8, for instance, has an estimated 1.8 million monthly active users in the U.S., according to Apptopia. While TikTok has had 415 million downloads in the U.S. since its launch here, CapCut has had 99 million, Temu 67 million and Lemon8 1.2 million, according to Apptopia. Only Shein surpasses TikTok in downloads among this group of apps, though it launched far earlier in the U.S. in 2014. Shein’s app has 855 million downloads in the U.S. since its debut, though Apptopia estimates it has about 22 million monthly active users. “An app with a thousand, or even a million users in the U.S. does not present the same widespread cybersecurity threat that an app with 100 million users has,” said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund’s Alliance for Securing Democracy. Gorman said as the U.S. considers the threat posed by TikTok, it will also need to develop a framework for how to evaluate the relative risk of Chinese apps. The scale should be one factor, she said, and the type of app, including its ability to spread propaganda, should be another. “The ability for a Chinese technology platform to represent critical information infrastructure in a democracy has to be part of that calculus when assessing risk,” Gorman said. “That’s where I think the analogies with power grids or energy infrastructure are applicable. We we would not allow the authoritarian regime to build significant components of our energy infrastructure and rely on an authoritarian regime for that.” That means that an app like ByteDance’s CapCut may present a lower risk, both because of its smaller user base and because it’s meant to edit videos, rather than distribute them. “We’re really at the beginning stages of even recognizing that a broader characterization and categorization is actually needed,” Gorman said, adding that rather than playing whack-a-mole with Chinese technology that poses a threat to U.S. national security, the country should develop a more systematic framework. But in the meantime, U.S. consumers continue to turn to Chinese apps. “Among the most downloaded apps consistently are Chinese-based ones like Temu and CapCut,” said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst covering social media at Insider Intelligence. “And then of course, there’s the early growth of Lemon8, which suggests that the appetite for Chinese apps in the U.S. is still growing.” For e-commerce apps, the risk of spreading harmful misinformation may not be as high as on a social media service. An e-commerce platform like Temu or Shein is likely a less viable platform to spread propaganda than a video app like TikTok. “People just aren’t really spending the same amount of time on commerce apps and they’re not exposed necessarily to the same kind of content that could potentially have a negative impact on young people,” Enberg said. “I also don’t necessarily think that the connection to China for some of these apps is as clear to the average consumer and I also don’t think that consumers are really going around thinking about where the apps that they’re using originate from.” Still, the U.S. could find a reason for concern. A recent CNN report that found Temu sister company Pinduoduo, a shopping app popular in China, contained malware. The parent company of both apps, PDD Holdings, did not respond to a request for comment. Research staff at the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission pointed to that report in assessing Temu’s data risks, though an analyst recently told CNBC that Temu has not been as “aggressive” in requesting access to consumers’ data as Pinduoduo. At least one group has viewed the pressure on TikTok as an optimal time to raise concerns with another Chinese company popular in the U.S.: Shein. The group Shut Down Shein, which is a “coalition of individuals, American brands and human rights organizations,” according to executive director Chapin Fay, launched the day that TikTok’s CEO was hauled before Congress. “We were sort of agnostic on the timing, but we wanted to make sure that while people are talking about TikTok, there’s this other nefarious actor, Shein, who’s also collecting data and doing it all under the radar and also doing these other even worse things like slave labor,” said Fay, managing director of Actum consulting firm. The group specifically takes issue with Shein’s alleged use of forced labor, as Bloomberg reported last year that tests revealed that cotton in clothes shipped to the U.S. were linked to a region in China where the U.S. government has said forced labor is deployed. China has denied the use of forced labor. Shut Down Shein also rails against the company’s alleged use of an import loophole to avoid tariffs. Through the de minimis trade tax exemption, the group says, individual customers become the importer of their fast fashion goods, a practice that came up at a recent hearing by the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. A Shein spokesperson said in a statement that it “complies with the domestic tax legislations of the countries in which it operates.” The spokesperson also said that Shein has “zero tolerance for forced labor,” takes seriously visibility across its supply chain and requires suppliers to follow a “strict code of conduct.” Fay said it’s important to recognize that the way Shein has been able to grow its brand and gain new customers, in large part via so-called influencer hauls, is through TikTok. Faced with national security worries over TikTok, lawmakers have considered several proposals that could lead to a ban. But critics fear some proposed solutions could create a slippery slope of unintended consequences. And some say the most effective long-term solution for curbing the use of Chinese apps may be fostering an environment for robust alternatives to grow. Perhaps the most prominent of the bills that could lead to TikTok’s ban in the U.S., the RESTRICT Act, would give the Commerce Secretary the power to recommend barring technology that comes from a select group of foreign adversary countries if they determine the risks cannot be sufficiently mitigated otherwise. Though the proposal quickly garnered serious attention for its heavy-hitting group of sponsors, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., and Commerce subcommittee on communications ranking member John Thune, R-S.D., it’s since appeared to lose the early momentum. That’s due in part to concerns raised by the tech industry and others that the bill could give the executive branch broad power to seek a ban on certain technology. “While I understand that Americans enjoy the convenience of Chinese e-commerce and the creative tools of many Chinese communications apps, we have to reckon with the fact that these companies ultimately are beholden to the demands of the Chinese government,” Warner said in a statement. “We’ve had an important and overdue conversation about the predatory and invasive practices of U.S. tech firms in recent years; those same concerns are valid with the growing sway of these foreign apps — and then exacerbated by the manner in which these PRC-based companies serve as instruments of PRC power.” One of those critics of the bill’s current scope is Andy Yen, CEO of Proton, which makes an encrypted email service and VPN. While Yen believes that TikTok should be banned in the U.S., he fears the RESTRICT Act is currently too broad to effectively do so without additional consequences. In a recent blog post, Yen argued that the bill would give the Commerce Secretary overly-broad power to designate additional governments as foreign adversaries and feared that ambiguous language in the bill could be used to penalize individuals who use VPNs to access apps that are banned in the U.S. In the post, Yen suggested these issues could be resolved with changes to the bill’s language to make it more targeted and limited in scope. Speaking on the “Pivot” podcast recently, Warner stressed the need for a rules-based approach that could be legally upheld to deal with tech from foreign adversaries. He said he believes criticism of the bill, including that it would target individual VPN users or that U.S. companies that do business in China could be swept up in enforcement action, is not valid, though he said he is open to amending the bill to make that more clear. “There is a very legitimate national security concern here,” Yen said. “So I think it is something that regulators do need to tackle and this is why Congress is trying do something. But I think we need to do it in a way that doesn’t undermine the values of freedom and democracy that make America different from China.” Still, a TikTok ban would have other effects in the U.S., like yielding more market share to existing tech giants in the U.S. like Meta’s Facebook and Instagram. Proton has been an active proponent of antitrust reform to create what some companies see as a more level playing field for tech developers in the U.S. Yen said the solution to creating more competitive digital markets in the U.S. is not to allow risky Chinese companies to run rampant, but rather “to have a level playing field that can allow other American companies or European companies to compete in the U.S. fairly.” That’s a goal shared by Jonathan Ward, an expert on China who founded the Atlas Organization consulting firm. “The best way that we can do this is to create alternatives,” Ward said. “Because even if these companies don’t take root in our own market, even if we’re able to successfully deny them access here, as we did with Huawei, they can flourish in other parts of the world,” he added, referring to the Chinese telecom company that’s been placed on a U.S. entity list over national security concerns. “We’re also going to have to stand up American and free world alternatives to these companies because you can’t let them take over industries that matter or create apps that become integral to the fabric of our societies,” Ward said. “And that’s going to require an effort that goes beyond the Congress and into the sort of entire system of democracies worldwide.” "
'The Little Mermaid' makes box office splash with $95.5 million opening,Associated Press,"May 29, 2023, 8:46 PM UTC",News,"LOS ANGELES — “The Little Mermaid” made moviegoers want to be under the sea on Memorial Day weekend. Disney’s live-action remake of its 1989 animated classic easily outswam the competition, bringing in $95.5 million on 4,320 screens in North America, according to studio estimates Sunday. And Disney estimates the film starring Halle Bailey as the titular mermaid Ariel and Melissa McCarthy as her sea witch nemesis Ursula will reach $117.5 million by the time the holiday is over. It ranks as the fifth biggest Memorial Day weekend opening ever. It displaces “Fast X” in the top spot. The 10th installment in the “Fast and Furious” franchise starring Vin Diesel has lagged behind more recent releases in the series, bringing in $23 million domestically for a two-week total of $108 million for Universal Pictures. In its fourth weekend, Disney and Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” made an estimated $20 million in North America to take third place. It’s now made $299 million domestically. The performance of “The Little Mermaid” represents something of a bounce-back for Disney’s animated-to-live-action remakes, and makes it likely they will keep coming indefinitely. Poor reception and the pandemic had some recent reboots either performing poorly or skipping theatrical releases for Disney +, including “Dumbo,” “Mulan” and “Pinocchio.” “It works as long as the movies deliver,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “It’s great for Disney to be able to go to their archive by reviving these titles that started off as huge hits in the animated realm.” The opening puts it in the top tier of Disney’s remakes, with a similar performance to 2019′s “Aladdin,” though it was well short of 2017′s “Beauty and the Beast,” which opened to more than $170 million, and 2019′s “The Lion King,” which brought in more than $190 million in its first weekend. Audiences thought it delivered. The film had an A CinemaScore, and according to exit polling had more ticket buyers between ages 25 and 34 than children, suggesting nostalgic adults were essential. “The multi generational component of this cannot be overstated,” Dergarabedian said. Critics were more lukewarm. The movie is currently at 67% on Rotten Tomatoes. In her review, Lindsey Bahr of The Associated Press called it “a somewhat drab undertaking with sparks of bioluminescence” that like too many of the Disney remakes “prioritized nostalgia and familiarity over compelling visual storytelling.” She said Bailey, half of the sister R&B duo Chloe x Halle, still shone with a “lovely presence” and “superb voice.” Directed by Rob Marshall with a reported budget of $250 million before marketing, “The Little Mermaid” tells the story of a yearning, wayward daughter who cuts a devil’s deal to swap her fins for a pair of legs. It features the songs from Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, including “Part of Your World” and “Under the Sea,” that helped the original film spark a Disney animation renaissance in the 1990s. Fourth place went to Universal’s “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which keeps reaching new levels in its eighth weekend. Now available to rent on VOD, it still earned $6.3 million in theatres. Its cumulative total of $559 million makes Mario and Luigi the year’s biggest earners so far. Comics couldn’t stand up to Ariel as the week’s other new releases sank. “The Machine,” an action comedy starring stand—up comedian Bert Kreischer, finished fifth with $4.9 million domestically. And “About My Father,” the broad comedy starring stand-up Sebastian Maniscalco and Robert De Niro, was sixth with $4.3 million. It’s not clear whether “The Little Mermaid” will have legs — or fins — going forward. Next week brings the release of animated “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” with “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” arriving the following week. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. "
Why are streaming services removing some of their own movies and shows?,"Sarah Whitten, CNBC","May 29, 2023, 2:04 PM UTC",News,"Streaming was supposed to be forever. That was the promise of a digital library of movies and TV shows. Consumers got used to Netflix cycling through titles, aware that as Hollywood studios launched their own streaming services, proprietary content would transition to a new platform. Even when Warner Bros. Discovery pulled content as part of planned tax write-offs tied to its merger, consumers seemed to accept the move as the cost of doing business. However, as Disney is set to yank dozens of shows and films from Disney+ and Hulu, including “Willow,” “The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers” and “The Mysterious Benedict Society,” subscribers are suddenly faced with a new reality. “At first I expected any show that was on a streaming platform would stay on that platform,” said Conrad Burton, 35, an account manager at a transportation company in Raleigh, North Carolina. “But then I started noticing things expiring.” After the initial bloom of new platforms and subscriber growth, aided by pandemic lockdowns and a surge of fresh content, the digital streaming industry has cooled. And Wall Street has turned up the heat on media companies, now focusing on if and when streaming will be profitable versus if those providers are putting up big subscriber numbers. The change came last year after Netflix reported its first subscriber loss in a decade. “What is hitting their income statements is the amortization of content that’s already been made and released,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson. “Warner Bros. Discovery was the first one to figure this out, so we have to give credit where it’s due. They said they need to get their earnings up, so they started taking shows off the app. Disney is now doing that and we should expect Paramount to follow suit. And one day Netflix may even do the same thing.” It’s been difficult for consumers to understand why content made specifically for streaming platforms has been removed, especially when Netflix originals remain untouched in its library. “From a consumer standpoint, what they want is they want to be able to always have access to their content,” said Dan Rayburn, a media and streaming analyst. “The part that really confuses consumers is because they don’t understand how content is licensed,” he said. “They do get confused when one day content is on a service and then disappears or the content is still in the service, but it’s only X number of seasons.” Removing content from platforms is a way for streamers to avoid residual payments and licensing fees. “Much like syndication of Hollywood’s yesteryear, streaming services must pay for the right to host a title,” explained Brandon Katz, an industry strategist at Parrot Analytics. He noted that if a title is not owned by the streamer, then a licensing fee must be paid to the studio that owns that content. For example, Hulu licenses “The Handmaid’s Tale” from MGM Television. Even titles that are owned in-house must be licensed. That’s why NBCUniversal (the parent company of CNBC and NBC News) had to pay itself $500 million to stream Universal TV’s “The Office” on Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery paid $425 million for the streaming rights to the WBTV-produced “Friends.” “The balance sheet must reflect that,” Katz said. By removing the content specifically made for streaming rather than licensed shows and movies, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney can immediately cut expenses. Warner Bros. Discovery saved “tens of millions of dollars” after eliminating content, CNBC previously reported. The studio’s removal of movies and TV shows began last summer, initially with titles such as the “Sesame Street” spinoff “The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo” and teen drama “Generation.” But in the ensuing months, more and more original HBO and Max content was removed. Most notably, the sci-fi dramas “Westworld” and “Raised By Wolves” disappeared. “In my opinion, it discourages subscribers from checking out future original content,” said Matt Cartelli, 33, from New York state’s Hudson Valley. “Streaming used to be seen as a safe haven for consumers who were sick and tired of seeing shows canceled on traditional TV. Now streamers are following suit by canceling their own underperformers.” Cartelli was especially disappointed when he learned Disney+ initially planned to remove “Howard,” about a songwriter whose work was heard in Disney films such as the animated “The Little Mermaid.” Disney reversed its decision about that title after facing backlash on social media. And streamers have a fine line to walk. “The risk is with the writers’ strike,” Nathanson said. “If it continues for awhile, then they will rely on library content. If there’s nothing on there, churn will only get worse.” Streaming services are being strategic about what sticks around and what leaves their platforms. Major hits such as Max’s “Peacemaker” or Disney’s “The Mandalorian” are unlikely to be pulled from their respective apps. Meanwhile, underperforming shows and films could be on the chopping block. In the first quarter of the year, the demand for the dozens of shows and movies being cut from Disney+ represented only 1.9% of the total Disney+ catalog, according to data from Parrot Analytics. For comparison, “The Mandalorian” accounted for 1.3% of total demand during the same period. Similarly, the removed titles for Hulu accounted for just 0.4% of demand on the streaming service. And these titles aren’t lost forever. Soon after cutting programs from Max, Warner Bros. Discovery began licensing the content to Fox Corp.’s Tubi and Roku, which are free, ad-supported streaming television platforms — also known as FAST — allowing it to bring in a new source of revenue for the content. As media companies have been desperate to make streaming profitable, the businesses have been turning more and more to new advertising strategies, from cheaper, ad-supported offerings to putting content on FAST channels. “My main takeaway is that nothing is guaranteed to remain on streaming forever. You are paying for a convenient way to watch content, but it is not a replacement for buying a movie or TV show on home video,” Cartelli said. "
"Google searches questioning sexuality and gender up 1,300% since 2004, analysis shows",Isabela Espadas Barros Leal,"May 24, 2023, 9:59 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Google searches by users for phrases questioning their own sexuality and gender identity — including “Am I gay” and “Am I lesbian” — have increased by 1,300% since 2004, according to a new analysis. The findings were published last week by the Cultural Currents Institute, a market research firm that studies public opinion trends, which collected Google Trends data from January 2004 to this month for questions related to sexual orientation and gender identity across all 50 states. Utah emerged as the state with the highest search volume for the phrases “Am I gay,” “Am I lesbian” and “Am I trans” since last May, according to the report. It pointed to Utah’s “traditionally conservative social values” as a potentially significant factor in the data. “This might indicate a significant underlying questioning of identity among its internet users, possibly driven by the conflict between personal feelings and societal expectations,” the reports said. “These tensions between public life and web searches are common in Utah, where we recently shared data indicating that searches for ‘VPN’ surged after the website PornHub blocked the state.” Oklahoma had the highest search volume for the phrase “How to come out” over the past year, followed by West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana and Kentucky. Oklahoma, West Virginia, Mississippi and Louisiana were in the lowest LGBTQ equality category in the 2022 State Equality Index published by the Human Rights Campaign, the country’s largest LGBTQ group. Kentucky was in the second-lowest of the four categories measuring equality. Historical search volume for the term “nonbinary” was limited but gaining search traction, according to the report. Vermont was the state with the highest search volume for the term since last May. "
Jack Dorsey shares Robert F. Kennedy Jr. video echoing conspiracy theories,Ben Goggin,"May 24, 2023, 8:20 PM UTC",Internet,"Jack Dorsey, the head of Block Inc. and a co-founder of Twitter, posted two videos in the past week featuring presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has attracted criticism for his history of sharing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about vaccines. Kennedy has also discussed conspiracy theories about the killing of then-President John F. Kennedy and about his father. One post linked to a podcast interview from 2020 of Kennedy discussing numerous conspiracy theories with former boxing heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. On Tuesday, in a post made via Nostr, a technology that he has helped fund, Dorsey shared a 2020 interview with Kennedy, in which he promoted the conspiracy theory that the CIA killed both his father, Robert F. Kennedy, and JFK and espoused unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about vaccines, including that potential vaccine side effects are part of a profit plan for the pharmaceutical industry. The posts do not explicitly endorse Kennedy. The posts come as social networks appear poised to play a major role in the 2024 election cycle. On Tuesday, NBC News reported that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would announce his presidential primary bid on Twitter in an audio event with CEO Elon Musk, who has openly supported conservatives on the platform. Shortly before the post sharing the interview, Dorsey shared a link to a speech from JFK. He later posted on Nostr and Twitter, ""Splinter the CIA, NSA, and FBI into a thousand pieces and scatter them into the winds,"" along with an image of the assassinated president. On May 6, Dorsey shared a link to Kennedy's podcast on Bluesky, another app that uses technology backed by Dorsey. Dorsey did not respond to requests for comment sent through email and direct messages. In April, Kennedy announced his 2024 presidential bid as a Democratic candidate. April surveys from Emerson and Fox News found Kennedy's support at 19% and 21% in the Democratic primary, trailing President Joe Biden substantially but garnering a significant base of support. Prominent members of his own family, however, are not supporting his bid. Dorsey's support would lend another notable name to Kennedy's campaign. Dorsey has in the past supported other unconventional Democratic candidates, donating $5,600 to Tulsi Gabbard and $6,600 to Andrew Yang in 2019, according to the campaign finance website Open Secrets. Kennedy has found a warm reception among some far-right luminaries, including Steve Bannon, who briefly served as a top aide to former President Donald Trump and now hosts a prominent right-wing talk show, and Infowars host Alex Jones. This week, ahead of Dorsey's posts, Kennedy appeared as a keynote speaker at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami. Dorsey has been a major proponent of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, and his companies or ventures he's backed made numerous product announcements and appearances at the conference. Dorsey also shared numerous posts promoting the conference over the last week, including a video of Kennedy's speech. In 2019, Dorsey recorded a podcast with a media personality known for making anti-vaccine statements. "
"Social media is driving teen mental health crisis, surgeon general warns",Erika Edwards,"May 23, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Health news,"Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, long a proponent of mental health awareness, has issued a warning that social media use is a main contributor to depression, anxiety and other problems in the nation's teenagers. The report, released Tuesday, calls attention to growing concerns about the effects of social media use on children and adolescent's mental health. The advisory urges policymakers and the companies that make the social media platforms to share with parents the burden of managing children's and adolescents’ social media use. Murthy calls youth mental health “the defining public health issue of our time,” urging policymakers to help ensure strong safety standards to help protect adolescents and teens from exposure to harmful content and excessive use. Up to 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 say they use a social media platform, according to the report. About a third say they're scrolling, posting or otherwise engaged with social media ""almost constantly."" ""At this point, we do not have enough evidence to say with confidence that social media is sufficiently safe for our kids, Murthy said in an interview. ""We have to now take action to make sure that we are protecting our kids."" The report pulls together research that links social media use and poor mental health in adolescents, such as a 2019 study that found teens who spent more than three hours a day on social media ""faced double the risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes, including symptoms of depression and anxiety."" As of last year, students in grades eight and 10 who were surveyed said they spent even more time each day on these platforms: three hours and 30 minutes, on average. Jim Steyer, founder of Common Sense Media, an organization that advocates for laws and policies to make media more child-friendly, said the advisory was ""absolutely spot on"" and ""should be a clarion call to every parent in this country, every policymaker, that we need to put focus and resources into this effort."" The most popular social media platforms among teens are TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram, according to the Pew Research Center. The surgeon general's warning about social media comes as the rates of teenage depression, sadness and hopelessness have skyrocketed over the past decade, especially among girls. ""Teen depression started to rise around 2012, a time that coincides with the popularity of smartphones,"" said Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and the author of ""Generations: The Real Differences between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers and Silents—and What They Mean for America’s Future."" It was also a time, Twenge said, that ""'likes' on posts became common, and the algorithms started to become more sophisticated to keep people on social media for longer. That's clearly not a coincidence."" The surgeon general's report also blamed social media for perpetuating eating disorders, body dysmorphia and low self-esteem. Some evidence also suggests a possible link between excessive social media use and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in teens. Twenge said social media can affect mental health in a variety of ways. Both sleep and face-to-face social interaction are beneficial to mental health, she said, but if kids are online when they should be in bed or spending time with friends, that's a problem. Feeling left out and comparing oneself to others can also be damaging. ""Even if you know on an intellectual level that they may have taken 200 selfies to get the right one,"" Twenge said, ""at an emotional level, that's not really processed."" The surgeon general's report outlines recommendations for both technology companies and lawmakers. ""Policymakers need to step up and help ensure that we have strong safety standards, to help protect our kids from exposure to harmful content, and to also protect them from excessive use,"" Murthy said. This includes enforcing age minimums. Companies are advised to create better tools to protect teenagers, and loosen up on features that entice kids to stay online longer. It's parents who are on the front lines now in trying to help teens navigate the online world. The report encourages caregivers to create ""tech-free"" zones in the home, and to talk with kids about how social media use makes them feel. ""It's really not fair to put the onus on parents alone. Why isn't the industry held responsible for creating the platforms and making the features that much more addictive?"" Steyer of Common Sense Media said. ""There has to be a major national discussion."" Most tech companies require users to be at least 13 years old. But nearly 40% of kids between the ages of 8 and 12 use social media, the report said. Murthy said he believes even 13 is too young to be on social media but said there wasn't enough data to suggest which age would be appropriate. Twenge suggested that the age minimum should be set at 16. ""Let's get some regulations in place now to help kids who are not yet on social media,"" Twenge said. ""Maybe we can save the next generation."" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
Fake picture of explosion at Pentagon spooks Twitter,Ben Collins,"May 22, 2023, 9:20 PM UTC",Misinformation,"A fake image purporting to show an explosion near the Pentagon briefly went viral on Twitter on Monday, leaving fact-checkers to scramble to counter the false claim as it was pushed by a variety of verified accounts. The image, which depicts a large plume of smoke next to a rectangular building with only a passing resemblance to the Pentagon, was shared by a series of verified news and open-source intelligence Twitter accounts. As of late April, verified users on Twitter are people who have paid $8 per month for the company’s “Blue” subscription service, which gives users a blue check mark along with some other perks, but the service no longer confirms the user’s identity. The image appears to have first been shared on Twitter by an account with the handle @CBKNews121 at 8:42 a.m. ET. That account, which is verified, includes a variety of iconography associated with conspiracy theories, including John F. Kennedy Jr. as its profile picture. QAnon believers falsely claim John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his own death and will run for vice president with Donald Trump in 2024. Shortly after posting the image, CBKNews posted a tweet supporting QAnon. “Watch #ElonMusk for the next 60 days. Q. Big,” the account tweeted. CBKNews did not respond to a request for comment on Twitter and later deleted the Pentagon explosion tweet. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, which is based out of the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy at the University of Toronto, tweeted that the image showed signs of having been generated by artificial intelligence. Before it was deleted, the image took on a life of its own. RT, Russia’s official propaganda outlet, tweeted at 10:03 a.m. ET about “reports of an explosion near the Pentagon.” A business news aggregation influencer with over 650,000 followers on Twitter who is best known for posting Bloomberg News headlines posted about a “Large Explosion near The Pentagon Complex” at 10:06 a.m. That account later deleted the tweet, but not until after racking up hundreds of retweets. The spread of the tweet appeared to spook some investors. The S&P 500 dropped sharply in the minutes after the image was amplified by well-followed accounts. It later recovered those losses. Shortly after that tweet, the anonymous Wall Street news blog ZeroHedge posted the fake Pentagon explosion image to the account’s 1.6 million followers, along with the caption “EXPLOSION NEAR PENTAGON.” ZeroHedge later deleted the tweet. By this point, fake news organizations on Twitter that had purchased “verified” check marks began to push the hoax. The account @BloombergFeed, which is unaffiliated with Bloomberg, posted the conspiracy theory minutes later. That account has since been suspended by Twitter. Around 10:27 a.m. ET, the Arlington, Virginia, fire department tweeted that “there is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon.” Nick Waters, an investigator at the digital investigations firm Bellingcat, told NBC News that the panic around the image “never made any sense.” “There are quite a few red flags in this picture,” Waters said. “When you try to actually place this picture in space and geolocate it, you can’t because it’s not a real place. It’s not a building that’s anywhere in Washington authentically.” Waters also noted that the fences in front of the fake building morph and meld into one another. After the fake Pentagon image went viral Monday morning, a copycat hoaxer pushed a similar image of the White House on fire. Waters noted that the image didn’t take off in quite the same way the Pentagon image did, in part because “it didn’t look anything like the White House.” “AI is still really not great at producing accurate locations, and you can really tell that from the picture,” Waters said.

Montana banned TikTok. Creators in the state are bracing for what’s next.,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 19, 2023, 7:36 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"At first, Montana-based TikTok creators weren’t worried about a potential ban on the app in the state. But when Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a bill restricting downloads of the immensely popular social media app into law, the fear — and frustration — set in. “It feels like it’s just one step closer to losing our freedom and the freedom that Montanans value so highly,” said Spencre McGowan, a content creator based in Butte who has more than 109,000 followers. She’s among the countless content creators in the state who will be impacted when the bill, SB 419, goes into effect in January 2024. The legislation makes it illegal for app stores to give users the option to download TikTok and for the company to operate within the state. Violations of a ban include every time a user is offered the ability to download the app. Each violation could carry a $10,000 penalty. Enforcement would be handled by the Montana Justice Department. The ban is already facing a legal battle — on Wednesday, a group of five TikTokers sued the state, arguing the law is an unconstitutional violation of free speech rights. For creators like McGowan, who earn anywhere from $350 to $1,100 for her sponsored posts, the app has been a way to get their heads above water financially. While McGowan, author of the cookbook “Forest + Home,” has a part-time job creating content for the seaweed company Daybreak Seaweed, TikTok is where she makes cottagecore content and earns a decent income. “When I started getting paid and brands kept reaching out to me for my work as an herbalist and an artist and a cook, it just felt really special and meaningful,” she said. “And the finances are just such a helpful addition to my current paycheck.” Montana’s ban cites TikTok’s China-based owner ByteDance as the onus for prohibiting the platform. “The Chinese Communist Party using TikTok to spy on Americans, violate their privacy, and collect their personal, private, and sensitive information is well-documented,” Gianforte said in a news release, calling the law “the most decisive action of any state.” More than half the U.S. states and the federal government have banned TikTok from government-owned devices, according to The Associated Press. TikTok has attempted to persuade U.S. officials that they can address security concerns and meet the level of proposed scrutiny. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew told Congress in March that 150 million people in the U.S. are regular users of the app, which has exploded in popularity in recent years. Montana’s blanket ban prevents our clients, and all Montanans, from engaging in protected speech -Ambika Kumar, lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Montana suit TikTok creators also held a press conference in Washington, D.C. in March after it was reported that the Biden administration was considering a nationwide ban of the app unless its owners sold their stock. This week, five Montana-based TikTok content creators — Samantha Alario, Heather DiRocco, Carly Ann Goddard, Alice Held and Dale Stout — filed a suit against the state, claiming the ban attempts to suppress speech and “exercises power over national security that Montana does not have.” The plaintiffs have used the app to help promote their businesses, connect with military veterans, share videos about ranch life and post humorous sketches. Attorneys for the plaintiffs did not make them immediately available for comment. “Montana’s blanket ban prevents our clients, and all Montanans, from engaging in protected speech,” said Ambika Kumar, lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Montana suit. Kumar previously won an injunction in 2020, when then-President Donald Trump attempted to ban TikTok. “We are determined to see that this misguided and invalid law is permanently enjoined,” Kumar said. In response to the suit, Emily Flower, spokeswoman for the Montana Department of Justice, said, “We expected a legal challenge and are fully prepared to defend the law.” McGowan said she feels the TikTok ban is another blow to Montanans’ freedoms, citing Montana’s recent ban on abortion after 15 weeks as another piece of legislation adding to her anxiety. (Montana’s abortion ban has temporarily been blocked by a judge). She also pointed to the treatment of transgender people in the state as a reason for her growing unease. While McGowan doesn’t have kids yet, she said these recent legislative changes have made her hesitant about raising a family in Montana. “Realistically, if trans health care is getting denied, if pregnant people are not treated as equals, and if we are not allowed to download an app … I’ve told my husband, I don’t want to raise our kids in a state that would allow that."" Montana may not be thought of as a bustling hub for creators and influencers, but it is still home to many who rely on the app for income and connection with the rest of the world. Among the most famous content creators living in Montana is Hank Green, a pillar of internet culture. Upon learning of the ban, Green responded by tweeting an angry emoji. Green did not respond to a request for comment. Country singer Jonah Prill, a native of Billings, said TikTok has been a crucial component to building his fan base. Prill, who has more than 809,000 followers, called it “the most useful, creative, best tool for me and my peers.” “This is incredible timing that this bill was introduced because I’m currently in the middle of releasing a song, and my biggest tool is TikTok,” Prill said. Although Prill recently moved to Nashville for his music career, he said TikTok remains an effective tool to connect with his fans in Montana and around the world — especially ahead of the release of his upcoming song “All That Pretty.” Prill said he hopes Montana residents won’t lose access to an app that he believes has tremendous power for both businesses and individuals looking to connect with one another. “Honestly, we don’t have internet or cell reception in most of the state,” Prill joked. “However, it would be an absolute shame if the rest of the world or even someone from a neighboring state wouldn’t be able to necessarily have access to the beauty of the place and the amazing people of Montana.” "
"Twitter accuses Microsoft of misusing its data, foreshadowing a fight over AI",Associated Press,"May 19, 2023, 2:53 PM UTC",Tech News,"SAN FRANCISCO — A lawyer for Twitter owner Elon Musk accused Microsoft of misusing the service’s data and demanded an audit from the software giant. The letter primarily addresses a seemingly narrow set of alleged infractions by Microsoft in drawing information from Twitter’s database of tweets. But the move could foreshadow more serious developments. Musk has previously accused Microsoft and its partner OpenAI in a tweet of “illegally” using Twitter data to develop sophisticated AI systems such as ChatGPT. “ Lawsuit time,” Musk wrote in that April tweet. But the letter, signed by Musk lawyer Alex Spiro, tiptoed around that concern. It noted that Microsoft’s agreement with Twitter barred it from overuse of the service’s data such as exceeding “reasonable request volume” or “excessive or abusive usage.” Spiro then noted that “despite these limitations,” Microsoft had retrieved more than 26 billion tweets in 2022 alone. He provided no context for those numbers. The process of training AI systems requires enormous amounts of data such as written text, which AI algorithms scour for patterns that the AI can use to make sense of language and large bodies of knowledge. In other respects, the letter primarily laid out a series of vaguely worded allegations. For instance, it noted that while Microsoft was required to inform Twitter about its intended use of the data, it failed to do so for six of the eight Microsoft apps that drew on information from the Twitter database. Similarly, the letter asserted that at least one Microsoft app had supplied Twitter data to a number of virtual locations that “reference a government entity or agency.” That apparently violated Microsoft’s agreement with Twitter, the letter stated, which prohibited the company from retrieving Twitter data “on behalf of ‘any government-related entity’” without first notifying Twitter. The letter stated that Microsoft had failed to provide such notification. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw provided a statement noting that Microsoft will review questions raised by the letter and then will “respond appropriately.” The statement added that “we look forward to continuing our long term partnership” with Twitter, which it did not refer to by name. Shaw declined to address specifics from the letter. Spiro’s letter demanded that Microsoft describe in detail the Twitter data it possesses or has previously destroyed, the purpose for each of its apps that drew on Twitter information, and any government entities that used these Microsoft apps and whether they received data from Twitter’s database.

Supreme Court sidesteps ruling on scope of internet companies' immunity from lawsuits over user content,Lawrence Hurley,"May 18, 2023, 2:29 PM UTC / Updated May 18, 2023, 7:32 PM UTC",Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court sidestepped a ruling Thursday on the legal shield that protects internet companies from lawsuits relating to content posted by users in a case concerning allegations that YouTube was liable for suggesting videos promoting violent militant Islam. In a brief unsigned opinion, the court did not decide the legal question of whether liability protections enshrined in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act safeguard YouTube’s alleged conduct. That is because, in a related case involving similar allegations against Twitter, the court ruled unanimously Thursday that such claims could not be brought in the first place under a federal law called the Anti-Terrorism Act. As a result, both the YouTube and the Twitter lawsuits are likely to be dismissed without courts' needing to address the Section 230 issues. ""This is a huge win for free speech on the internet. The court was asked to undermine Section 230 — and declined,"" said Chris Marchese, a lawyer at NetChoice, a trade group for tech corporations. The YouTube lawsuit accused the company of bearing some responsibility for the killing of Nohemi Gonzalez, an American college student, in the 2015 Paris attacks carried out by the Islamic State terrorist group. In the Twitter case, the company was accused of aiding and abetting the spread of militant Islamist ideology in way that contributed to the death of a Jordanian citizen in a terrorist attack. The justices found in that case that relatives of Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in Istanbul in 2017, cannot pursue claims that Twitter, Google and Facebook were liable for aiding and abetting the attack under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Because of that decision, Gonzalez's family is unlikely to be able to pursue its claim. As a result, there is no need for courts to address the Section 230 immunity question. The unsigned decision said the allegations were “materially identical to those at issue” in the Twitter case. As a result of that ruling, ""it appears to follow that the complaint here likewise fails to state a claim,"" the court said. ""We therefore decline to address the application of Section 230 to a complaint that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief,"" the court added. Hannah DeLaine Prado, the general counsel for YouTube owner Google, said in a statement that the various entities that backed Section 230 would be ""reassured by this result."" Eric Schnapper, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in both cases, declined to comment. The tech industry is closely watching the YouTube case because recommendations are now the norm for online services in general, not just YouTube. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and Twitter long ago began to rely on recommendation engines or algorithms to decide what people see most of the time, rather than emphasize chronological feeds. Potential reform of Section 230 is one area in which President Joe Biden and some of his most ardent Republican critics are in agreement, although they disagree on why and how it should be done. Conservatives generally claim that companies are inappropriately censoring content, while liberals say social media companies are spreading dangerous right-wing rhetoric and not doing enough to stop it. Although the Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority, it had not been clear how it would approach the issue. Gonzalez, 23, was studying in France when she was killed while dining at a restaurant during the wave of terrorist attacks carried out by ISIS. Her family alleges that YouTube helped ISIS spread its message. The lawsuit targets YouTube’s use of algorithms to suggest videos for users based on content they have previously viewed. YouTube’s active role goes beyond the kind of conduct Congress intended to protect with Section 230, the family’s lawyers allege. The family filed the lawsuit in 2016 in federal court in Northern California, and it hopes to pursue claims that YouTube violated the Anti-Terrorism Act, which allows people to sue people or entities who “aid and abet” terrorist acts. Citing Section 230, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in a June 2021 decision that also resolved similar cases that families of other terrorist attack victims had brought against tech companies — including the Twitter dispute. In the Twitter case, Alassaf was visiting Istanbul with his wife when he and 38 other people were killed by ISIS-affiliated Abdulkadir Masharipov in the Reina nightclub. Masharipov had created a “martyrdom” video saying he was inspired by ISIS and wished to die in a suicide attack. He evaded capture after the shootings but was later arrested and convicted. Alassaf’s family asserted that without the active assistance of Twitter, Facebook and Google, ISIS’ message and related recruiting efforts would not have spread so widely. The family does not allege that Twitter actively sought to aid ISIS. A federal judge had dismissed the lawsuit, but the 9th Circuit in the same decision addressing the YouTube case said that the aiding and abetting claim could move forward. The family adequately alleged that the companies had provided substantial assistance to ISIS, the court concluded. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in Thursday's ruling that the family's ""allegations are insufficient to establish that these defendants aided and abetted ISIS in carrying out the relevant attack."" Thomas said aiding and abetting must constitute ""a conscious, voluntary, and culpable participation in another's wrongdoing,"" which the plaintiffs had failed to show. Twitter’s lawyers argued that it provides the same generic services for all its users and actively tries to prevent terrorists from using them. A ruling against the company could have allowed lawsuits against many entities that provide widely available goods or services, including humanitarian groups, the lawyers said. David Greene, the civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that advocates for free speech online, welcomed the Twitter ruling, saying the court correctly found that ""an online service cannot be liable for terrorist attacks merely because their services are generally used by terrorist organizations the same way they are used by millions of organizations around the globe."" Twitter's media office, as is customary, automatically replied to a request for comment with a poop emoji. "
ChatGPT creator releases iPhone app in step toward broader consumer appeal,David Ingram,"May 18, 2023, 6:10 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"SAN FRANCISCO — The creator of ChatGPT is rolling out an app to bring the artificial intelligence chatbot to smartphones. OpenAI, the startup that released ChatGPT to wide attention last year, released a free app Thursday for the iOS operating system, which runs on Apple devices including iPhones and iPads. The move represents the latest push by the company to broaden the consumer appeal of artificial intelligence. ""Since the release of ChatGPT, we've heard from users that they love using ChatGPT on the go,"" the company said in a blog post. ""With the ChatGPT app for iOS, we're taking another step towards our mission by transforming state-of-the-art research into useful tools that empower people, while continuously making them more accessible,"" the company added. OpenAI has gradually been adding other features to ChatGPT. On Friday, the company said it was allowing some customers to test out a version that connects to the real-time internet to answer questions about recent topics and events. Previously, the chatbot had very limited access to events and knowledge after 2021. Before Thursday's app release, ChatGPT was already available via web browsers, but the app may help OpenAI appeal to consumers who are used to spending time in dedicated apps rather than the open web. The app may also help OpenAI fend off competition. The Apple app store already has numerous AI chatbots that say they are powered by similar OpenAI technology. OpenAI, founded as a nonprofit in 2015 by several tech billionaires, is privately held and has a close partnership with Microsoft. The iOS app was immediately available in the United States and will expand to additional countries in the coming weeks, OpenAI said. An app for Android devices was also in the works, the company said. OpenAI has been at the center of attention as well as criticism for its decision in November to release what was considered the world's most advanced chatbot, a decision that has begun to upend areas of society including education, screenwriting and online search. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told a Senate committee in testimony Tuesday that the U.S. should require companies to be licensed by the government if they want to develop powerful artificial intelligence systems because of the rapid advancement of a technology with hard-to-measure risks.

College instructor put on blast for accusing students of using ChatGPT on final assignments,Uwa Ede-Osifo,"May 18, 2023, 2:00 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Texas A&M University–Commerce said it is investigating after a screenshot of an instructor's email — in which he accused students of having used artificial intelligence on their final assignments — went viral on Reddit. Jared Mumm, an instructor in the agricultural sciences and natural resources department, reportedly told students that they would be receiving an “X” in the course after he used ""Chat GTP"" (referring to the AI chatbot actually known as ChatGPT) to determine whether they’d used the software to write their final assignments. He said that he tested each paper twice and that the bot claimed to have written every single final assignment. “I copy and paste your responses in [ChatGPT] and [it] will tell me if the program generated the content,” according to the email, a copy of which NBC News has reviewed. Rolling Stone first reported the story. Attempts to reach Mumm by email, LinkedIn and phone were unsuccessful Wednesday. A university spokesperson confirmed Mumm sent the email. The screenshot was shared Monday in the subreddit r/ChatGPT, a community made up of 1.6 million users. Many blasted him, and others came to his defense, noting that AI is still a very new tool. The discussion reignited debate around the impact chatbots could have on education. After its viral launch in December, ChatGPT was lauded online by some as a dramatic step forward for artificial intelligence and the potential future of web search. But with such praise also came concern about its potential use in academic settings. In January, the New York City Education Department announced a ban on ChatGPT from its schools’ devices and networks, citing the potential for increased student cheating. A university spokesperson rebutted parts of the Reddit post, which claimed “Texas A&M commerce professor fails entire class of seniors blocking them from graduating- claiming they all use ‘Chat GTP’” No students flunked or were prevented from graduating because of the issue, the spokesperson said. ""Dr. Jared Mumm, the class professor, is working individually with students regarding their last written assignments,"" the university said in its statement. ""Some students received a temporary grade of ‘X’—which indicates ‘incomplete’—to allow the professor and students time to determine whether AI was used to write their assignments and, if so, at what level."" The spokesperson said that since the email was posted on Reddit, ""several students have been exonerated and their grades have been issued, while one student has come forward admitting his use of Chat GTP in the course. Several other students have opted to complete a new writing assignment made available to them by Dr. Mumm."" The Reddit post was shared by a user named DearKick, who claimed to have obtained the email from their fiancé, a student in the class. Hundreds of people responded in the comments. A user suggested that there ""be an AI introductory class that is mandatory for teachers and everyone else to understand the biases of AI and how it functions."" Another took the criticism a step further and suggested the instructor should face disciplinary action from the university. “I know several university lecturers that are actively embracing the reality of ChatGPT and other AI and are looking at how to increase the learning potential that can be gained while finding better ways of analysing students skills and capabilities,” wrote another user. “This all reminds me of the time we were told that calculators would never be allowed in classrooms and, god forbid, in exams, only to be proved wrong the following year.” AI technology is already being used to help detect plagiarism. Many students have long used computer-assisted writing tools, such as Grammarly or Google Docs’ Smart Compose. Platforms like Grammarly and Chegg also offer plagiarism-checking tools. In April, Turnitin, a plagiarism detection service, announced it will activate its AI writing detection capabilities to ""help educators and academic institutions identify AI-generated text in student-written submissions."" The Texas A&M University–Commerce spokesperson said the school will work to ""develop policies to address the use or misuse of AI technology in the classroom."" Officials also plan to use AI detection tools. ""The use of AI in coursework is a rapidly changing issue that confronts all learning institutions,"" the spokesperson said. "
DOJ charges former Apple engineer with theft of autonomous car tech for China,"Rohan Goswami, CNBC","May 17, 2023, 2:29 PM UTC",Security,"A former Apple software engineer was charged with stealing Apple’s autonomous technology for a Chinese self-driving car company, the Department of Justice announced Tuesday. Weibao Wang worked as a software engineer at Apple from 2016 to 2018, a DOJ indictment said. Wang worked on Apple’s Annotation Team and was granted “broad access” to databases which the Justice Department said could only be accessed by 2,700 of Apple’s 135,000 employees. Wang is the third former Apple employee to be accused of stealing autonomous trade secrets for China. Wang has been charged with six separate counts involving the theft or attempted theft of Apple’s “entire autonomy source code,” tracking systems, behavior planning for autonomous systems, and descriptions of the hardware that was behind the systems. A year into his employment, four months before he quit his job at Apple, Wang accepted a job at the U.S.-based subsidiary of an unnamed Chinese company that was developing autonomous driving technology and he began to siphon “large amounts” of sensitive commercial technology and source code, the indictment alleges. In April 2017, only 5,000 of Apple’s 135,000 full-time employees had been informed about the project, the DOJ indictment alleges, or around 4% of the company. An even smaller segment, around 2%, had access to “one or more” of the databases Wang accessed, the indictment continues. Law enforcement executed a search of Wang’s home in California on June 27, 2018, where they found large quantities of stolen, confidential, and proprietary data, the indictment alleges. Wang was able to flee the country even after law enforcement executed the search, despite promising that he wouldn’t. Wang boarded a flight to Guangzhou, China, from San Francisco International Airport. In a press conference, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California Ismail Ramsey said Wang is in China and would face 10 years in prison for each count if extradited and convicted. The charges were announced as part of a sweeping enforcement action led by the Disruptive Technology Strike Force. Four other cases were unveiled across the United States, involving criminal behavior to supply Iranian forces with sensitive ballistic technology, Russian intelligence and research units with quantum technology, and sanctions-violating exports. The allegations against Wang come after another Apple employee, Xiaolang Zhang, pleaded guilty in San Jose federal court to a similar theft involving trade secrets in Apple’s car division. Like Wang, Zhang had planned to flee to China. Both Zhang and Wang were working at Apple’s autonomous division at the same time, and both left their employment at Apple in 2018. Another employee, Jizhong Chen, was also facing federal charges over his alleged 2019 theft of sensitive information. Chen also attempted to flee to China, according to court documents. Chen’s case is proceeding in California federal court. Apple declined to comment on the case. "
Inside ChatGPT: How AI chatbots work,JoElla Carman,"May 17, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",Data Graphics,"By now, you’ve heard of ChatGPT and its text generation capabilities. It has passed a business school exam, confounded teachers looking to spot cheaters and helped people craft emails to their co-workers and loved ones. That it has accomplished those tasks is notable, because exams, essays and emails require correct answers. But being correct isn’t really the point of ChatGPT — it’s more of a byproduct of its objective: producing natural-sounding text. So how do artificial intelligence chatbots work, and why do they get some answers right and some answers really, really wrong? Here’s a look inside the box. The technology behind large language models like ChatGPT is similar to the predictive text feature you see when you compose a message on your phone. Your phone will evaluate what has been typed in and calculate probabilities of what’s most likely to follow, based on its model and what it has observed from your past behavior. Anyone familiar with the process knows how many different directions a string of text can branch into. Unlike the phone’s predictive text feature, ChatGPT is said to be generative (the G in GPT). It isn’t making one-off predictions; instead it’s meant to create text strings that make sense across multiple sentences and paragraphs. The output is meant to make sense and read as though a person wrote it, and it should match up with the prompt. So what helps it pick a good next word, and then another word after that, and on and on? There is no database of facts or a dictionary inside the machine to help it “understand” words. Instead, the system treats words mathematically, as a collection of values. You can think of these values as representing some quality the word might have. For example, is the word complimentary or critical? Sweet or sour? Low or high? In theory, you could set these values wherever you like and find that you have come close to a word. Here is a fictional example to demonstrate the idea: The generator below is designed to return a different fruit based on the three qualities. Try changing any of the qualities to see how the output changes. That technique is called word embedding, and it isn’t new. It originated in the field of linguistics in the 1950s. While the example above uses just three “qualities,” in a large language model, the number of “qualities” for every word would be in the hundreds, allowing a very precise way to identify words. When the model is new, the qualities associated with each word are set randomly, which isn’t very useful, because its ability to predict depends on their being very finely tuned. To get there, it needs to be trained on a lot of content. That is the large part of the large language model. A system like ChatGPT might be fed millions of webpages and digital documents. (Think about the entirety of Wikipedia, big news websites, blogs and digitized books.) The machine cycles through the training data one stretch at a time, blocking out a word in a sequence and calculating a “guess” at what values most closely represent what should go in the blank. When the right answer is revealed, the machine can use the difference between what it guessed and the actual word to improve. It’s a lengthy process. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, hasn’t published the details about how much training data went into ChatGPT or the computer power used to train it, but researchers from Nvidia, Stanford University and Microsoft estimate that, using 1,024 graphics processing units, it would have taken 34 days to train GPT 3, ChatGPT’s predecessor. One analyst estimated that the cost of computational resources to train and run large language models could stretch into the millions. ChatGPT also has an extra layer of training, referred to as reinforcement learning from human feedback. While previous training is about getting the model to fill in missing text, this phase is about getting it to put out strings that are coherent, accurate and conversational. During this stage, people rate the machine’s response, flagging output that is incorrect, unhelpful or even downright nonsensical. Using the feedback, the machine learns to predict whether humans will find its responses useful. OpenAI says this training makes the output of its model safer, more relevant and less likely to “hallucinate” facts. And researchers have said it is what aligns ChatGPT’s responses better with human expectations. At the end of the process, there is no record of the original training data inside the model. It doesn’t contain facts or quotes that can be referred to — just how related or unrelated words were to one another in action. This set of data turns out to be surprisingly powerful. When you type your query into ChatGPT, it translates everything into numbers using what it learned during training. Then it does the same series of calculations from above to predict the next word in its response. This time, there’s no hidden word to reveal; it just predicts. Thanks to its ability to refer to earlier parts of the conversation, it can keep it up page after page of realistic, human-sounding text that is sometimes, but not always, correct. At this point, there are plenty of disagreements about what AI is or will be capable of, but one thing is pretty well agreed upon — and prominently featured on the interfaces of ChatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing: These tools shouldn’t be relied on when accuracy is required. Large language models are able to identify text patterns, not facts. And a number of models, including ChatGPT, have knowledge cutoff dates, which means they can’t connect to the internet to learn new information. That’s in contrast to Microsoft’s Bing chatbot, which can query online resources. A large language model is also only as good as the material that was used to train it. Because models identify patterns between words, feeding an AI text that is dangerous or racist means the AI will learn text patterns that are dangerous or racist. OpenAI says it has created some guardrails to prevent it from serving that up, and ChatGPT says it is “trained to decline inappropriate requests,” as we discovered when it refused to write an angry email demanding a raise. But the company also admits that ChatGPT will still sometimes “respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behavior.” There are many useful ways to take advantage of the technology now, such as drafting cover letters, summarizing meetings or planning meals. The big question is whether improvements in the technology can push past some of its flaws, enabling it to create truly reliable text. Graphics by JoElla Carman. In the “Pride and Prejudice” graphic, Google Bard, OpenAI GPT-1 and ChatGPT were given the prompt “Please summarize Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen in one sentence.” BigScience Bloom was asked to finish the sentence “In the novel Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen.” All responses collected May 11, 2023. In the email graphic, OpenAI ChatGPT was given the prompts: “Write a positive email asking for a raise,” “Write a neutral email asking for a raise,” “Write an agitated email asking for a raise,” “Write an angry email asking for a raise.” All responses collected May 8, 2023.

TikTok will pay content creators who make popular effects and filters,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 16, 2023, 11:34 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Some TikTok creators may soon get paid for creating filters and effects for the platform. The company on Tuesday announced the launch of a $6 million fund called TikTok’s Effect Creator Rewards, which will offer payments to users in selected regions who make ""high-performing effects."" Creators will be paid based on ""the community’s engagement with their effects,"" TikTok said in a blog post. They will be paid $700 for every effect that has been used in 500,000 unique videos within 90 days of being published. They can also earn $140 for every 100,000 videos published after the initial 500,000 within the same 90 days. TikTok last year launched Effect House, an augmented reality tool that allows users to create, publish and share dynamic effects. TikTok has previously used influencers to help create filters, Insider reported last year. Some creators who spoke with the publication said they hope to be better recognized for their work. “My hope for the future is that big companies or brands will start giving credit to AR filter creators when using our work, especially when they are monetizing from it,” Emma Sofija, who has made several viral randomized and gamified effects, told Insider in June. The fund is another opportunity for creators to monetize their presence on TikTok. In a July 2020 blog post, TikTok introduced its $200 million Creator Fund, which it said it expects will ""grow to over $1 billion in the US in the next 3 years."" But since then, many creators have complained that TikTok, a multibillion-dollar company, has been underpaying them. In January 2022, creators began going viral after they pointed out that the fund, which acted as a pool of money from which all eligible creators shared, was an outdated form of payment. “Literally, when TikTok becomes more successful, TikTokers become less successful,” YouTube and TikTok star Hank Green said at the time. TikTok has worked to add more monetization tools, like the Effect Creator Rewards and the Creativity Program Beta, a revamped version of its monetization tool, which launched in February. Those who want to join must have 10,000 followers and 100,000 authentic video views in the previous 30 days, TikTok said at the time. In its latest update on May 3, TikTok said the Creativity Program Beta remains ""in its early stages,"" noting the platform is ""continuously exploring ways to improve the experience for our creator community and the way creators are rewarded.""

Elon Musk says 'so be it' to consequences of his tweeting,David Ingram,"May 16, 2023, 11:27 PM UTC",Tech News,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk defended his promotion of conspiracy theories, called the work-from-home trend morally wrong and criticized the direction of tech startup OpenAI in a wide-ranging and at times combative interview Tuesday with CNBC. The hourlong interview touched on subjects from autonomous vehicles and online free speech to how much sleep Musk gets and whether some of his tweets are antisemitic — a reflection of his broad interests and influence as one of the world’s richest people. Musk said he wouldn’t stop sharing extremist views, even after a tweet hours earlier about fellow billionaire George Soros was widely condemned, including by the Israeli government. “I’ll say what I want to say, and if the consequence of doing that is losing money, so be it,” Musk told CNBC anchor David Faber in the interview, broadcast live from a Tesla facility in Texas. Musk’s public statements, especially on Twitter, which he owns, have increasingly veered into online conspiracy theories in recent weeks. He attacked Soros in several tweets Monday, saying that Soros “wants to erode the very fabric of civilization” and that he “hates humanity.” Musk compared Soros, who is a frequent target of anti-Jewish hatred, to Magneto, a fictional Jewish supervillain. Some Twitter users offered a theory for Musk’s motivation: Hours before the attacks, a fund Soros controls reported selling its shares in Tesla, of which Musk is CEO. The attack on Soros drew a swift and pointed denunciation from an official at Israel’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, David Saranga, who tweeted that Twitter was “filled with AntiSemitic conspiracies and hate speech targeting Jews around the world.” “Unfortunately Twitter does nothing to address this problem,” Saranga wrote. Musk alleged in other recent tweets that “elites” were falsifying examples of racial prejudice and that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg “bought” the 2020 election. Another tweet used a meme popular with white supremacists to try to explain the first two amendments to the Constitution. Musk told Faber that he stood by his tweets and that he is a “prosemite,” not an antisemite. “I think that’s true. That’s my opinion,” he said of his attack on Soros. Musk continued to insert himself into a discussion of the motives of a gunman who killed at least eight people at a mall in Texas this month. Although law enforcement officials have said the gunman was a suspected neo-Nazi sympathizer, Musk second-guessed them. “It should not be ascribed to white supremacy if it’s false,” he said. The interview occurred at a whirlwind time for Musk, one of the richest people in the world. On a business level, he recently hired a new CEO for Twitter, and his company SpaceX tested the most powerful rocket ever created. Tuesday was also the day of Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, where he promised to deliver the long-delayed Cybertruck. On a geopolitical level, he met Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron. Over the weekend, he waded into Turkish national elections when he complied with a government order there to censor the tweets of opponents to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. And on a personal level, authorities in the U.S. Virgin Islands said in a court filing Monday that they are seeking documents from Musk in connection with a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase of having helped to enable the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. All the while, Musk keeps popping up in celebrity news, with tabloid coverage of his visits to a Formula 1 race in Miami and a music festival in Cabo San Lucas on Mexico’s Pacific coast. Musk, asked about the upheaval at Twitter since he bought it for $44 billion last year, said some of his layoffs may have gone too far by cutting people he shouldn’t have. “Desperate times call for desperate measures,” he said. “We’re not quite at break-even yet, but we’re close. We need to do it fast. And if you do it fast, unfortunately, there’s gonna be some babies thrown out with the bathwater.” Faber asked Musk about an issue the tech industry and other office-based businesses are still wrestling with: how much flexibility there should be to work remotely. He said software engineers and others who have traditionally worked from offices should continue to do so, in part because blue-collar workers can’t work from home. “People who make your food that gets delivered — they can’t work from home. The people that come fix your house, they can't work from home, but you can? Does that seem morally right? That’s messed up,” he said. “You see it as a moral issue?” Faber asked. “Yes. It’s a productivity issue, but it’s also a moral issue,” Musk said. Musk said he remained upset about the direction of OpenAI, a company he helped to start as a nonprofit, open-source organization in 2015. Musk said he was instrumental in recruiting key scientists and even came up with the name. “It wouldn’t exist without me,” he said. “OpenAI was meant to be open, as in open-source.” Now, however, OpenAI is partly for-profit, and it closely guards much of its work, a shift that began in 2019 as it tried to compete with Google and other companies for talent. “It would be as if you started a nonprofit to save the Amazon rainforest and they transformed themselves into a lumber company,” he said. The interview was unusual in part because Musk rarely grants time to large news outlets, which he frequently criticizes as biased. Musk said he granted the interview at the recommendation of talent agent and public relations executive Ari Emanuel. “I’m not doing an interview with CNBC, the organization, I’m doing an interview with David Faber at Ari Emanuel’s recommendation,” Musk tweeted. “If David was at another news org, I would still do it.” CNBC is a part of NBCUniversal News Group, which also includes NBC News.

Apple’s next big iPhone update lets users create digital versions of their voices,"Rohan Goswami, CNBC","May 16, 2023, 8:25 PM UTC",Apple,"Ahead of its June WWDC event, Apple on Tuesday previewed a suite of accessibility features that will be coming “later this year” in its next big iPhone update. The new “Personal Voice” feature, expected as part of iOS 17, will let iPhones and iPads generate digital reproductions of a user’s voice for in-person conversations and on phone, FaceTime and audio calls. Apple said Personal Voice will create a synthesized voice that sounds like a user and can be used to connect with family and friends. The feature is aimed at users who have conditions that can affect their speaking ability over time. Users can create their Personal Voice by recording 15 minutes of audio on their device. Apple said the feature will use local machine-learning technology to maximize privacy. It’s part of a larger suite of accessibility improvements for iOS devices, including a new Assistive Access feature that helps users with cognitive disabilities, and their caretakers, more easily take advantage of iOS devices. Apple also announced another machine learning-backed technology, augmenting its existing Magnifier feature with a new point-and-speak-backed Detection Mode. The new functionality will combine Camera input, LiDAR input, and machine-learning technology to announce the text on the screen. Apple typically launches software at WWDC in beta, meaning that the features are first available to developers and to members of the public who want to opt in. Those features will typically remain in beta throughout the summer and launch to the public in the fall when new iPhones hit the market. Apple’s 2023 WWDC conference begins June 5. The company is expected to unveil its first virtual reality headset among other software and hardware announcements. "
OpenAI CEO embraces government regulation in Senate hearing,Kevin Collier,"May 16, 2023, 3:38 PM UTC / Updated May 16, 2023, 7:54 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"The U.S. should require companies to be licensed by the government if they want to develop powerful artificial intelligence systems, the head of one the country’s top AI companies said at a Senate committee hearing Tuesday. In his first appearance before Congress, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, said the U.S. “might consider a combination of licensing and testing requirements for development and release of AI models above a threshold of capabilities.” Altman; Christina Montgomery, chief privacy and trust officer of IBM; and Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus of psychology and neural science at New York University, were witnesses at a hearing held by the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary to discuss oversight of AI. The rapid advancement of AI systems like ChatGPT has spurred many top technologists and academics to call for the industry to pause some development — and to ask for government intervention if that doesn’t happen. But there’s little consensus on what broad regulations would look like, and Congress and federal agencies have struggled to figure out their role. On the eve of his testimony, Altman gave a presentation to about 60 lawmakers, wowing many of them and staying for nearly two hours afterward answering questions. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., said Altman also did a demo of a version of ChatGPT, which some lawmakers had never seen before. Unlike previous hearings with tech leaders like Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg or TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, where members of Congress were at times openly hostile, senators were mostly congenial with Altman and Montgomery. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., suggested that artificial intelligence models could be required to disclose what information they were trained on. “Should we consider independent testing labs to provide score cards and nutrition labels or the equivalent of nutrition labels? Packaging that indicates to people whether or not the content can be trusted, what the ingredients are?” Blumenthal said. Altman responded positively to the idea. After Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., suggested people might use AI as a source for trusted information, Altman again said he thinks the government has a role to play in regulating the technology. “I do think some regulation would be quite wise on this topic,” Altman said. “People need to know if they’re talking to an AI, if content they’re looking at might be generated or might not.” But Altman also said he believes that the public would learn to adapt to an onslaught of AI-aided false information and media. “When Photoshop came onto the scene a long time ago, for a while people were really quite fooled by photoshopped images and then pretty quickly developed an understanding that images were photoshopped,” he said. “This will be like that, but on steroids.” Marcus said that the AI industry is not far from leveraging the massive amounts of personal data that companies have on individuals to better exploit their tastes, even if OpenAI and IBM won’t do that directly. “Hyper-targeting of advertising is definitely going to come,” Marcus said. “We will definitely see it. The technology is partway there to being able to do that and we’ll certainly get there.” Some industry figures have called for the government to leave AI regulation fully to the companies behind the tech. Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, said on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday that “there’s no way a nonindustry person can understand what is possible.” Marcus called for a Cabinet-level organization within the United States to oversee AI. “The number of risks is large. The amount of information to keep up on is so much,” he said. CORRECTION (May 16, 2023, 5:51 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Ted Lieu's office. He is a representative, not a senator. "
An AI glossary: the words and terms to know about the booming industry,Jasmine Cui,"May 16, 2023, 1:10 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has brought with it a cornucopia of jargon — from ""generative AI"" to ""synthetic data"" — that can be hard to parse. And as hard as it is to really understand what AI is (see our explainer for that) having a working knowledge of AI terms can help make sense of this technology. As part of our series explaining the basics of AI, here is a short glossary of terms that will hopefully help you navigate the rapidly developing field. Artificial Intelligence: Technology that aims to replicate human-like thinking within machines.  Some examples of abilities that fall into this category include identifying people in pictures, work in factories and even doing taxes. Generative AI: Generative AI is an AI that can create things like text, images, sound and video. Traditional applications of AI largely classify content, while generative AI models create it. For instance, a voice recognition model can identify your voice, while a generative voice model can use your voice to create audiobooks. Almost all models that have recently captured the public’s attention have been generative, including chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, image creators like Stable Diffusion and MidJourney, and voice-cloning programs like Resemble. Training Data: A collection of information — text, image, sound — curated to help AI models accomplish tasks. In language models, training datasets focus on text-based materials like books, comments from social media, and even code. Because AI models learn from training data, ethical questions have been raised around its sourcing and curation. Low-quality training data can introduce bias, leading to unfair models that make racist or sexist decisions. Algorithmic Bias: An error resulting from bad training data and poor programming that causes models to make prejudiced decisions. Such models may draw inappropriate assumptions based on gender, ability or race. In practice, these errors can cause serious harm by affecting decision-making — from mortgage applications to organ-transplant approvals. Many critics of the speedy rollout of AI have invoked the potential for algorithmic bias. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): A description of programs that are as capable — or even more capable — than a human. While full general intelligence is still off in the future, models are growing in sophistication. Some have demonstrated skills across multiple domains ranging from chemistry to psychology, with task performance paralleling human benchmarks. Autonomous Agents: An AI model that has both an objective and enough tools to achieve it. For instance, self-driving cars are autonomous agents that use sensory input, GPS data and driving algorithms to make independent decisions about how to navigate and reach destinations. A group of autonomous agents can even develop cultures, traditions and shared language, as researchers from Stanford have demonstrated. Prompt Chaining: The process of using previous interactions with an AI model to create new, more finely tuned responses, specifically in prompt-driven language modeling. For example, when you ask ChatGPT to send your friend a text, you expect it to remember things like the tone you use to talk to her, inside jokes and other content from previous conversations. These techniques help incorporate this context. Large Language Models (LLM): An application of AI — usually generative — that aims to understand, engage and communicate with language in a human-like way. These models are distinguished by their large size: The biggest version of GPT-3, a direct predecessor to ChatGPT, contained 175 billion different variables called parameters that were trained on 570 gigabytes of data. Google’s PaLm model is even larger, having 540 billion parameters. As hardware and software continue to advance, this scale is expected to increase. Hallucination: Hallucinations are unexpected and incorrect responses from AI programs that can arise for reasons that are not yet fully known. A language model might suddenly bring up fruit salad recipes when you were asking about planting fruit trees. It might also make up scholarly citations, lie about data you ask it to analyze, or make up facts about events that aren’t in its training data. It’s not fully understood why this happens, but can arise from sparse data, information gaps and misclassification. Emergent Behavior: Skills that AI might demonstrate that it was not explicitly built for. Some examples include emoji interpretation, sarcasm and using gender-inclusive language. A research team at Google Brain identified over 100 of these behaviors, noting that more are likely to emerge as models continue to scale. Alignment: Efforts to ensure AI systems share the same values and goals as their human operators. To bring motives into agreement, alignment research seeks to train and calibrate models, often using functions to reward or penalize models. If the model does a good job, you give it positive feedback. If not, you give it negative feedback. Multimodal AI: A form of AI that can understand and work with multiple types of information, including text, image, speech and more. This is powerful because it allows AI to understand and express itself in multiple dimensions, giving both a broader and more nuanced understanding of tasks. One application of multimodal AI is this translator, which can convert Japanese comics into English. Prompt Engineering: This is the act of giving AI an instruction so it has the context it needs to achieve your goal. Prompt engineering is best associated with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, describing the tasks users feed into the algorithm (e.g. “Give me five popular baby names”). Training: Training is the process of refining AI using data so it’s better suited for a task. An AI can be trained by feeding in data based on what you want it to learn from — like feeding Shakespearean sonnets to a poetry bot. You can do this multiple times in iterations called “epochs,” until your model’s performance is consistent and reliable. Neural Networks: Neural networks are computer systems constructed to approximate the structure of human thought, specifically via the structure of your brain. They’re built like this because they allow a model to build up from the abstract to the concrete. In an image model, initial layers, concepts like color or position might be formed, building up to firmer, more familiar forms like fruit or animals. Narrow AI: Some AI algorithms have a one-track mind. Literally. They’re designed to do one thing and nothing more. If a narrow AI algorithm can play checkers, it can’t play chess. Examples include algorithms that only detect NSFW images and recommendation engines designed to tell you what Amazon or Etsy product to buy next. "
Trying to make sense of artificial intelligence? Here’s your guide,David Ingram,"May 16, 2023, 1:09 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Artificial intelligence has, for decades, been fodder for science fiction films, philosophers and sleep-deprived computer programmers, but suddenly it seems to be everywhere. ChatGPT reached 100 million users at an unprecedented rate. Bill Gates recently declared that “the Age of AI has begun.” And the Biden administration last month began exploring new measures to hold artificial intelligence systems accountable for their impact. But for a lot of people, it’s still a fuzzy concept that doesn’t affect their day-to-day lives. So this might be a good moment to take a step back and review the basics. Here’s a guide to help you understand what all the hype is about. You can thank (or blame) one specific company: OpenAI, a tech startup based in San Francisco with a few hundred employees. In November, OpenAI released the chatbot ChatGPT to the public, and it quickly became clear that it was leaps and bounds ahead of chatbots that had come before. It was like talking to someone who knew everything. The tool, which the company says is only one step in a long process of developing AI, quickly went viral. Other tech companies, such as Google and Meta, had been testing similar chatbots behind closed doors, but OpenAI made its widely available — a decision that was controversial because of the unknown risks. Mediocre chatbots have been around for a long time. Think of the customer service chat windows that pop up on some websites. In 2016, Microsoft even released an AI chatbot named Tay but quickly canceled it after people taught it to use racist language. ChatGPT came on the scene as something different. Not only could it answer a seemingly unlimited number of questions, but it could also write screenplays, summarize huge amounts of information and imitate a human in conversation somewhat convincingly. It immediately seemed, at a minimum, that it could one day make everyday life more efficient. And chatbots are only one piece of AI, along with images, animated videos, facial recognition technology and more. At its simplest, AI can be boiled down to a few words: machines that think. Or, even better, machines that can imitate thinking. The term has its origins among scientists after World War II. British mathematician Alan Turing in 1950 all but predicted the development of “digital computers” that could persuasively imitate humans, and in 1955, American mathematician John McCarthy and colleagues at Dartmouth College coined the term “artificial intelligence” in a research proposal. “Generative AI,” a newer term, refers to software like ChatGPT that gives rise to new material. You can find a more extensive glossary of AI terms here. We could write a whole book on this one, but here’s a short answer: No, they can’t. While a few people believe AI is already coming alive, they’re a small group, and the idea is really a distraction from what’s going on inside the computers. If you’d like a longer answer, NBC News spoke with several philosophers about how they approach the question. AI software is able to imitate humans so convincingly because it’s good at prediction: It guesses the word or sentence or image you want to see next. (Some detractors have called this “glorified autocomplete.”) And the systems are so good at prediction because their human creators have fed them so many human-created past examples — including huge parts of the internet. The raw material that goes into AI models is called training data, and although some companies are secretive about what they use, well-known sources of data include Reddit and Wikipedia. AI learns by example. By looking to us, language models identify patterns in how we write and speak, distilling concepts like tone, word placement and even idioms. Those patterns are then translated into math in a process called “model training.” Like children learning new words and grammar, AI must understand the rules of engagement. When large language models like ChatGPT receive prompts, that knowledge allows them to both understand what we’re asking for and construct responses. ChatGPT takes training further with its secret sauce: reinforcement learning from human feedback, or RLHF. This fine-tuning technique does the heavy lifting. In this stage, human graders score model output, heavily penalizing answers that are wild, inappropriate or downright nonsensical while rewarding those that are informative and humanlike. That enables fluid conversational exchanges. While there are other fine-tuning techniques, RLHF has been considered groundbreaking in language modeling, and it is used by companies such as OpenAI or Hugging Face, a startup that offers tools to coders building their own AI models. The tech industry has been churning through one fad after another lately, from self-driving cars and the metaverse to NFTs and web3. On one level, AI chatbots may bear some resemblance to those disappointing ideas — do we all really want to spend our days talking to a computer? — but there are reasons to think AI is more than another passing trend. For one thing, money is pouring into the sector, with $1.7 billion in startup investments alone in the first three months of 2023, according to the research firm PitchBook. In addition, tangible uses are already popping up, from hit songs to help for the blind. It has been 26 years since the triumph of IBM’s Deep Blue computer program over chess champion Garry Kasparov — a milestone in AI research and development. Since then, computer chips have gotten much faster and can handle the huge amount of data required for modern AI, and new ways of writing software have also made the process more efficient. Chipmakers such as Nvidia and tech companies including Google, Meta and OpenAI have poured resources into those two areas, as well as into consolidating talented computer scientists under their respective roofs. Don’t expect to wake up one morning and suddenly live in an AI world. Instead, expect that changes will come a little at a time: a hit song created with AI, a new test at the doctor’s office to detect cancer or slightly better customer service. OpenAI has licensed its technology to Morgan Stanley so its investment advisers can give better advice and to Khan Academy so its students have access to a chatbot tutor. Think of all the businesses or products you deal with every day, and there’s a good chance one is using similar technology or will in the near future — even if the only immediate impact is a little bit more efficiency. It’s hard to know what to count on, but yes, there’s plenty of dreaming going on in AI startups. If AI software can make both human work and computers more efficient, could all that brainpower be put toward major advances in other new areas? Two areas where there seems to be a lot of optimism: drugstore shelves filled with new AI-designed pharmaceuticals and AI software that could enable new power plants based on cleaner fusion energy. The predictions run the gamut, so if you’re confused, you’re not alone. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that AI will lead to a utopia in which people don’t need to work, while others warn of mass unemployment among computer programmers. Even economists who specialize in labor are stumped, advising that AI will change people’s jobs and supplement existing work but otherwise avoiding specific predictions. One set of researchers recently tried to rank jobs by risk that AI will alter what people do. In trouble, according to them: telemarketers, humanities professors and credit authorizers. Harder to replace: dancers, stonemasons and steelworkers. Again, the predictions are all over the place, from a more equitable society to a less equal one. A lot depends on how politicians and voters react, and the Biden administration and Congress are paying increasing attention to AI research and development. But some of the early leaders are the big tech companies, such as Google, Meta and Amazon; OpenAI, which converted in 2019 from a nonprofit to a for-profit company; and whoever survives among the dozens of AI startups that collectively are raising billions of dollars from early investors. If you go by science fiction films or the nightmares of a few researchers, there’s a chance of killer robots: AI becoming sentient beings with motivations of their own. Prompted by that scenario, thousands of people, including Elon Musk and some AI researchers, signed a petition calling for a pause of at least six months in training new AI systems. Some top tech executives and researchers, however, didn’t sign it. And at least so far, there isn’t overwhelming information suggesting that humans are in immediate danger because of AI. It depends on whom you ask. Most of the immediate risks have to do with short-term abuse by humans, not robots. There’s ongoing research into using AI to crack people’s passwords, and The Washington Post uncovered someone using an AI-generated photo as a thirst trap, possibly for cash. One thing to watch: how quickly we see progress in physical robots. The hardware hasn’t advanced as far as the software, and two years ago, OpenAI disbanded its robotics team even after it had gotten a robot to solve a Rubik’s Cube. But now OpenAI is investing in a Norwegian robotics company. "
Gimmick or innovation? Self-driving bus starts taking passengers in U.K. trial,Matt Bradley,"May 16, 2023, 9:59 AM UTC",World,"EDINBURGH, Scotland — Organizers are calling it a first for autonomous transportation: computer-driven buses operating on a real route with real passengers navigating through real traffic. But don’t call Edinburgh’s new autonomous buses, which began their service Tuesday, “driverless.” They’re staffed by not just one but two transport employees — twice the number required for a conventional bus in Scotland’s bustling capital. It’s why this bold step toward the future of public transportation remains very much an experiment — a yearslong trial aimed as much at assuaging the public as testing new technology. “When the technology is completely signed off and we’re allowed to take the driver out of the cab, he’ll be able to move around the saloon, engage with passengers, check tickets, keep the service successful, that kind of thing,” said Steven Russell, 34, an innovation manager for Stagecoach Scotland, one of Britain’s largest bus operators. The company outfitted the fleet of five Alexander Dennis Enviro200AV vehicles with autonomous driver technology. But until then, passengers could be forgiven for regarding Scotland’s autonomous buses as little more than an impractical gimmick. "
Al Roker shares update after knee replacement surgery,"Scott Stump, TODAY","May 15, 2023, 1:20 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Al Roker on Monday made a video call to TODAY on May 15 to update his progress since undergoing a total knee replacement on May 9 that now has him resting at home. “It’s stiff,” Roker said. “This one is a little more complicated because it was what they call a revision. It’s was a replacement of a replacement, so they had to take stuff out, put new stuff in, so it was a bit of a bear.” Roker was already walking down the hallway at New York City’s Hospital for Special Surgery a day after the procedure, but he has been taking it easy since returning home. “Just been kind of hanging out,” he said. “Just chilling out, not doing anything, which I know a lot of people find hard to believe, but in fact that is the case.” As he catches up on “Poker Face” and “The Mandalorian,” he said he will be doing three days of physical rehabilitation per week for “a few months” to get himself back up to speed. He also shared his outlook for his return to TODAY. “I’m hoping maybe sometime in the next two weeks to be back,” he said. “I’ll just play it by ear every day, and that’s the thing. And yes, I know, I’m not going to rush back before I have to.” He enjoyed a low-key Mother’s Day for his wife, Deborah Roberts, after they decided to order some quiche because going out to one of their favorite restaurant was “not realistic” given Roker's condition. Roker also is enjoying the return of his son, Nick, from college after Deborah helped him pack up his dorm room on Mother’s Day. “Nick just got back home from school, so that’s been great,” Roker said. “Until I heard him click into that Peloton in the room next door. I was hoping that recall might’ve slowed him down a little bit.” This is Roker's second knee replacement surgery in two years, as he also underwent one in April 2022. By August 2022, he hit a 200-day streak of walking 10,000 steps and even walked the Brooklyn Half Marathon. This past March, Roker celebrated his “best day yet,” hitting a record of more than 13,600 steps in a day. "
Snapchat influencer launches an AI-powered 'virtual girlfriend' to help 'cure loneliness',Daysia Tolentino,"May 12, 2023, 10:51 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Caryn Marjorie wanted to talk to as many of her followers as she could — so she made an AI clone of herself. The Snapchat influencer, who has 1.8 million subscribers, launched an AI-powered, voice-based chatbot that she hopes will ""cure loneliness."" Called CarynAI, the chatbot is described on its website as a ""virtual girlfriend."" It allows Marjorie's fans to ""enjoy private, personalized conversations"" with an AI version of the influencer, the chatbot's website states. The bot has gone viral, with Marjorie making headlines, stirring backlash and even receiving some death threats. The bot has also ignited discourse around the ethics of companion chatbots. Marjorie, who in her Twitter bio calls herself 'The first influencer transformed into AI,"" did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a tweet on Thursday, she wrote “CarynAI is the first step in the right direction to cure loneliness."" ""Men are told to suppress their emotions, hide their masculinity, and to not talk about issues they are having,"" Marjorie, 23, wrote. ""I vow to fix this with CarynAI. I have worked with the world’s leading psychologists to seamlessly add [cognitive behavioral therapy] and [dialectic behavior therapy] within chats. This will help undo trauma, rebuild physical and emotional confidence, and rebuild what has been taken away by the pandemic.” The CarynAI website states that the team spent over 2,000 hours designing and coding the chatbot to create an ""immersive AI experience."" Forever Voices, an AI company, developed the chatbot by analyzing Marjorie's now-deleted YouTube content and layering it with OpenAI's GPT4 software. John Meyer, CEO of Forever Voices, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He tweeted Thursday that he is ""Proud of our team for the thousands of hours of work put into this,"" calling the partnership with Marjorie ""an incredible step forward in the future of AI-to-Human interaction!"" According to a Fortune report, CarynAI generated $71,610 in revenue after one week of beta testing the ""virtual girlfriend."" Fans reportedly pay $1 per minute to use the chatbot and there are currently over 1,000 users. While CarynAI aims to give users an intimate experience, it is not supposed to engage in ""sexually explicit"" interactions. However, after outlets reported that the chatbot does so when prompted, Marjorie issued a statement to Insider saying that the AI was  ""not programmed to do this and has seemed to go rogue. My team and I are working around the clock to prevent this from happening again."" Irina Raicu, director of internet ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, said the launch of CarynAI seems premature ""because problems that should have been absolutely anticipated don’t seem to have been.” Prior tools have underwent similar problems as CarynAI, Raicu said. She pointed to a recent incident with the AI company Replika, which was similarly founded to provide supportive AI companions, scrambling to combat erotic roleplay among its chatbots. Raicu also expressed concern that CarynAI's claims to potentially ""cure loneliness"" are not backed up by sufficient psychological or sociological research. ""These kind of grand claims about a product's goodness can just mask the desire to monetize further the fact that people want to pretend to have a relationship with an influencer,"" she said. These kind of grand claims about a product’s goodness can just mask the desire to monetize further the fact that people want to pretend to have a relationship with an influencer -Irina Raicu, director of internet ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University These types of chatbots can add ""a second layer of unreality"" to parasocial relationships between influencers and fans, she noted. Raicu said she finds the claim around CarynAI, particularly Marjorie’s assertion that it is “an extension of my consciousness,” problematic. “These are claims that AI researchers have been trying so hard to combat, to tell people this is absolutely not what such tools do even if the language now is sounding like there’s sentience behind it,” she said. “There isn’t.” Raicu said influencers should be aware of the Federal Trade Commission’s guidance on artificial intelligence products. In February, the FTC released guidelines for advertisers promoting AI products and urged companies to avoid exaggerating claims. Meyer told Fortune that his company is looking to hire a chief ethics officer and that it takes ethics ""seriously."" Marjorie continues to tweet updates about the bot. On Friday, she wrote: ""if you are rude to CarynAI, it will dump you."" "
Former NBCUniversal ad chief Linda Yaccarino named CEO of Twitter,Jason Abbruzzese,"May 12, 2023, 1:27 PM UTC / Updated May 12, 2023, 5:33 PM UTC",Tech News,"Elon Musk said Friday that Linda Yaccarino, the former head of ad sales for NBCUniversal, will be Twitter's next CEO. He tweeted the news just hours after NBCUniversal said Yaccarino was leaving the company. Musk said she ""will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology."" Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. The company announced Yaccarino's departure in a news release, noting it was effective immediately. “It has been an absolute honor to be part of Comcast NBCUniversal and lead the most incredible team,” Yaccarino said in the news release. “We’ve transformed our company and the entire industry—and I am so proud of what we’ve accomplished together, and grateful to my colleagues and mentors, especially Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and the entire NBCU leadership team.” Musk said Thursday that he had hired a new CEO, though he did not name that person and offered few details aside from that ""she"" would start in about six weeks. He said he plans to remain with the company as its chief technology officer. Yaccarino, 60, joined NBCUniversal in 2011 and oversaw one of the largest advertising portfolios in U.S. media, including cable and broadcast television, multiple news outlets and, more recently, the company's digital platforms, including Peacock. She recently interviewed Musk at a marketing event in Miami. Yaccarino joins as Twitter remains in flux. The company is far smaller now than when Musk took over in October, having laid off thousands of employees. It has reportedly struggled to retain advertisers since then, a situation she will need to address. She may not yet be a household name, but she is among the most recognizable people in the advertising industry. Those relationships could be key to getting advertisers to come back to Twitter. ""While overseeing billions in annual ad revenue and keeping tight relationships with marketers and ad agencies globally, we believe that this would be a homerun hire for Twitter and fit in very well to the overall Twitter strategy and monetization looking ahead,"" Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst covering the technology sector at the wealth management company Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note released Friday morning. Some of Musk's supporters were less enthused, noting that Yaccarino is coming from a mainstream media organization and worked with the World Economic Forum, a nongovernmental organization that puts on a yearly meeting in Davos, Switzerland, of the world's richest and most influential people. Musk tweeted in January that the group ""is increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don’t want."" Actor and pro-Trump influencer James Woods tweeted a picture of Yaccarino’s LinkedIn page, highlighting her work at the WEF. “Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. I wonder how they got to him?” he wrote, referring to Musk. Yaccarino is the second high-profile NBCUniversal exec to leave the company in recent weeks as the company continues to be the subject of speculation about its future with Comcast. Jeff Shell stepped down as CEO of NBCUniversal after an investigation found that he had engaged in ""inappropriate conduct."" Former CNBC anchor Hadley Gamble has accused Shell of sexual harassment and sex discrimination. Shell has not responded to those accusations, but said in a statement following his resignation that he had “an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company.” "
"Cat and dog torture videos litter Twitter, adding to concerns about moderation",Ben Collins,"May 12, 2023, 5:06 PM UTC",Tech News,"Graphic videos of animal abuse have circulated widely on Twitter in recent weeks, generating outrage and renewed concern over the platform’s moderation practices. One such video, in which a kitten appears to be placed inside a blender and then killed, has become so notorious that reactions to it have become their own genre of internet content. Laura Clemens, 46, said her 11-year-old son came home from his school in London two weeks ago and asked if she had seen the video. “There’s something about a cat in a blender,” Clemens remembered her son saying. Clemens said she went on Twitter and searched for “cat,” and the search box suggested searching for “cat in a blender.” Clemens said that she clicked on the suggested search term and a gruesome video of what appeared to be a kitten being killed inside of a blender appeared instantly. For users who have not manually turned off autoplay, the video will begin rolling instantly. NBC News was able to replicate the same process to surface the video on Wednesday. Clemens said she is grateful her child asked her about the video instead of simply going on Twitter and typing in the word “cat” by himself. “I’m glad that my child has talked to me, but there must be lots of parents whose kids just look it up,” she said. The spread of the video as well as its presence in Twitter’s suggested searches is part of a worrying trend of animal cruelty videos that have littered the social media platform following Elon Musk’s takeover, which included mass layoffs and deep cuts to the company’s content moderation and safety teams. Last weekend, gory videos from two violent events in Texas spread on Twitter, with some users saying that the images had been pushed into the platform’s algorithmic “For You” feed. The animal abuse videos appear to predate those videos. Various users have tweeted that they have seen the cat video, with some trying to get Musk’s attention on the issue — some dating back to early May. Clemens said she flagged the video on May 3 to Twitter’s support account and Ella Irwin, the vice president of trust and safety at Twitter and one of Musk’s closest advisers. “Young children know this has been trending on your site. My little one hasn’t seen it but knows about it. It should not be an autofill suggestion,” Clemens wrote. Neither Irwin nor Twitter safety responded to the tweet, Clemens said. Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, told NBC News that he believes the company likely dismantled a series of safeguards meant to stop these kinds of autocomplete problems. Roth explained that autocompleted search results on Twitter were internally known as “type-ahead search” and that the company had built a system to prevent illegal, illicit and dangerous content from appearing as autocompleting suggestions. “There is an extensive, well-built and maintained list of things that filtered type-ahead search, and a lot of it was constructed with wildcards and regular expressions,” Roth said. Roth said there was a several-step process to prevent gore and death videos from appearing in autocompleted search suggestions. The process was a combination of automatic and human moderation, which flagged animal cruelty and violent videos before they began to appear automatically in search results. “Type-ahead search was really not easy to break. These are longstanding systems with multiple layers of redundancy,” said Roth. “If it just stops working, it almost defies probability.” Autocomplete suggestions in search bars are a common feature on many social media platforms, and they can often surface disturbing content. The terms for “dog” and “cat” autocompleted viral animal cruelty videos in Twitter’s search box Thursday, when NBC News contacted the company for comment. Twitter’s press account automatically responded with a poop emoji, the company’s standard response for the last month. As of Friday afternoon, Twitter appeared to have turned off its autocomplete suggestions in its search bar. "
Elon Musk says he's hired a new CEO for Twitter and will reduce his own role,David Ingram,"May 11, 2023, 8:51 PM UTC",Tech News,"Twitter owner Elon Musk said Thursday he has hired a new CEO to run the social media platform. Musk made the announcement in a tweet but did not immediately name the new executive. He also said he would reduce his own day-to-day involvement with the site, serving as executive chair and as Twitter's chief technology officer with oversight of product changes. Musk appeared to offer one small hint about the next CEO, saying that ""she"" would be starting in about 6 weeks. Investors in some of Musk's other companies including Tesla have expressed concern for months that the tech billionaire was too distracted by Twitter and was short-changing his other responsibilities. Tesla's share price spiked about 2% immediately after the tweet. Musk bought Twitter in October for $44 billion after a monthslong fight with its prior management over the price and health of the company. He has made sweeping changes in the six-plus months since then, laying off the vast majority of Twitter's employees, reinstating the accounts of suspended users, including former President Donald Trump, and loosening the rules of when Twitter allows potentially objectionable material. Under Musk, Twitter also eliminated its program of verifying accounts of notable public figures, instead reserving blue-and-white checkmarks for people who've subscribed to its premium service. It's not clear whether the new CEO will continue to seek major changes, but she will be precedent-shattering in at least one respect: Twitter has never had a female CEO since its founding in 2006. Musk will now likely have more time for his other companies. He is the CEO of the automaker Tesla and of SpaceX, the engineering and rocket company that last month launched the largest rocket ever built as part of a plan to eventually send people to Mars. Even other tech investors have questioned the wisdom of Musk spending so much time on a social media product given his other duties. ""Can you think of a prominent person who's currently wasting his talents in software when he could be working on manufacturing and heavy industries?"" investor Paul Graham dryly asked Musk on Twitter last month. Musk is the world's second-wealthiest person, with a net worth of $168 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. "
How Europe is leading the world in building guardrails around AI,Associated Press,"May 11, 2023, 1:33 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Authorities around the world are racing to draw up rules for artificial intelligence, including in the European Union, where draft legislation faced a pivotal moment on Thursday. A European Parliament committee voted to strengthen the flagship legislative proposal as it heads toward passage, part of a yearslong effort by Brussels to draw up guardrails for artificial intelligence. Those efforts have taken on more urgency as the rapid advances of chatbots like ChatGPT highlight benefits the emerging technology can bring — and the new perils it poses. Here’s a look at the E.U.’s Artificial Intelligence Act: The AI Act, first proposed in 2021, will govern any product or service that uses an artificial intelligence system. The act will classify AI systems according to four levels of risk, from minimal to unacceptable. Riskier applications will face tougher requirements, including being more transparent and using accurate data. Think about it as a “risk management system for AI,” said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute. One of the E.U.’s main goals is to guard against any AI threats to health and safety and protect fundamental rights and values. That means some AI uses are an absolute no-no, such as “social scoring” systems that judge people based on their behavior. AI that exploits vulnerable people including children or that uses subliminal manipulation that can result in harm, such as an interactive talking toy that encourages dangerous behavior, is also forbidden. Lawmakers beefed up the proposal by voting to ban predictive policing tools, which crunch data to forecast where crimes will happen and who will commit them. They also approved a widened ban on remote facial recognition, save for a few law enforcement exceptions like preventing a specific terrorist threat. The technology scans passers-by and uses AI to match their faces to a database. The aim is “to avoid a controlled society based on AI,” Brando Benifei, the Italian lawmaker helping lead the European Parliament’s AI efforts, told reporters Wednesday. “We think that these technologies could be used instead of the good also for the bad, and we consider the risks to be too high.” AI systems used in high risk categories like employment and education, which would affect the course of a person’s life, face tough requirements such as being transparent with users and putting in place risk assessment and mitigation measures. The E.U.’s executive arm says most AI systems, such as video games or spam filters, fall into the low- or no-risk category. The original 108-page proposal barely mentioned chatbots, merely requiring them to be labeled so users know they’re interacting with a machine. Negotiators later added provisions to cover general purpose AI like ChatGPT, subjecting them to some of the same requirements as high-risk systems. One key addition is a requirement to thoroughly document any copyright material used to teach AI systems how to generate text, images, video or music that resembles human work. That would let content creators know if their blog posts, digital books, scientific articles or pop songs have been used to train algorithms that power systems like ChatGPT. Then they could decide whether their work has been copied and seek redress. The European Union isn’t a big player in cutting-edge AI development. That role is taken by the U.S. and China. But Brussels often plays a trendsetting role with regulations that tend to become de facto global standards. “Europeans are, globally speaking, fairly wealthy and there’s a lot of them,” so companies and organizations often decide that the sheer size of the bloc’s single market with 450 million consumers makes it easier to comply than develop different products for different regions, Laux said. But it’s not just a matter of cracking down. By laying down common rules for AI, Brussels is also trying to develop the market by instilling confidence among users, Laux said. “The thinking behind it is if you can induce people to to place trust in AI and in applications, they will also use it more,” Laux said. “And when they use it more, they will unlock the economic and social potential of AI.” Violations will draw fines of up to 30 million euros ($33 million) or 6% of a company’s annual global revenue, which in the case of tech companies like Google and Microsoft could amount to billions. It could be years before the rules fully take effect. European Union lawmakers are now due to vote on the draft legislation at a plenary session in mid-June. Then it moves into three-way negotiations involving the bloc’s 27 member states, the Parliament and the executive Commission, where it could face more changes as they wrangle over the details. Final approval is expected by the end of the year, or early 2024 at the latest, followed by a grace period for companies and organizations to adapt, often around two years. "
NBC News' Morgan Chesky opens up about 'frightening' health scare during hike,A. Pawlowski,"May 11, 2023, 12:59 PM UTC",Health news,"After having hiked all of his life, NBC News correspondent Morgan Chesky had never heard of high-altitude pulmonary edema — until an incident he described as “absolutely frightening” could have led to a cardiac arrest. “I could have never imagined a trip to Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks would end on oxygen in an ICU,” Chesky said Thursday as he opened up about the ordeal on NBC News' ""TODAY"" show. It was the journalist’s first time in an ambulance and the intensive care unit. He had no idea what was wrong, he wrote on Instagram in April when he first shared details of the emergency. The hiking trip was to celebrate his 37th birthday. On the show, Chesky recalled “feeling off” while walking with his uncle Eric, who in turn noticed his nephew was moving a little slower than he normally did as they began hiking in Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah. “That’s why I continued to watch you like a hawk for the rest of the trip,” Eric Chesky said. Hiking in Zion National Park, Utah, the next day, Morgan Chesky felt even worse — lightheaded and weak, with a skyrocketing pulse — and had to stop frequently to catch his breath. The symptoms were especially frightening because his father had similar warning signs before he died of a heart attack at 48. Sensing he was in trouble, his uncle grabbed his backpack, helped him off the trail and drove him to an urgent care clinic one hour away. Tests showed his blood oxygen saturation levels were at 58% — half of what they should be. An ambulance took the journalist to Cedar City Hospital in Utah on April 23, where Dr. Jarid Gray found his lungs were filling with fluid and diagnosed him with high-altitude pulmonary edema — a severe form of high-altitude illness, according to the National Library of Medicine. “The simplest way to think about it is all your capillaries in your lungs started leaking the plasma out into the little space (they’re) occupying, so it’s harder for oxygen to go across,” Gray said. If untreated, a person can pass out from lack of oxygen or go into cardiac arrest, the doctor noted. Half of patients who don’t get help in time die, the National Library of Medicine noted. That’s what happened to John Magness, 58, an accomplished hiker who climbed Argentina’s Mount Aconcagua in February. Hours later, he passed away from HAPE-induced cardiac arrest, his family said. “He was a very physically fit person and never yet never had any of these kinds of struggles on his other climbs,” his daughter Chelsea Shelburne noted. “I think, truly, it can happen to anyone. Plan ahead and be prepared as best as you can for emergency scenarios.” Doctors don’t know why the illness strikes some people, but not others. HAPE can occur at altitudes as low as 6,500 feet, with risk factors that include a rapid rate of ascent, using sleep medication, eating too much salt, being in cold weather and engaging in heavy physical exertion, according to the National Library of Medicine. Men seem to be more at risk than women, it added. Symptoms include fatigue, labored breathing, chest pain and dry cough with exertion. The main treatment is for the patient to head to a lower altitude with as little exertion as possible until symptoms improve, the National Library of Medicine noted. Supplemental oxygen and certain medicines can also help. After receiving medical care and returning to a lower elevation, Morgan Chesky has recovered and is grateful to his uncle for making it home. “Much love for having my back out there,” he told him. "
Google is giving its dominant search engine an artificial intelligence makeover,Associated Press,"May 10, 2023, 10:47 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Google on Wednesday disclosed plans to infuse its dominant search engine with more advanced artificial intelligence technology, a drive that’s in response to one of the biggest threats to its long-established position as the internet’s main gateway. The gradual shift in how Google’s search engine runs is rolling out three months after Microsoft’s Bing search engine started to tap into technology similar to that which powers the artificially intelligent chatbot ChatGPT, which has created one of Silicon Valley’s biggest buzzes since Apple released the first iPhone 16 years ago. Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., already has been testing its own conversational chatbot called Bard. That product, powered by technology called generative AI that also fuels ChatGPT, has only been available to people accepted from a waitlist. But Google announced Wednesday that Bard will be available to all comers in more than 180 countries and more languages beyond English. Bard’s multilingual expansion will begin with Japanese and Korean before adding about 40 more languages. Now Google is ready to test the AI waters with its search engine, which has been synonymous with finding things on the internet for the past 20 years and serves as the pillar of a digital advertising empire that generated more than $220 billion in revenue last year. “We are at an exciting inflection point,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told a packed developers conference in a speech peppered with one AI reference after another. “We are reimagining all our products, including search.” More AI technology will be coming to Google’s Gmail with a “Help Me Write” option that will produce lengthy replies to emails in seconds, and a tool for photos called “Magic Editor” that will automatically doctor pictures. The AI transition will begin cautiously with the search engine that serves as Google’s crown jewel. The deliberate approach reflects the balancing act that Google must negotiate as it tries to remain on the cutting edge while also preserving its reputation for delivering reliable search results — a mantle that could be undercut by artificial intelligence’s penchant for fabricating information that sounds authoritative. The tendency to produce deceptively convincing answers to questions — a phenomenon euphemistically described as “hallucinations” — has already been cropping up during the early testing of Bard, which like ChatGPT, relies on still-evolving generative AI technology. Google will take its next AI steps through a newly formed search lab where people in the U.S. can join a waitlist to test how generative AI will be incorporated in search results. The tests also include the more traditional links to external websites where users can read more extensive information about queried topics. It may take several weeks before Google starts sending invitations to those accepted from the waitlist to test the AI-injected search engine. The AI results will be clearly tagged as an experimental form of technology and Google is pledging the AI-generated summaries will sound more factual than conversational — a distinct contrast from Bard and ChatGPT, which are programmed to convey more human-like personas. Google is building in guardrails that will prevent the AI baked into the search engine from responding to sensitive questions about health — such as, “Should I give Tylenol to a 3-year-old?” — and finance matters. In those instances, Google will continue to steer people to authoritative websites. Google isn’t predicting how long it will be before its search engine will include generative AI results for all comers. The Mountain View, California, company has been under intensifying pressure to demonstrate how its search engine will maintain its leadership since Microsoft began to load AI into Bing, which remains a distant second to Google. The potential threat caused Alphabet’s stock price to initially plunge, although it has recently bounced back to where it stood when Bing announced its AI plans to great fanfare. More recently, The New York Times reported Samsung is considering dropping Google as the default search engine on its widely used smartphones, raising the specter that Apple might adopt a similar tactic with the iPhone unless Google can show its search engine can evolve with what appears to be a forthcoming AI-driven revolution. Alphabet’s shares surged 4% Wednesday after Google’s wave of AI announcements to finish at $111.75, the highest closing price since Bing began melding with ChatGPT in early February. As it begins to ingrain AI in its search engine, Google is aiming to make Bard smarter by connecting with the next generation of a massive data set known as a “large language model,” or LLM, that fuels it. The LLM that Bard relies on is dubbed Pathways Language Model, or PaLM. The AI in Google’s search engine will draw upon the next-generation PaLM2 and another technology known as a Multitask Unified Model, or MUM. Although people will have to wait to see how Google’s search engine will deploy generative AI to find answers, a new tool soon be more broadly available to all users. Google is going to add a new filter called “Perspectives” that will focus on what people are saying online about whatever topic is entered into the search engine. The new feature will be placed along existing search filters for news, images and video. Besides using its annual tech showcase to tout its prowess in AI, Google also unveiled the first foldable smartphone in its Pixel line-up of gadgets. Google’s entry into a new type of smartphone design that allows users to deploy the device as a mini-tablet too comes nearly three years after Samsung — the leading maker of smartphones powered by Google’s Android software — introduced its first bendable model. Foldable phones so far have remained a niche market, largely because of prices ranging between $1,500 and $2,000. Last year, about 14 million foldable phones were sold worldwide, accounting for just 1% of overall smartphone shipments, according to the research firm International Data Corp. Google’s foldable Pixel phone will sell for $1,800 and begin shipping next month. It will unfold with a hinge and, of course, be packed with AI. "
"Heather Armstrong, founder of mommy blog Dooce, dies at 47",Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 10, 2023, 7:59 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Heather Armstrong, founder of one of the first mommy blogs, Dooce.com, has died, according to an Instagram post on her account. She was 47. ""Heather Brooke Hamilton aka Heather B. Armstrong aka dooce aka love of my life. July 19, 1975 — May 9, 2023. 'It takes an ocean not to break.' Hold your loved ones close and love everyone else,"" the post on Instagram reads. She is survived by daughters Leta, 19, and Marlo, 14; her ex-husband, Jon Armstrong, and her boyfriend, Pete Ashdown. A request for comment sent to Jon Armstrong was not immediately returned. In response to an Instagram comment expressing disbelief that the news was true, he wrote, “Afraid so.” Armstrong died by suicide, Ashdown told The Associated Press. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Once deemed ""Queen of the Mommy Bloggers,"" Armstrong rose to prominence in the early days of the internet, becoming one of the first ""momfluencers"" and blazing a trail for a wealth of other women to follow with the advent of Twitter, TikTok, Instagram and other social media. Her blog launched in 2001 and she quickly grew in popularity for her candor. She shared her experiences with leaving the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with sex and discussed the highs and lows of raising her daughters. In 2009, Forbes named Armstrong one of the most influential women in media, noting her blog averaged 300,000 followers at the time. In an April 15, 2012 interview with Savannah Guthrie on ""TODAY,"" Armstrong said she was “really scared” to share the news of her divorce from her husband. “A lot of people bring their own perspective and experience to something like this and I didn’t know if talking about it was going to destroy everything,” Armstrong said at the time. “I thought I had to talk about it, because I felt inauthentic not to share what was going on, because I’ve been so open about my life for almost 11 years.” Armstrong was also open about her mental health, particularly her struggles with depression. She published several books, including a book of essays entitled “Things I Learned About My Dad (in Therapy): Essays”; a memoir entitled “It Sucked and Then I Cried: How I Had a Baby, a Breakdown, and a Much Needed Margarita”; and a book about her struggle with suicidal depression titled “The Valedictorian of Being Dead: The True Story of Dying Ten Times to Live.” After news of Armstrong's death broke on social media, many reflected on what her blog had meant to them. ""It’s shocking to hear Heather Armstrong died yesterday,"" author Roxane Gay wrote in a tweet. ""It’s hard to put into words just how influential she was to the blogosphere. I hope she is at peace, and that her children and loved ones are finding solace where they can."" Author Lyz Lens tweeted that Armstrong showed her that she could self-publish on the internet and write on her own terms without a publisher. ""I was an avid dooce reader and her second and my first kid are similar ages and her writing got me through some very rough times of motherhood and made me feel sane and seen and laugh through tears,"" Lens wrote. Some online said they were saddened by the news, despite having mixed feelings toward Armstrong's blog after a 2022 post, in which she made comments about transgender people that critics described as transphobic. ""I am hit in so many ways hearing of Heather’s death,"" one person tweeted. ""I started reading dooce while I was still Mormon, I was a parenting blogger while she was the biggest, and recently I unfollowed her as she expressed transphobic views. It’s like my whole relationship with the internet."" ""I used to be a huge Dooce fan; her writing about mental health did a lot for me back then,"" another person tweeted. ""She lost me years ago, but I’d check in to see how the kids were doing, and I hoped she’d get help. I am heartbroken for her kids.""

House members to host bipartisan dinner with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,Scott Wong,"May 10, 2023, 2:26 PM UTC / Updated May 10, 2023, 6:04 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats and Republicans will hold a dinner at the Capitol next week with Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, which developed the popular artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, according to an invitation obtained by NBC News. The closed-door, members-only event, planned for Monday night after House votes, comes as Washington tries to figure out how, if at all, to create rules for and regulate the rapidly moving AI industry. The bipartisan dinner is hosted by GOP Conference Vice Chairman Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Democratic Caucus Vice Chairman Ted Lieu of California, who made headlines this year when he introduced a resolution written by ChatGPT that calls on Congress to regulate AI. The goal of the dinner is to “educate members,” said Lieu, who shared the invitation with NBC News. More than 50 lawmakers have RSVP'd, he said. Johnson framed the meeting in more serious terms. ""We've all become aware of the extraordinary potential and unprecedented threat that artificial intelligence presents to humanity and the urgent calls for Congress to engage and act thoughtfully before it's too late,"" Johnson said. ""This bipartisan discussion with Mr. Altman will be a very timely and important part of this process."" The dinner will be one of several appearances on Capitol Hill for Altman. He will testify before Congress for the first time Tuesday, appearing before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy and technology led by Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “Artificial intelligence urgently needs rules and safeguards to address its immense promise and pitfalls,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “This hearing begins our Subcommittee’s work in overseeing and illuminating AI’s advanced algorithms and powerful technology."" Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris convened a meeting at the White House with Altman and other tech CEOs about not only the opportunities but also the potential dangers of emerging generative, self-learning AI technology. The Biden administration that day announced new steps to promote “responsible” AI innovation while protecting people’s rights and safety, including a $140 million investment to create seven AI research institutes. And top lawmakers warn that if Congress doesn’t act soon, the U.S. will fall behind China, which is already moving ahead with proposed regulations for AI. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he has been working with experts and colleagues on a legislative framework that outlines new regulations for AI. Last month, tech billionaire Elon Musk visited Schumer in the Capitol for a discussion that centered on AI. "
U.K. man pleads guilty to hack on Twitter accounts of Joe Biden and Elon Musk,"Ryan Browne, CNBC","May 10, 2023, 1:56 PM UTC",U.S. news,"LONDON — A U.K. man pleaded guilty to helping orchestrate a high-profile hack on the Twitter accounts of numerous celebrities and politicians including Elon Musk, Joe Biden and Kanye West. Joseph O’Connor, 23, who is known under an online alias as “PlugwalkJoe,” submitted his guilty plea in a New York court on Tuesday, according to a Department of Justice press release. He was extradited from Spain last month. O’Connor pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, committing computer intrusions, making extortive and threatening communications, cyberstalking, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Combined, the charges carry a maximum sentence of 77 years, the Justice Department said. Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s criminal division said that O’Connor’s activities were “flagrant and malicious.” “He harassed, threatened, and extorted his victims, causing substantial emotional harm,” he said in a statement Tuesday. “Like many criminal actors, O’Connor tried to stay anonymous by using a computer to hide behind stealth accounts and aliases from outside the United States. But this plea shows that our investigators and prosecutors will identify, locate, and bring to justice such criminals to ensure they face the consequences for their crimes,” Polite added. The attack, which took place in 2020, targeted about 130 people, Twitter said at the time. Hackers took control of the accounts to promote a bitcoin scam, directing users to send the funds to several bitcoin addresses. Twitter said in 2020, shortly after the cyberattack took place, that it believes the hack was a “coordinated social engineering attack” on its employees — in other words, insiders at the company were tricked into handing over access to internal systems and tools. The attackers were able to gain access to Twitter’s internal controls by compromising a small number of employees, according to a July 2020 Twitter blog post. “O’Connor communicated with others regarding purchasing unauthorized access to a variety of Twitter accounts, including accounts associated with public figures around the world,” the Justice Department said Wednesday. “A number of Twitter accounts targeted by O’Connor were subsequently transferred away from their rightful owners. O’Connor agreed to purchase unauthorized access to one Twitter account for $10,000.” O’Connor was also charged and pled guilty for his role in a SIM-swapping attack, which is when an attacker convinces a mobile phone carrier to transfer a person’s phone number to their device to bypass multi-factor authentication on online accounts. The attack targeted several high-profile companies and executives in the cryptocurrency industry including Binance, Tron founder Justin Sun, and Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, and resulted in the theft of $794,000 in digital assets, according to the Justice Department. O’Connor agreed to forfeit the $794,000 to the court and to pay restitution to the victims of his crimes, the Justice Department said. O’Connor also compromised the account of “one of the most highly visible TikTok accounts” and threatened to release sensitive, personal material related to the cyberattack victim to individuals who joined a specified server on the chat app Discord, the Justice Department said. U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California said O’Connor “left an impressive trail of destruction” in the wake of his wave of criminality. “This case serves as a warning that the reach of the law is long, and criminals anywhere who use computers to commit crimes may end up facing the consequences of their actions in places they did not anticipate,” Ramsey said. O’Connor was one of four individuals charged over the scheme. In 2021, American teenager Graham Ivan Clark pleaded guilty to fraud charges. Nima Fazeli of Orlando, Florida, and Mason Sheppard, of Bognor Regis in the U.K. have also been charged in relation to the hack. O’Connor was arrested in July 2021 in Estepona, a resort town on the Costa del Sol in southern Spain, by Spanish National Police at the request of U.S. authorities. He is scheduled to be sentenced June 23. "
Hackers to test limits of AI technology at Las Vegas event,Associated Press,"May 10, 2023, 1:43 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"No sooner did ChatGPT get unleashed than hackers started “jailbreaking” the artificial intelligence chatbot — trying to override its safeguards so it could blurt out something unhinged or obscene. But now its maker, OpenAI, and other major AI providers such as Google and Microsoft, are coordinating with the Biden administration to let thousands of hackers take a shot at testing the limits of their technology. Some of the things they’ll be looking to find: How can chatbots be manipulated to cause harm? Will they share the private information we confide in them to other users? And why do they assume a doctor is a man and a nurse is a woman? “This is why we need thousands of people,” said Rumman Chowdhury, lead coordinator of the mass hacking event planned for this summer’s DEF CON hacker convention in Las Vegas that’s expected to draw several thousand people. “We need a lot of people with a wide range of lived experiences, subject matter expertise and backgrounds hacking at these models and trying to find problems that can then go be fixed.” Anyone who’s tried ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing chatbot or Google’s Bard will have quickly learned that they have a tendency to fabricate information and confidently present it as fact. These systems, built on what’s known as large language models, also emulate the cultural biases they’ve learned from being trained upon huge troves of what people have written online. The idea of a mass hack caught the attention of U.S. government officials in March at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, where Sven Cattell, founder of DEF CON’s long-running AI Village, and Austin Carson, president of responsible AI nonprofit SeedAI, helped lead a workshop inviting community college students to hack an AI model. Carson said those conversations eventually blossomed into a proposal to test AI language models following the guidelines of the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights — a set of principles to limit the impacts of algorithmic bias, give users control over their data and ensure that automated systems are used safely and transparently. There’s already a community of users trying their best to trick chatbots and highlight their flaws. Some are official “red teams” authorized by the companies to “prompt attack” the AI models to discover their vulnerabilities. Many others are hobbyists showing off humorous or disturbing outputs on social media until they get banned for violating a product’s terms of service. “What happens now is kind of a scattershot approach where people find stuff, it goes viral on Twitter,” and then it may or may not get fixed if it’s egregious enough or the person calling attention to it is influential, Chowdhury said. In one example, known as the “grandma exploit,” users were able to get chatbots to tell them how to make a bomb — a request a commercial chatbot would normally decline — by asking it to pretend it was a grandmother telling a bedtime story about how to make a bomb. In another example, searching for Chowdhury using an early version of Microsoft’s Bing search engine chatbot — which is based on the same technology as ChatGPT but can pull real-time information from the internet — led to a profile that speculated Chowdhury “loves to buy new shoes every month” and made strange and gendered assertions about her physical appearance. Chowdhury helped introduce a method for rewarding the discovery of algorithmic bias to DEF CON’s AI Village in 2021 when she was the head of Twitter’s AI ethics team — a job that has since been eliminated upon Elon Musk’s October takeover of the company. Paying hackers a “bounty” if they uncover a security bug is commonplace in the cybersecurity industry — but it was a newer concept to researchers studying harmful AI bias. This year’s event will be at a much greater scale, and is the first to tackle the large language models that have attracted a surge of public interest and commercial investment since the release of ChatGPT late last year. Chowdhury, now the co-founder of AI accountability nonprofit Humane Intelligence, said it’s not just about finding flaws but about figuring out ways to fix them. “This is a direct pipeline to give feedback to companies,” she said. “It’s not like we’re just doing this hackathon and everybody’s going home. We’re going to be spending months after the exercise compiling a report, explaining common vulnerabilities, things that came up, patterns we saw.” Some of the details are still being negotiated, but companies that have agreed to provide their models for testing include OpenAI, Google, chipmaker Nvidia and startups Anthropic, Hugging Face and Stability AI. Building the platform for the testing is another startup called Scale AI, known for its work in assigning humans to help train AI models by labeling data. “As these foundation models become more and more widespread, it’s really critical that we do everything we can to ensure their safety,” said Scale CEO Alexandr Wang. “You can imagine somebody on one side of the world asking it some very sensitive or detailed questions, including some of their personal information. You don’t want any of that information leaking to any other user.” Other dangers Wang worries about are chatbots that give out “unbelievably bad medical advice” or other misinformation that can cause serious harm. Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark said the DEF CON event will hopefully be the start of a deeper commitment from AI developers to measure and evaluate the safety of the systems they are building. “Our basic view is that AI systems will need third-party assessments, both before deployment and after deployment. Red-teaming is one way that you can do that,” Clark said. “We need to get practice at figuring out how to do this. It hasn’t really been done before.” "
Tucker Carlson says he'll launch new show on Twitter,Tim Stelloh,"May 9, 2023, 9:30 PM UTC / Updated May 10, 2023, 1:34 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Conservative commentator and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is launching a new version of his show on Twitter, he said Tuesday. Speaking in a nearly three-minute video posted on the platform, Carlson gave few details about the show and offered a familiar criticism of the news media. Carlson called the platform the ""last big one remaining in the world"" for free speech. ""Twitter isn’t a partisan site,"" he said. ""Everyone is allowed here.” Twitter CEO Elon Musk said Carlson would be subject to the same ""rules & rewards"" of all users, including subscription revenue and ""Community Notes,"" the platform's content moderation feature. ""I also want to be clear that we have not signed a deal of any kind whatsoever,"" Musk said. Early Wednesday morning, Musk tweeted at former CNN anchor Don Lemon in an attempt to get him do to a show on Twitter as well. ""Have you considered doing your show on this platform? Maybe worth a try,"" Musk said. ""Audience is much bigger."" Carlson and Fox “agreed to part ways” last month for reasons that neither he nor the network specified after the network announced it had agreed to pay nearly $800 million to Dominion Voting Systems after the company sued Fox for defamation. A Fox spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Carlson’s lawyer also did not respond to a request for comment. “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” which had aired on Fox News since 2016, was one of the most-watched shows on American cable news. Carlson was known for promoting conspiracy theories and disinformation, such as the racist “great replacement” theory, found on fringe sites like 4chan. Carlson also used his platform to target people. A former producer for Carlson, Abby Grossberg, has alleged in a lawsuit that he fostered a work environment that “subjugated women based on vile sexist stereotypes, typecasted religious minorities and belittled their traditions, and demonstrated little to no regard for mental health.” A spokeswoman for the network has disputed Grossberg’s claims, saying they are “riddled with false allegations."" Carlson is moving to Twitter as Musk’s public persona has veered sharply to the right and he has dabbled in fringe conspiracy theories in recent years, as detailed in his prolific tweeting. On Tuesday, Musk pushed a discredited theory that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg swung the 2020 election and cast doubt on reporting that showed the man who recently killed eight people at a Dallas-area mall was linked to extremist social media posts.

"CNBC anchor Hadley Gamble, who accused former NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell of sexual harassment, leaving company",Daniel Arkin,"May 9, 2023, 8:03 PM UTC",News,"Hadley Gamble, the CNBC anchor who accused former NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell of sexual harassment and sex discrimination, is leaving the company, a spokesperson for the financial news network said Tuesday. “Gamble has been a distinguished journalist for more than a decade for CNBC, undertaking highly visible and challenging assignments, and developing deep expertise in the Middle East and beyond,” the CNBC spokesperson said in a statement. “Her initiative and drive have secured valuable interviews with several world political leaders,” the spokesperson added. “We wish her every success in her future endeavors.” The spokesperson did not say why Gamble was leaving. The news about Gamble’s departure came more than two weeks after Shell left the company following an outside legal counsel investigation into allegations of “inappropriate conduct.” (NBC News and CNBC are both units of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast.) Gamble’s lawyer, Suzanne McKie, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on her client’s departure. Gamble did not immediately respond to an email at her company account or a message on Twitter. Shell did not immediately respond to an email. In a Securities and Exchange Commission document filed last month, Comcast wrote: “Following a complaint that Jeffrey Shell, CEO of NBCUniversal, engaged in inappropriate conduct with a female employee, including allegations of sexual harassment, Comcast Corporation (the “Company”) retained outside counsel to investigate the allegations. “During the investigation, evidence was uncovered that corroborated the allegations,” the filing went on to say. “As a consequence, on April 23, 2023, the Company terminated Mr. Shell’s employment With Cause under his employment agreement, effective immediately.” Gamble covered energy, geopolitics and financial markets, according to a profile on CNBC’s website. She was the anchor of CNBC’s “Capital Connection,” a show that broadcast daily from the network’s Middle East headquarters in the United Arab Emirates. Shell was named as successor to former NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke in late 2019 and formally stepped into the role in January 2020. He was previously the chairman of the company’s film and entertainment unit. He oversaw a sprawling portfolio of media assets that includes the Universal Pictures film studio, the Peacock streaming service and cable channels such as Bravo, E! and the USA Network. "
Leaked Google engineer memo warns that Big Tech could lose AI race to the little guys,Kevin Collier,"May 9, 2023, 6:46 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"A leaked memo from a Google employee makes a bold claim that’s taking hold in Silicon Valley and beyond: Big Tech’s advantage in artificial intelligence is shrinking quickly. The memo, published Thursday on the website for the tech research firm SemiAnalysis, soon became a top story on AI forums, including the popular HackerNews message board and Reddit’s /r/MachineLearning community, which has more than 2.6 million members, and sparked commentary from some of the biggest names in AI. A Google spokesperson confirmed the memo was authentic but said it was the opinion of one senior employee, not necessarily the company as a whole. “We’ve done a lot of looking over our shoulders at OpenAI,” the memo said. “But the uncomfortable truth is, we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI.” “I’m talking, of course, about open source. Plainly put, they are lapping us,” it continued. “While our models still hold a slight edge in terms of quality, the gap is closing astonishingly quickly.” Tech companies spent years developing AI in a behind-the-scenes arms race, only to see OpenAI burst onto the scene with the release of ChatGPT. Other generative AI systems, which can create content based on a user’s prompt, have skyrocketed in popularity and quality. OpenAI announced a massive deal with Google competitor Microsoft in January. In response, Google rushed to release its counterpart program,  Bard. And while those companies are working to integrate AI into many parts of their existing businesses, that doesn’t mean the technology will further solidify their grip on the tech industry. The Google employee wrote that both Google and Microsoft have neglected the growing  community of programmers and companies that rely on publicly available AI code and models — referred to as “open-source” — to create smaller but more efficient projects. Some experts and industry analysts agreed with the memo’s warning. Andrej Karpathy, an OpenAI founder who rejoined the company in February, wrote on Twitter Saturday that the surge of small AI companies competing with tech giants was starting to massively shake up the industry. That ecosystem is “experiencing early signs of a cambrian explosion,” he wrote, a reference to a period of Earth history, more than 500 million years ago, marked by rapid and diverse evolution of life. Open source refers to software code that is released publically for anyone to build on or customize. While most large tech companies keep their internal programs a tightly held corporate secret, open source communities share, tinker and collaborate with each other. Popular open source programs include the Firefox browser and VLC media player. The open source AI community received a giant and unexpected gift earlier this year, when an unknown person leaked Facebook owner Meta’s equivalent to ChatGPT, LLaMa — which still has not been formally introduced to the public — onto the message board 4chan. That leak gave open source AI programmers a foundation for their own, more customized projects. “TL;DR: AI can’t be stopped because anyone can play with it, and the whole discussion of ‘guardrails’ and ‘moratoria’ is academic,” tweeted Pedro Domingos, a professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Washington. A key point lies in how much data is needed to train an AI system, once considered a major challenge for smaller developers. Simon Willison, a programmer and tech analyst and blogger, told NBC News that while OpenAI’s flagship product, ChatGPT-4, is still leading the industry, not every AI product needs to be built on the massive troves of data that it has been until now. “I don’t think I need something as powerful as GPT-4 for a lot of things that I want to do,” Willison said. “I want models that can do the thing that Bing and Bard does, where if it doesn’t know something, it can run a search.” “The open question I have right now is, how small can the model be while still being useful?” he said. “That’s something which the open source community is figuring out really, really quickly.” Mark Riedl, a computer scientist and professor at Georgia Tech, said that major tech companies ceding their AI advantage to individual programmers and small companies would likely democratize the technology for society’s benefit, but could also lead to malicious use. “Largely, I think people are trying to do good with these things, make people more productive or are making experiences better,” he said. “You don’t want a monopoly, or even a small set of companies kind of controlling everything. And I think you’ll see a greater level of creativity by putting these tools into the hands of more people.” “It really now becomes the question of what are people going to use these things for.” Riedl said. “There’s really no restrictions on making specialized versions of models that are designed specifically to create toxic material, or misinformation, or to spread hate on the internet.” "
FBI says it has sabotaged hacking tool created by elite Russian spies,Reuters,"May 9, 2023, 4:48 PM UTC",Security,"The FBI has sabotaged a suite of malicious software used by elite Russian spies, U.S. authorities said on Tuesday, providing a glimpse of the digital tug-of-war between two cyber superpowers. Senior law enforcement officials said FBI technical experts had identified and disabled malware wielded by Russia’s FSB security service against an undisclosed number of American computers, a move they hoped would deal a death blow to one of Russia’s leading cyber spying programs. “We assess this as being their premier espionage tool,” one of the U.S. officials told journalists ahead of the release. He said Washington hoped the operation would “eradicate it from the virtual battlefield.” The official said the FSB spies behind the malware, known as Snake, are part of a notorious hacking group tracked by the private sector and known as “Turla.” The group has been active for two decades against a variety of NATO-aligned targets, U.S. government agencies and technology companies, a senior FBI official said. Russian diplomats did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Moscow routinely denies carrying out cyberespionage operations. U.S. officials spoke to journalists on Tuesday ahead of the news release on condition that they not be named. Similar announcements, revealing the FSB cyber disruption effort, were made by security agencies in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Turla is widely considered one of the most sophisticated hacking teams studied by the security research community. “They have persisted in the shadows by focusing on stealth and operational security,” said John Hultquist, vice president of threat analysis at U.S. cybersecurity company Mandiant. “They are one of the hardest targets we have.” "
"Teens should be trained in media literacy and limit their screen time, psychologists say in new guidelines",Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 9, 2023, 4:01 AM UTC",Culture & Trends,"The American Psychological Association released a set of 10 recommendations for adolescents’ use of social media Tuesday, including training them in media literacy and limiting screen time so it does not interfere with sleep or physical activity. The guidelines acknowledge that teenagers are going to use social media no matter what, so the organization said it aims to offer suggestions for adolescents and the parents, teachers and tech companies involved in their lives. Other recommendations include: tailoring social media use to young people’s developmental capabilities, screening routinely for “problematic social media use” and limiting how much teens use social media to compare people’s beauty or appearance. “There is a lot of talk about social media these days, including some suggestions that do not fit with the science,” said APA chief science officer Mitch Prinstein, a co-chair of the advisory panel that developed the recommendations. “We are releasing this report now to offer a science-based and balanced perspective on this issue so all stakeholders can make decisions based on our expertise regarding benefits and potential risks associated with social media.” Experts who made the suggestions hail from various areas in psychology, Prinstein said. They analyzed the latest research to determine where science has reached a consensus about teens and social media, he said. While some of the experts’ recommendations are practical, like providing teens with resources about the positive and negative sides of social media, others are more nebulous, such as minimizing teens’ exposure to “cyberhate.” Prinstein compared teens’ social media use to driving a car, in that keeping adolescents safe should be a team effort that includes policymaking, parental supervision and changes from the companies that make the products. “Social media is here to stay,” Prinstein said. “So we need to teach kids how to get the best they can from it and avoid the worst.” Social media is here to stay. So we need to teach kids how to get the best they can from it and avoid the worst. — Mitch Prinstein, co-chair of the advisory panel that developed the recommendations Concern has been rising over what young people consume on social media and how it affects their views of themselves. Politicians and lawmakers have put the companies behind social media apps such as Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat under increased scrutiny amid reports that some users have struggled with body image issues and suicidal ideation, among other mental health effects. Last month, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation that would require social media users to be at least 13 years old and mandate parental consent for users ages 13 to 17. Legal cases against some social media companies are also making their way through the judicial system. One class-action suit, which consolidates more than 100 similar cases, alleges that social media is harmful to younger users and likens its addictiveness to that of opioids or tobacco. The new recommendations target a variety of stakeholders: parents, educators, tech companies and adolescents themselves. The hope, Prinstein said, is that the parties collaborate to help young users have positive outcomes when they use social media. Emma Woodward, a clinical psychologist with the nonprofit Child Mind Institute, said the recommendations are most likely to be useful to people who interact with teens every day, like parents and teachers. She suggested turning the individual guidelines into conversation starters with teens. “I certainly think the best way to help kids be safe online is for it to be a collaboration between parents and their kids or their teens,” said Woodward, who was not involved in creating the recommendations. “That collaboration is probably going to lead to the most success in terms of helping kids use social media safely.” Woodward said she is glad the recommendations reflect an understanding that teens will use social media regardless of whether parents, educators or tech platforms step in. But she said that, while they are admirable, some of the guidelines might be hard to put into practice — like avoiding cyber hate. “While of course I think it’s very aspirational to avoid cyber hate at all, I think it’s also something that the vast, vast majority of kids and teens who use social media are probably going to come across,” she said. Prinstein said the guidelines are intended not to vilify social media but rather to offer a safer approach. “It absolutely was important that we reflect the science accurately, and that includes discussing both the benefits and the potential warning signs that we’re seeing related to social media use,” he said. In a report accompanying the recommendations, the authors said that social media “is not inherently beneficial or harmful to young people” and that those who use it in moderation and in ways that help cultivate their offline communities are likely to benefit from connections made on it. The recommendations also acknowledge that young people who are struggling with mental illness, such as social anxiety, may benefit from interacting with others on social media. However, the authors added that that group could also experience the harms of social media, such as viewing content that encourages disordered eating or self-harm. "
Biden calls for 'fair deal' for striking Hollywood writers,The Associated Press,"May 9, 2023, 2:27 AM UTC",White House,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden called for a “fair deal” for Hollywood’s striking writers on Monday as he hosted a White House screening of the the upcoming streaming series “American Born Chinese” to mark Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Biden made his first public comments on the strike, which hits the one-week mark Tuesday, in remarks ahead of the pilot’s screening. He was joined by an overflow crowd of hundreds of community leaders, elected officials and cast members and producers from the show in the East Room and the State Dining Room. “Nights like these are a reminder of stories and the importance of treating storytellers with the dignity, respect and the value they deserve,” Biden said. “I sincerely hope the writers strike in Hollywood gets resolved and the writers are given a fair deal they deserve as soon as possible.” He added: “This is an iconic, meaningful American industry. And we need the writers and all the workers and everyone involved to tell the stories of our nation and the stories of all of us.” “American Born Chinese” is an adaptation of a graphic novel of the same name by Gene Luen Yang, and stars Oscar winners Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. It will premiere on Disney+ May 24. Biden used his brief remarks onstage to outline his administration’s efforts to highlight the accomplishments of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities and to speak out against prejudice and violence targeting them. “Hate can have no safe harbor in America,” Biden said. “Silence is complicity and we will not remain silent” Quan, who introduced Biden, reflected on his journey from arriving in the U.S. as an 8-year-old refugee from Vietnam to making his first visit to the White House months after winning an Oscar. “I do not take this moment lightly, because I know this building is a monument to a country that opened its arms to me,” he said.

A TikTok ‘investigator’ faces fallout after claiming to crack a serial killer case,Daysia Tolentino,"May 8, 2023, 9:29 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Since early March, Ken Waks, a TikTok creator with 1 million followers, had been pursuing an investigation into a potential serial killer working in various cities in the U.S. The Chicago-based marketer has claimed that someone — or even a group of people — has been targeting men walking home from a bar or club at night and dumping them in rivers across the country. However, Waks soon became an object of scrutiny himself, with other TikTok users now referring to his case as a “Kentroversy.” Like many true crime sensations, his series garnered a lot of support and millions of views. But many viewers started to get suspicious when in late April Waks posted videos claiming that a private investigator had showed up to his house and recruited him into a team looking into the “Smiley Face Killers.” The Smiley Face Killer case is a true crime theory alleging one or more killers murdered and dumped dozens of men into rivers; the investigation on this case was spearheaded by former New York Police Department detective Kevin Gannon. (A “Smiley Face Killers” docuseries was released on Oxygen, which is owned by NBC Universal.) “The stories just started to get so big that I had to pause,” Meredith Lynch, a pop culture TikToker with 227,000 followers said of Waks' videos. Lynch and others online then began expressing public skepticism toward Waks after they noticed he mentioned Foresyte, a social calendar startup where he worked as chief marketing officer, in two videos about his amateur detective pursuits. Critics called his motivations into question, sparking a debate on creator ethics. Enthusiasts online have argued that true crime content can draw attention to unreported cases and help investigators. However, critics of so-called TikTok sleuthing have grown weary of the genre because they argue creators may inhibit investigations, exacerbate families’ pain and capitalize on other people’s traumas. Waks told NBC News in an email statement that he started his series because he wanted to raise awareness about a potential public safety issue in Chicago. He said he was approached on two occasions by an individual trying to lure him into a car while he was walking home from a bar. NBC News reviewed the police report Waks filed regarding the incidents. “I quickly learned that this was happening to many others in the Chicago area and beyond,” he said. “I began diligently collecting information and sharing it online, as well as with law enforcement, private investigators and other authorities in an attempt to bring awareness to these crimes.” NBC News reviewed emails sent by a spokesperson for Waks that appear to show communication between him, private detective Jordan Scherer and Gannon discussing his research. The stories just started to get so big that I had to pause. — Meredith Lynch, a pop culture TikToker Scherer, owner of R.A. Private Investigation and Security, confirmed in a phone interview that he connected with Waks to see if his research could be useful. He clarified that his team was not working in partnership with Waks, who is an unlicensed citizen. “Him and his team are offering us research and data points that may provide assistance that may be helpful in our investigations to these ongoing suspicious deaths,” Scherer said. After seeing a now-deleted post from the CEO of Foresyte, viewers began to wonder if Waks’ series was just a marketing ploy to direct traffic to his startup. The post praised Waks’ organic integration of Foresyte into his recent viral content, which included videos about his investigation. On Saturday, a Foresyte spokesperson said Waks and Foresyte have made the “amicable decision to part ways.” The statement came days after the spokesperson had said Waks’ “work and involvement in that case is entirely his own and our company is not involved in any capacity.” “We have never actively monitored or dictated employee’s personal social media accounts, and while we were initially excited by the potential increase in visibility and even celebrated it on LinkedIn, we have since learned the fuller details of the situation and have ensured moving forward that employees understand the importance of maintaining a clear separation between our company and personal matters in any public forum,” a Foresyte spokesperson said in an email statement last week. Justin Burnett, a TikToker with 15,000 followers, said Waks “made an example of himself” but believes the incident is “something that people can learn from.” “This is a person who’s influencing 1.1 million people and his followers, his reach is ginormous,” Burnett said. Waks’ follower count has since fallen back to 1 million amid the fallout from his investigation. Burnett, a military police veteran with investigation experience, was initially optimistic about Waks’ series on TikTok. However, after Waks declared that he had “cracked the case,” Burnett felt like some of his claims weren’t adding up and warned against content creators “gaining clout off of people’s misfortunes.” “When you do things like this, you actively impede the logistics of police,” he said. “They’re gonna get people who get hysterical, tip lines get flooded and it’s so hard to sift through that information.” Burnett also said that videos like Waks’ can be insensitive to grieving families who are still looking for answers about their deceased loved ones. Burnett said creators need to ask themselves: “Is what I’m doing causing harm?” Burnett, Lynch and other critics have argued that Waks’ videos are harmful to the families of the deceased men included in his investigation. Jane Polhill, whose son Jay died in 2010 in Chicago, attests to this. Since her son’s body was found in the Calumet River in Chicago 13 years ago, Polhill has been searching for answers about his death. She stumbled upon Waks’ series while scrolling on TikTok one day, and she thought Waks could help her. “My husband said … don’t get your hopes up,” Polhill said in a phone interview. “You know, because when you get your hopes up, it just seems like in our experience, you’re gonna be disappointed.” Still, Polhill emailed Waks information about her son, and she said she noticed that he added Jay’s name into his public database. However, she said her emails were left unanswered. Desperate for potential information about her son’s death, she said she paid for a 15-minute Zoom meeting with Waks, which was offered via a link in his bio for $30. When he didn’t show, Polhill said she felt duped, angry and embarrassed. A spokesperson for Waks said he “missed this appointment because of a defunct calendar and contacted the mother to apologize.” The link to buy time on Waks’ calendar appears to be taken down. “He was absolutely willing and wanted to meet with her,” a representative for Waks said. Polhill confirmed that Waks apologized and that she received a refund. However, she said she didn’t believe Waks’ investigation was “truthful or sincere.” She added that she hopes that other parents didn’t try to get Waks’ help. Polhill said she believes a more ethical way to approach true crime is to loop in the affected families from the start. “I think communication between the creator and the families is a must,” she said. “Because some families are going to say yes and some families are gonna say no, and that needs to be respected.” After receiving backlash online, Waks made a TikTok on Thursday announcing that he would stop his investigation. “My reporting on this topic has since turned into a contentious subject and I now realize that it’s not my place at all to continue chasing this story despite my own personal connection to it with those two attempts on me,” he said in the video. Waks continued by saying he “bit off a lot” with the investigation and got “lost in the sauce” with his pursuits. He also apologized to the families impacted by his series and for incorporating his startup into his content. In an email statement, Waks said he was handing over his information to the authorities. “As it relates to the case, I’ve been in contact with the Chicago Police Department about my discoveries throughout this process,” he said, “and am working closely with a team of private investigators to hand over all the data and work I’ve done over the past two months so that they can use their time and resources to give this case the attention it deserves.” CORRECTION (May 8, 2023, 6:55 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the name of the company where Waks worked as chief marketing officer. It is Foresyte, not Forsyte. "
Graphic videos spread on Twitter following Texas shooting and SUV incident,Jason Abbruzzese,"May 8, 2023, 8:16 PM UTC",Tech News,"Graphic videos and images of the aftermath of two bloody events this weekend in Texas — a shooting at a mall and a car plowing into a group of migrants — circulated widely on Twitter over the last couple of days, generating renewed concern about the platform's moderation capabilities under CEO Elon Musk. It was imagery that some users said was pushed into their ""For You"" feed, which was introduced earlier this year and surfaces content based on Twitter's recommendation system and a user's preferences based on who they follow. Users can choose between the ""For You"" feed and the ""Following"" feed, which only shows tweets from accounts that a user follows. David Hogg, a gun control advocate and Parkland shooting survivor, tweeted on Sunday (in response to a poll from Musk asking if he had succeeded in improving the platform in the last six months) that graphic images had been pushed into his ""For You"" feed. ""Well I saw a significantly higher number of photos and videos of dead people from the most recent mass shooting in Texas on my For you page and timeline yesterday than I ever had seen before,"" Hogg tweeted. ""So not great in that respect."" That concern was offset by some calls for the graphic images to be more widely distributed, a decades-old argument that has gained some renewed momentum in recent years around the gun control debate. ""The entire genre of photos and videos of violent attacks is fraught with peril,"" said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute. ""On the one hand, many or most people don’t want to see it. On the other hand, it can be critical evidence of what’s happened and in some cases it can shock people into changing their views. We both want and don’t want that content to be widely available."" “That puts the internet services in a no-win situation,"" he added. The Allen mall videos, which NBC News has seen and is electing not to link to or embed, show mangled bodies piled on each other just outside the mall, many covered in blood. Twitter’s “sensitive media policy” states that users “may not post media that is graphic or share violent or adult nudity and sexual behavior within live video or in profile header, List banner images, or Community cover photos. Media depicting excessively gory content, sexual violence and/or assault, bestiality or necrophilia is also not permitted.” Twitter does allow for users to post “sensitive” media if they mark their account as such, which puts images and videos behind a warning that must be clicked on before the media is displayed. It’s not clear how many employees Twitter has to enforce those rules. Musk has said he laid off about 80% of the company’s staff, with NBC News reporting that the company’s moderation teams were cut back. Searches of Twitter on Monday morning turned up a wide variety of unmoderated videos with no content warnings that would appear to violate those rules, including videos of pornography. Goldman said he doesn’t know what Musk’s motive is but pointed to the company's pullback on moderation. ""Content moderation is hard enough when you do it well,"" he said, adding that the company has ways to host such videos while also shielding users. ""The question is, why didn’t Twitter put this behind a warning screen and was that the wrong choice?"" Ella Irwin, Twitter’s vice president of product overseeing trust and safety, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the videos from the mall shooting. Musk tweeted throughout the weekend, at times touching on the shooting to support mental health efforts. YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said in an email that the company’s trust and safety teams removed videos from the weekend mall shooting that violated the company’s community guidelines. Other less graphic video showed white sheets covering dead bodies surrounded by blood. Another video from a car's dashcam showed the moment a man opened fire at the mall. Other videos came from people inside the mall who documented their efforts to hide until help came. Videos from Brownsville, Texas, where eight people died and 10 others were injured by an SUV, also showed a brutal and bloody scene. Some of those videos remain live on Twitter and have been seen by NBC News. In the case of the graphic mall shooting video, many accounts posted it to Twitter in the hours after the incident. As of Monday morning, a search of Twitter showed that most of those tweets had been deleted, though it was not entirely clear if they had been deleted by those users or by Twitter. The videos generated a swift reaction from many users, some of whom tweeted at Musk directly and asking him to take action. That sentiment as not unanimous. Other users pushed for the videos to be seen by more people, arguing that the disturbing images need to be seen in order for people to fully understand the magnitude of these violent actions and the widespread availability of guns in the U.S. It's a point that has found some growing traction as the broader issue of gun regulation remains frozen. ""I thought long and hard about whether to share the horrific video showing the pile of bodies from the mass shooting at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas,"" tweeted Jon Cooper, a Democratic fundraiser who has worked for President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama. ""But maybe — just maybe — people NEED to see this video, so they’ll pressure their elected officials until they TAKE ACTION,"" he added. Jamelle Bouie, a New York Times opinion columnist, also said he thinks people need to see the aftermath of these shootings, but that it is also important who sees them. “Years ago I wrote that the public needs to see the results of our experiment in unlimited gun ownership and I still think that’s true. That includes the Supreme Court,” Bouie tweeted. Emily Bell, founding director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, offered a counterpoint. ""There is nothing virtuous or ethical about showing easily identifiable dead children and adults, whose families might not yet know they are dead,"" Bell tweeted. ""It’s deeply unethical — it strips victims and their families of privacy and dignity in death. It serves only Musk’s click farm."" The open circulation of graphic videos in the aftermath of violent events is a common occurrence on social media, and one that many consumer tech platforms have worked to limit through a combination of human intervention and automated systems that can identify when certain pieces of media are repeatedly posted. Many consumer tech companies have invested in efforts to limit the spread of graphic images, most notably in the aftermath of violent events. But most also have policies that allow them to weigh whether a particular video is important for the public to see. Among the most notable examples happened around video from the shooter who killed 49 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, with Twitter and YouTube scrambling to remove copies that were repeatedly uploaded. Such videos are typically regarded as violent propaganda. More recently, YouTube allowed police body camera video from a school shooting to remain online, with the company stating that the video was in the public interest. Goldman said thinking around moderation has changed since the Christchurch shooting and noted examples of graphic photos that are now seen as having historical important, such as the ""Napalm Girl"" photo. ""Seeing that photo helped change American views about the Vietnam War,"" he said. Still, Goldman said there is not a clear consensus on what platforms need to be doing around videos like the ones that emerged this last weekend. ""The content moderation dilemmas that are faced by the internet companies in those circumstances — they cannot please everybody,"" he said. ""I feel like this is another moment like that."" "
ChatGPT is powered by these contractors making $15 an hour,David Ingram,"May 6, 2023, 3:00 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Alexej Savreux, a 34-year-old in Kansas City, says he’s done all kinds of work over the years. He’s made fast-food sandwiches. He’s been a custodian and a junk-hauler. And he’s done technical sound work for live theater. These days, though, his work is less hands-on: He’s an artificial intelligence trainer. Savreux is part of a hidden army of contract workers who have been doing the behind-the-scenes labor of teaching AI systems how to analyze data so they can generate the kinds of text and images that have wowed the people using newly popular products like ChatGPT. To improve the accuracy of AI, he has labeled photos and made predictions about what text the apps should generate next. The pay: $15 an hour and up, with no benefits. Out of the limelight, Savreux and other contractors have spent countless hours in the past few years teaching OpenAI’s systems to give better responses in ChatGPT. Their feedback fills an urgent and endless need for the company and its AI competitors: providing streams of sentences, labels and other information that serve as training data. “We are grunt workers, but there would be no AI language systems without it,” said Savreux, who’s done work for tech startups including OpenAI, the San Francisco company that released ChatGPT in November and set off a wave of hype around generative AI. “You can design all the neural networks you want, you can get all the researchers involved you want, but without labelers, you have no ChatGPT. You have nothing,” Savreux said. It’s not a job that will give Savreux fame or riches, but it’s an essential and often overlooked one in the field of AI, where the seeming magic of a new technological frontier can overshadow the labor of contract workers. “A lot of the discourse around AI is very congratulatory,” said Sonam Jindal, the program lead for AI, labor and the economy at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that promotes research and education around artificial intelligence. “But we’re missing a big part of the story: that this is still hugely reliant on a large human workforce,” she said. The tech industry has for decades relied on the labor of thousands of lower-skilled, lower-paid workers to build its computer empires: from punch-card operators in the 1950s to more recent Google contractors who’ve complained about second-class status, including yellow badges that set them apart from full-time employees. Online gig work through sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk grew even more popular early in the pandemic. Now, the burgeoning AI industry is following a similar playbook. The work is defined by its unsteady, on-demand nature, with people employed by written contracts either directly by a company or through a third-party vendor that specializes in temp work or outsourcing. Benefits such as health insurance are rare or nonexistent — which translates to lower costs for tech companies — and the work is usually anonymous, with all the credit going to tech startup executives and researchers. The Partnership on AI warned in a 2021 report that a spike in demand was coming for what it called “data enrichment work.” It recommended that the industry commit to fair compensation and other improved practices, and last year it published voluntary guidelines for companies to follow. DeepMind, an AI subsidiary of Google, is so far the only tech company to publicly commit to those guidelines. “A lot of people have recognized that this is important to do. The challenge now is to get companies to do it,” Jindal said. “This is a new job that’s being created by AI,” she added. “We have the potential for this to be a high-quality job and for workers who are doing this work to be respected and valued for their contributions to enabling this advancement.” A spike in demand has arrived, and some AI contract workers are asking for more. In Nairobi, Kenya, more than 150 people who’ve worked on AI for Facebook, TikTok and ChatGPT voted Monday to form a union, citing low pay and the mental toll of the work, Time magazine reported. Facebook and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the vote. OpenAI declined to comment. So far, AI contract work hasn’t inspired a similar movement in the U.S. among the Americans quietly building AI systems word-by-word. Savreux, who works from home on a laptop, got into AI contracting after seeing an online job posting. He credits the AI gig work — along with a previous job at the sandwich chain Jimmy John’s — with helping to pull him out of homelessness. “People sometimes minimize these necessary, laborious jobs,” he said. “It’s the necessary, entry-level area of machine learning.” The $15 an hour is more than the minimum wage in Kansas City. Job postings for AI contractors refer to both the allure of working in a cutting-edge industry as well as the sometimes-grinding nature of the work. An advertisement from Invisible Technologies, a temp agency, for an “Advanced AI Data Trainer” notes that the job would be entry level with pay starting at $15 an hour, but also that it could be “beneficial to humanity.” “Think of it like being a language arts teacher or a personal tutor for some of the world’s most influential technology,” the job posting says. It doesn’t name Invisible’s client, but it says the new hire would work “within protocols developed by the world’s leading AI researchers.” Invisible did not immediately respond to a request for more information on its listings. There’s no definitive tally of how many contractors work for AI companies, but it’s an increasingly common form of work around the world. Time magazine reported in January that OpenAI relied on low-wage Kenyan laborers to label text that included hate speech or sexually abusive language so that its apps could do better at recognizing toxic content on their own. OpenAI has hired about 1,000 remote contractors in places such as Eastern Europe and Latin America to label data or train company software on computer engineering tasks, the online news outlet Semafor reported in January. OpenAI is still a small company, with some 375 employees as of January, CEO Sam Altman said on Twitter, but that number doesn’t include contractors and doesn’t reflect the full scale of the operation or its ambitions. A spokesperson for OpenAI said no one was available to answer questions about its use of AI contractors. The work of creating data to train AI models isn’t always simple to do, and sometimes it’s complex enough to attract would-be AI entrepreneurs. Jatin Kumar, a 22-year-old in Austin, Texas, said he’s been doing AI work on contract for a year since he graduated college with a degree in computer science, and he said it gives him a sneak peak into where generative AI technology is headed in the near-term. “What it allows you to do is start thinking about ways to use this technology before it hits public markets,” Kumar said. He’s also working on his own tech startup, Bonsai, which is making software to help with hospital billing. A conversational trainer, Kumar said his main work has been generating prompts: participating in a back-and-forth conversation with chatbot technology that’s part of the long process of training AI systems. The tasks have grown more complex with experience, he said, but they started off very simple. “Every 45 or 30 minutes, you’d get a new task, generating new prompts,” he said. The prompts might be as simple as, “What is the capital of France?” he said. Kumar said he worked with about 100 other contractors on tasks to generate training data, correct answers and fine-tune the model by giving feedback on answers. He said other workers handled “flagged” conversations: reading over examples submitted by ChatGPT users who, for one reason or another, reported the chatbot’s answer back to the company for review. When a flagged conversation comes in, he said, it’s sorted based on the type of error involved and then used in further training of the AI models. “Initially, it started off as a way for me to help out at OpenAI and learn about existing technologies,” Kumar said. “But now, I can’t see myself stepping away from this role.” "
VP Harris to meet with CEOs about artificial intelligence risks,Associated Press,"May 4, 2023, 1:49 PM UTC / Updated May 5, 2023, 1:35 AM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Vice President Kamala Harris will meet on Thursday with the CEOs of four major companies developing artificial intelligence as the Biden administration rolls out a set of initiatives meant to ensure the rapidly evolving technology improves lives without putting people’s rights and safety at risk. The Democratic administration plans to announce an investment of $140 million to establish seven new AI research institutes, administration officials told reporters in previewing the effort. In addition, the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to issue guidance in the next few months on how federal agencies can use AI tools. There will also be an independent commitment by top AI developers to participate in a public evaluation of their systems in August at the Las Vegas hacker convention DEF CON. Harris and administration officials on Thursday plan to discuss the risks they see in current AI development with the CEOs of Alphabet, Anthropic, Microsoft and OpenAI. The government leaders’ message to the companies is that they have a role to play in reducing the risks and that they can work together with the government. Authorities in the United Kingdom also are looking at the risks associated with AI. Britain’s competition watchdog said it’s opening a review of the AI market, focusing on the technology underpinning chatbots like ChatGPT, which was developed by OpenAI. President Joe Biden noted last month that AI can help to address disease and climate change but also could harm national security and disrupt the economy in destabilizing ways. The release of the ChatGPT chatbot this year has led to increased debate about AI and the government’s role with the technology. Because AI can generate human-like writing and fake images, there are ethical and societal concerns. OpenAI has been secretive about the data its AI systems have been trained upon. That makes it hard for those outside the company to understand why its ChatGPT is producing biased or false answers to requests or to address concerns about whether it’s stealing from copyrighted works. Companies worried about being liable for something in their training data might also not have incentives to properly track it, said Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at AI startup Hugging Face. “I think it might not be possible for OpenAI to actually detail all of its training data at a level of detail that would be really useful in terms of some of the concerns around consent and privacy and licensing,” Mitchell said in an interview Tuesday. “From what I know of tech culture, that just isn’t done.” Theoretically, at least, some kind of disclosure law could force AI providers to open up their systems to more third-party scrutiny. But with AI systems being built atop previous models, it won’t be easy for companies to provide greater transparency after the fact. “I think it’s really going to be up to the governments to decide whether this means that you have to trash all the work you’ve done or not,” Mitchell said. “Of course, I kind of imagine that at least in the U.S., the decisions will lean towards the corporations and be supportive of the fact that it’s already been done. It would have such massive ramifications if all these companies had to essentially trash all of this work and start over.” "
"Hollywood screenwriters don’t want robots taking their jobs, either",Daniel Arkin,"May 2, 2023, 10:49 PM UTC / Updated May 4, 2023, 6:52 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Hollywood screenwriters have long imagined dystopias where machines ruled over humans of the future. They are now starting to worry the machines are coming for them much sooner. The thousands of unionized scribes who went on strike this week are demanding better pay and taking aim at other issues, including the rise of generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, the AI-powered “chatbot” that has captivated and alarmed people in creative professions in recent months. The Writers Guild of America said it wants Hollywood’s top studios and networks to regulate the use of AI on creative projects. The union's specific demand, according to a document released Monday, states: “AI can’t write or rewrite literary material; can’t be used as source material; and MBA-covered [contract-covered] material can’t be used to train AI.” "
"Black Tech Twitter, trans users and more marginalized groups flock to Bluesky",Daysia Tolentino,"May 4, 2023, 3:36 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Many of the Black, queer and transgender users who made Twitter a cultural touchstone are growing weary of the platform, which they say has become increasingly inhospitable to marginalized communities. They are instead flocking to Bluesky, a buzzy invite-only app that may be the alternative jaded Twitter users have been looking for. Bluesky is in beta testing, meaning it’s not widely available yet; the company said it has about 50,000 users. The invitation system has reduced the risk of bad actors by limiting sign-ups and prioritizing people who bring in “trustworthy participants.” Some members of marginalized communities who are on it say they are cautiously optimistic that their early input will help create a tolerant environment as the app grows. Black tech workers on Twitter were one of the first communities to migrate to Bluesky, an initiative spearheaded by an active user named Aveta. “I just felt sad that many of my favorite people on Twitter were leaving and I didn’t get to interact with them and it just felt like a shell,” said Aveta, who asked to use her screen name to protect her privacy. “So I was, like, maybe by bringing them over to Bluesky, I can see them again.” Aveta joined the platform on April 15. She said she was encouraged by how familiar it felt and the team’s support for community builders. She secured some invitation codes and set out to bring in as many people as possible. Her first objective was to get her community, Black tech Twitter, onto Bluesky. “One thing that has remained consistent throughout all those years of social media was, at the core of the social media, Black people made it popular,” she said. She added: “We have such a huge impact on these networks, yet we are so often overlooked.” Once Black Twitter users started moving to Bluesky, Aveta said, others wanted to follow. “Black Twitter” — an unofficial group of users self-organized around shared cultural experiences that convenes sometimes viral discussions of social issues to pop culture — has played a key role in movements such as #SayHerName and #OscarsSoWhite. In 2018, Black Americans accounted for an estimated 28% of Twitter users, roughly double the proportion of the U.S. Black population, according to the media measurement company Nielsen. As of last spring, Black Americans were 5% more likely than the general population to have used Twitter in the last 30 days — second only to Asian American users, it said. Some signs indicate a slowdown among Black Twitter users that predates Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter last year. In April 2022, the rate of growth among Black Twitter users was already slower than among any other ethnic group: 0.8% in 2021, down from 2.5% the previous year, according to estimates provided by Insider Intelligence eMarketer. Aveta said she prioritized moving the Black tech community to Bluesky first to combine social appeal with technical knowledge. “I really wanted us in because, alongside the dev team, we can help shape and mold it. We can help give a perspective that may have not been considered before,” she said. The research firm Data.ai said that despite its invitation-only mode, Bluesky has ranked highly in download charts around the globe. Aveta has instructed those who want her Bluesky invitations to have someone who can vouch for their characters, because she has built her Bluesky community with intention. “The internet has good people, but it has very, very nasty people, and for me, when I’m inviting people and when I’m in that community-building mode, I will do everything in my power to make sure I keep them out,” she said. Aveta has dubbed herself the “unofficial sky mama” because of the number of invitations she has doled out to new users. She estimates that she has given out nearly 1,000, but she has lost track of the exact number. After she brought her community in, Aveta extended her invitations to people of color, queer people and disabled people. “Intersectionality matters to me,” she said. Among those she invited were several members of Tech by Choice, a 1,200-member nonprofit group that helps marginalized communities enter and stay in the tech industry. Valerie Phoenix, 29, who founded and runs the organization, said: “Through her, I was able to get people from the Tech by Choice community onto the platform so that they can understand what’s going on and learn how to build for the platform, which I think is huge — to have developers of color that are underrepresented trying to build for a new platform.” Phoenix, who goes by @DigitalBlkHippy on Twitter, said that Twitter has become more of an obligatory part of her social media presence — announcements and professional interactions, for example — since Musk took over and that she finds herself engaging more with community on Bluesky. The hands-on moderation on Bluesky makes her feel safe, she said, and she’s encouraged by the feedback the Bluesky team solicits. “It seems to be the opposite direction when it comes to moderation on Twitter,” she said. Queer and trans users have also taken to Bluesky, quickly becoming a sizable part of it. Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic and a trans rights activist, said one of the best parts about Bluesky, compared to Twitter, is that she can post normally without immediately getting an influx of transphobic remarks or death threats. “It was really nice to post stuff in a place that was so queer- and trans-friendly,” Caraballo said. “Also, it was very sex worker-positive, and it just overall had very good vibes. It was just refreshing, and it reminded me what social media actually could be.” Caraballo said Bluesky’s unique corporate structure as a public benefit limited liability company may have an impact on the app’s culture moving forward. A public benefit LLC allows executives to pursue social causes without prioritizing shareholder returns. “What that does is allow a company to have more leeway to protect its users without necessarily having to have a business rationale behind its policies,” she said. Pariss Chandler, the organizer of Black Tech Twitter and the founder of the recruitment platform Black Tech Pipeline, said diversity, equity and inclusion should be considered early in a platform’s launch. The prominence of marginalized communities in Bluesky’s beta testing is valuable for the developers who are building the app, she said. “They are really lucky to have all of these different communities on there, especially marginalized communities, because they’re getting feedback immediately,” Chandler said. “It’s like you’re getting different feedback from different experiences, different wants and needs and features people would like to see on the platform and why those things are important, especially when it comes to safety and moderation.” They are really lucky to have all of these different communities on there, especially marginalized communities, because they’re getting feedback immediately."" — Pariss Chandler, organizer of Black Tech Twitter Chandler said the developers’ quick responses to feedback or issues are a “beta experience,” because the platform isn’t widely available. However, once Bluesky becomes accessible to everyone, she said, moderation will be harder to address. Caraballo agreed that scaling up Bluesky’s moderation will be a challenge but said the actions of its current user base may dictate user expectations moving forward. “The most effective moderation is going to be community and social norms, like what is and isn’t OK to do,” she said. “And by establishing early that harassment and anti-social behavior is not really going to be tolerated, it can really kind of build up a specific type of community.” Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at eMarketer Insider Intelligence, said the challenge will be to maintain the same sense of comfort for users as Bluesky scales up. Although the app has many similarities to Twitter, its key difference is that it is decentralized. That means user data can be stored on independent servers rather than on one owned by the company. In the future, users will be able to develop their own servers to use with communities of their choosing. For now, most users interact on one main feed. As the servers splinter, it could result in communities that have more autonomy to punt trolls — or a more complicated, and less attractive, interface for potential new users. “It’s easier right now because it’s smaller, right?” she said. “But overall, it is the closest thing we have to a near-perfect replica of Twitter and, right now, without many of the challenges.” Bluesky didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In its moderation plans on its website, it says that as it grows, it will use “automated filtering, manual admin actions and community labeling” to moderate content. "
Ransomware attack affects Dallas police and court websites,Associated Press,"May 4, 2023, 1:58 PM UTC",Security,"Dallas was hit with a computer ransomware attack Wednesday that brought down its Police Department and City Hall websites and caused some jury trials to be canceled, officials said. The outage didn’t appear to affect 911 calls. However, it did cause problems with a computer-assisted dispatch system that is used to help firefighters respond to emergency calls, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans told the Dallas Morning News. “DFR has been running on manual dispatch operations since early this morning,” Evans said. Ransomware involves hackers essentially holding a target computer or computer system hostage by encrypting its files and demanding payment, often via bitcoin. Ransomware can target individuals, businesses and governments alike. In a statement, the city said the attack had only a limited impact on delivery of city services. “The City team, along with its vendors, are actively working to isolate the ransomware to prevent its spread, to remove the ransomware from infected servers, and to restore any services currently impacted,” read the statement. The city didn’t indicate whether any financial demands had actually been made or provide other details of the incident. The Police Department and City Hall websites were down Wednesday afternoon, officials said, and the Municipal Court posted a notice on its website that all jury trials and duties were canceled for the day.

Judge dismisses Trump’s lawsuit against The New York Times,Zoë Richards,"May 4, 2023, 2:15 AM UTC",Donald Trump,"A New York judge dismissed Donald Trump's 2021 lawsuit against The New York Times on Wednesday and ordered the former president to pay attorneys’ fees for the paper and three of its journalists who are listed as defendants. In his ruling Wednesday, Justice Robert R. Reed of the state Supreme Court in New York County said Trump's claims against the Times and three of its journalists for their Pulitzer-winning series on his undisclosed finances in 2018 ""fail as a matter of constitutional law."" (Supreme Court is the name of New York's top trial court.) ""Courts have long recognized that reporters are entitled to engage in legal and ordinary newsgathering activities without fear of tort liability — as these actions are at the very core of protected First Amendment activity,” Reed wrote. Reed, a Democrat, also ordered that Trump pay the paper and its journalists’ attorneys’ fees, legal expenses and costs. Reed's ruling comes as a defeat for Trump, who filed the $100 million lawsuit in 2021 against the Times, his estranged niece Mary Trump and others. The lawsuit alleged Mary Trump and three journalists from the paper — Susanne Craig, David Barstow and Russell Buettner — “engaged in an insidious plot to obtain confidential and highly-sensitive records which they exploited for their own benefit and utilized as a means of falsely legitimizing their publicized works.” Trump’s lawyers argued that the Times had played a role in “tortious interference” with a contract, knowingly breaching his contractual rights with his niece from a 2001 settlement agreement that bound her to confidentiality and nondisclosure of certain records. Citing precedent in New York courts, Reed dismissed the tortious interference claim “because The Times defendants’ purpose in reporting on a newsworthy story constitutes justification as a matter of law."" He further argued that the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of the press to report on newsworthy subjects guards against such claims. The Times welcomed the decision. ""The New York Times is pleased with the judge’s decision today. It is an important precedent reaffirming that the press is protected when it engages in routine newsgathering to obtain information of vital importance to the public,"" Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesperson, said in a statement. While Wednesday’s ruling dismisses the claims against the Times and its journalists, a ruling has not yet been rendered about Mary Trump, who has also filed a motion to dismiss. A spokesperson and a lawyer for Donald Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening. Neither did a lawyer for Mary Trump. Trump’s lawsuit is just one example of his legal battles over the disclosure of his finances. While Trump tried for years to keep his tax records from public view, breaking in precedent from many of his predecessors and engaging in a lengthy court fight to keep them private, the House Ways and Means Committee finally obtained and voted to publicly release them last year.

Hackers hijacked a university's emergency system to threaten students and faculty,Kevin Collier,"May 3, 2023, 6:06 PM UTC",Security,"Hackers hijacked a Virginia university’s emergency alerts system this week and, in what appears to be a first, used it to issue threats to students and faculty: The university must pay up or their files would be leaked online. In a series of messages sent over Bluefield University’s RamAlert, which sends text messages and emails to students and faculty when there’s a school emergency, hackers pushed university members to put pressure on the school’s president. “We have admissions data from thousands of students. Your personal information is at risk to be leaked on the darkweb blog,” the alerts said. “if we don’t receive payment, full data leak will be published!!!!!!!!” the message added. Bluefield University, a small, private university on the border of Virginia and West Virginia, is among the long and growing list of U.S. institutions hit by ransomware hackers, who break into computer systems to then encrypt or threaten to leak files if they are not paid. The school learned of the cyberattack on their systems on Sunday, a Bluefield University spokesperson told NBC News. On Monday, RamAlert sent out the hackers’ screed, telling students that their information would be published if the school didn’t pay a ransom. The messages from the hackers showed up on Bluefield students’ and teachers’ phones and in their emails, saying they had stolen school files and instructing them to pressure the university’s president to pay the hackers.

FTC calls for 'blanket' ban on Meta monetizing data of users under 18,Brian Cheung,"May 3, 2023, 5:20 PM UTC",Tech News,"The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday proposed a series of restrictions on Meta after an independent assessor found ""several gaps and weaknesses in Facebook's privacy program."" The restrictions would ban Meta, which owns Facebook, from profiting off the data collected from users who are under 18 years old. It is the third time the agency has taken action against the company for allegedly violating users’ privacy. “Facebook has repeatedly violated its privacy promises,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures.” The FTC’s move extends concerns over how the social media giant courts children. Instagram, another Meta company, had been developing a version for kids under 13 until public scrutiny pushed the company to table the project in late 2021. The FTC proposal also seeks to stop the company from releasing new products without approval from the independent privacy assessor and to put limits on the company’s use of facial recognition technology. A spokesperson for Meta said the move was ""a political stunt"" and that the company had been given no opportunity to respond to the allegations. “Let’s be clear about what the FTC is trying to do: usurp the authority of Congress to set industry-wide standards and instead single out one American company while allowing Chinese companies, like Tik Tok, to operate without constraint on American soil,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""FTC Chair Lina Khan’s insistence on using any measure — however baseless — to antagonize American business has reached a new low. We have spent vast resources building and implementing an industry-leading privacy program under the terms of our FTC agreement. We will vigorously fight this action and expect to prevail,"" the spokesperson added. The FTC settled with Facebook in 2019 over broader privacy concerns, with the company paying a $5 billion penalty. In 2020, Facebook agreed to a privacy program that included an independent assessor that would submit privacy reports about the company's products. The FTC said Wednesday that the assessor ""identified several gaps and weaknesses in Facebook’s privacy program,"" which the FTC found to ""pose substantial risks to the public."" Among those gaps was an issue with the security controls in the Messenger Kids product, which the FTC said had allowed children in some instances to communicate with unapproved contacts in group text chats and group video calls. A flaw identified in 2019 allowed thousands of strangers to enter group chats, The Verge originally reported. The FTC also said the assessor found that the company had continued to give app developers access to users' private information — sometimes as late as mid-2020 — despite promises to cut off such access. Meta has 30 days to respond to the findings. The FTC's proposal would modify the 2020 order, though FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya, said in a letter that he is unsure of the  commission's authority to modity the order to stop Facebook from monetizing the data of users under the age of 18.

Trump joins media coalition in opposing DA's proposal to limit public use of evidence in hush money case,Zoë Richards,"May 2, 2023, 11:24 PM UTC",Trump investigations,"Donald Trump has joined media organizations to argue against the Manhattan district attorney's effort to limit the public availability of evidence shared with the former president's attorneys in the lead-up to next year's hush money trial. A news coalition that includes NBC News sent a letter Monday arguing against a protective order proposed by District Attorney Alvin Bragg to restrict how evidence can be used before trial, including possibly sealing or redacting certain items. Trump signed on to the letter Tuesday, his attorneys said. Citing the letter, Trump’s lawyers said they also opposed “requiring the advance sealing or redaction of court filings or their exhibits in this case.” “We similarly oppose any Order which would require any Party to seek consent from the opposing party before filing any motion in unredacted form on the public docket,” Susan Necheles, Joe Tacopina and Todd Blanche wrote to New York state Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial. The decision to side with news organizations contrasts with Trump's frequent attacks on the media, which he called the “enemy of the people” when he was president. He has continued to deride journalists since he left office, particularly amid coverage of the trial stemming from hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. A lawyer and a spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday's letter. Trump's lawyers this week separately criticized Bragg's proposed protective order, which asks Merchan to block Trump from discussing some of the evidence publicly, including on social media. His attorneys characterized Bragg's request as an ""unprecedented and extraordinarily broad muzzle on a leading contender for the presidency of the United States"" and said it would violate his First Amendment rights. The Manhattan district attorney’s office declined to comment on Trump's opposition to the proposed order. In a filing last week, Assistant District Attorney Catherine McCaw asked Merchan to ensure that Trump views the evidence only in the presence of his lawyers. She argued that the order was necessary because the chance of Trump’s using evidence “inappropriately is substantial” because of his ""long history of discussing his legal matters publicly—including by targeting witnesses, jurors, investigators, prosecutors, and judges with harassing, embarrassing, and threatening statements on social media and in other public forums."" A court spokesperson said a hearing on the proposed order has been scheduled for Thursday morning. Trump pleaded not guilty last month after he was indicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made to Daniels and another woman during his 2016 presidential campaign. In a Fox News interview last month, Trump suggested the probe was an effort to hurt his 2024 presidential campaign. "
"Autopsy shows tech exec Bob Lee consumed alcohol, cocaine and ketamine before he was killed",David K. Li,"May 2, 2023, 7:08 PM UTC / Updated May 2, 2023, 9:54 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Bob Lee, the Cash App founder stabbed to death in San Francisco last month, ingested alcohol, cocaine and ketamine before he was killed, an autopsy report revealed Monday. Lee, 43, also had a compound that forms when alcohol and cocaine mix, called cocaethylene, in his system when he died, along with metabolized byproducts of cocaine and ketamine, according to findings from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The analysis listed the allergy medication cetirizine (best known by the brand name Zyrtec), as well. The report, by Dr. Ellen Moffatt, an assistant medical examiner, didn't make a link between those substances and Lee's cause of death, which was listed as multiple stab wounds. The manner and method of death, she concluded, was homicide by sharp injury. Lee suffered three stab wounds: two to the chest and one to a hip. One of the chest wounds was 2 to 3 inches deep, piercing the “right lateral anterior inferior ventricle of the heart” and the “right posterior lateral inferior ventricle,” the report said. But Paula Canny, the defense attorney for the suspect, Nima Momeni, emphasized Lee's drug use when she answered questions from reporters. ""There’s a lot of drugs in Bob Lee's system. I mean, Bob Lee's system is like the Walgreens of recreational drugs,"" Canny said after a pretrial hearing Tuesday outside the Hall of Justice in San Francisco. ""What happens when people take drugs? Generally, they act like drug people, and what drug people act like is not themselves, not happy-go-lucky,"" she added. ""Just kind of illusory and make bad decisions and do bad things."" On Tuesday, the arraignment and bail hearing for Momeni — who was arrested April 13 — was postponed to May 18. He faces murder charges. Lee was stabbed at about 2:30 a.m. April 4. Doctors worked for nearly four hours to try to save his life, but he was pronounced dead at the hospital at 6:49 a.m. The killing renewed debates over public safety in San Francisco, where Mayor London Breed has pledged to crack down on crime. “Violent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught, they are often released immediately,” Elon Musk tweeted in reply to a user who said Lee had been a friend. It turned out Momeni knew Lee. Momeni, 38, owns an information technology business and lives in the East Bay city of Emeryville. He and Lee allegedly got into an argument over Momeni's sister before the stabbing, according to court documents. At one point, his sister allegedly sent a text to Lee referring to the verbal confrontation. “Just wanted to make sure your doing ok Cause know nima came wayyyyyy down hard on you,” she wrote, according to the documents.

Dark web drug marketplace busted by Europol,Associated Press,"May 2, 2023, 4:50 PM UTC",Internet,"Law enforcement agencies around the world seized an online marketplace and arrested nearly 300 people allegedly involved in buying and selling drugs, European Union law enforcement agency Europol said Tuesday. The worldwide operation targeting the “Monopoly Market,” coordinated by Europol, is the latest major takedown of sales platforms for drugs and other illicit goods on the so-called dark web, a part of the internet hosted within an encrypted network and accessible only through specialized anonymity-providing tools. “Our coalition of law enforcement authorities across three continents proves that we all do better when we work together,” Europol’s Executive Director, Catherine De Bolle, said in a statement. “This operation sends a strong message to criminals on the dark web: International law enforcement has the means and the ability to identify and hold you accountable for your illegal activities, even on the dark web.” Europol said that 288 suspects were arrested and more than 50.8 million euros ($53.4 million) in cash and virtual currencies, 850 kilograms of drugs and 117 firearms were seized in a series of raids in several countries. In the Netherlands, where authorities arrested 10 suspects, police said the operation was made up of “separate but complementary actions that took place in nine countries over the past 18 months.” The Dutch national police’s Cyber ​​Enabled Crime Team was involved in the operation, codenamed SpecTor. “The intelligence that Europol shared with us, such as transaction data and virtual currency addresses, helped us to start new investigations and to enrich existing investigations. In this way we have identified and apprehended a number of important Dutch sellers,” said the Dutch team’s leader, Nan van de Coevering. “The success of this operation again shows that international cooperation is essential in combating crime on the dark web.” The seized drugs include over 569 pounds of amphetamines, 95 pounds of cocaine, 95 pounds of MDMA and over 22 pounds of LSD and ecstasy pills, the agency said. The most arrests — 153 — were made in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom with 55 and Germany with 52, Europol said. “A number of investigations to identify additional individuals behind dark web accounts are still ongoing,” Europol said. “As law enforcement authorities gained access to the vendors’ extensive buyer lists, thousands of customers across the globe are now at risk of prosecution as well.” The agency, based in The Hague, built intelligence based on evidence from Germany, which it said seized the marketplace’s “criminal infrastructure” in December 2021. Leading up to the operation announced Tuesday, German and U.S. authorities took down the “Hydra” dark web market in April last year. "
Samsung bans use of AI-like ChatGPT for employees after misuse of the chatbot,"Arjun Kharpal, CNBC","May 2, 2023, 1:28 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Samsung is restricting the use of so-called generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT for employees after the company discovered such services were being misused. The South Korean technology giant confirmed to CNBC Tuesday that it is temporarily restricting the use of generative AI through the company’s personal computers. Employees of one of Samsung’s biggest divisions were informed of the move in a memo at the end of April after there had been cases of misuse of the technology. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that some staff had uploaded sensitive code to ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a viral AI chatbot that is trained on huge amounts of data and is able to generate response to user queries. It is a form of so-called generative AI. Samsung does not have its own generative AI product yet. ChatGPT is developed by U.S. firm OpenAI which is backed by Microsoft while other generative AI products include Google’s Bard. Inputting sensitive company data into these foreign-owned services could be a concern to companies worried about leaks of crucial information. Samsung told employees to take precautions when using ChatGPT and other products outside of work and advised workers not to enter any personal or company related information into the services. In a Samsung company-wide survey conducted last month, 65% of those who responded said there was concern about security risks when using generative AI services. Samsung is not the only company restricting use of the technology. U.S. investment bank JPMorgan reportedly restricted use of ChatGPT among staff earlier this year. And Amazon this year reportedly warned employees not to upload confidential information, including code, to ChatGPT. Companies are assessing ways in which generative AI capabilities could be used within their business. ChatGPT can help engineers to generate computer code for example, to speed up their tasks. Software developers at Goldman Sachs have been using generative AI to help generate code. Despite the latest restrictions, Samsung is looking for ways in which generative AI could be used safely to enhance employee productivity and efficiency. "
Some Twitter users say they've been locked out of their accounts,David Ingram,"May 1, 2023, 10:25 PM UTC",Social Media,"Some Twitter users said Monday they were unable to log in to their accounts via web browsers, the latest complaint of a technical problem since CEO Elon Musk cut many of the service’s employees. A spike in reported problems began about 3 p.m. ET and lasted about three hours, according to Downdetector, a company that monitors complaints about online services. Other ways to access Twitter, such as apps on mobile phones, appeared not to be affected. The phrase “Desktop Twitter” was among the top trending topics on Twitter in the U.S. as people found other ways to post and express frustration with the service. Some people posted screenshots of Twitter asking them to create new accounts to get back on. The cause of the outage was not immediately clear. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaints, and Musk had not tweeted about them as of 6 p.m. ET. The reports echoed an episode in early February, when some people said they got error messages when they tried to post on Twitter. Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion six months ago, has laid off the majority of its employees as he tries to contain costs and pay down debt. Some former employees have said the cuts are taking a toll on Twitter's reliability, which depends on a complex network of large-scale computer servers and algorithms. "
Artificial intelligence pioneer leaves Google and warns about technology's future,Brahmjot Kaur,"May 1, 2023, 4:46 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"The ""godfather of AI"" is issuing a warning about the technology he helped create. Geoffrey Hinton, a trailblazer in artificial intelligence, has joined the growing list of experts sharing their concerns about the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. The renowned computer scientist recently left his job at Google to speak openly about his worries about the technology and where he sees it going. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” Hinton said in an interview with The New York Times. Hinton is worried that future versions of the technology pose a real threat to humanity. “The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” he said in the interview. “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.” Hinton, 75, is most noted for the rapid development of deep learning, which uses mathematical structures called neural networks to pull patterns from massive sets of data. Like other experts, he believes the race between Big Tech to develop more powerful AI will only escalate into a global race. Hinton tweeted Monday morning that he felt Google had acted responsibly in its development of AI, but that he had to leave the company to speak out. Jeff Dean, senior vice president of Google Research and AI, said in an emailed statement: “Geoff has made foundational breakthroughs in AI, and we appreciate his decade of contributions at Google. I’ve deeply enjoyed our many conversations over the years. I’ll miss him, and I wish him well! As one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We’re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.” Hinton is a notable addition to a group of technologists that have been speaking out publicly about the unbridled development and release of AI. Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin, the co-founders of the Center for Humane Technology, spoke with “Nightly News” host Lester Holt in March about their own concerns around AI. “What we want is AI that enriches our lives. AI that works for people, that works for human benefit that is helping us cure cancer, that is helping us find climate solutions,” Harris said during the interview. “We can do that. We can have AI and research labs that’s applied to specific applications that does advance those areas. But when we’re in an arms race to deploy AI to every human being on the planet as fast as possible with as little testing as possible, that’s not an equation that’s going to end well.” An open letter from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, which was signed by 19 current and former leaders of academic society, was released last month warning the public of the risks around AI and the need for collaboration to mitigate some of those concerns. “We believe that AI will be increasingly game-changing in healthcare, climate, education, engineering, and many other fields,” the letter said. “At the same time, we are aware of the limitations and concerns about AI advances, including the potential for AI systems to make errors, to provide biased recommendations, to threaten our privacy, to empower bad actors with new tools, and to have an impact on jobs.” Hinton, along with scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, won the Turing Award in 2019, known as the tech industry’s version of the Nobel Prize, for their advancements in AI. Hinton, Bengio and LeCun were open about their concerns with AI but were optimistic about the potential of the technology, including detecting health risks earlier than doctors and more accurate weather warnings about earthquakes and floods. “One thing is very clear, the techniques that we developed can be used for an enormous amount of good affecting hundreds of millions of people,” Hinton previously told The Associated Press.

Backlash against AI supermodels triggers wider fears in fashion workforce,Sara Ruberg,"April 30, 2023, 2:00 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Plans by Levi’s to test out virtual clothing models generated by artificial intelligence drew swift backlash in the industry late last month. While the furor mainly focused on diversity concerns, the retailer’s proposal also stirred up other anxieties that have been simmering in the industry for years. Some critics of Levi Strauss & Co.’s partnership with AI design firm Lalaland.ai, which aimed to show online shoppers different types of people wearing Levi’s garments, accused the retailer of looking to inexpensively address issues of representation — potentially pushing professional models out of their jobs in the process. “When you have to hire a model, book an agency, have a stylist, do the makeup, feed them on set — all that costs money,” said Shawn Grain Carter, a professor of fashion business management at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. “Let’s make no mistake about it, Levi’s is doing this because this saves them money.” A Levi’s spokesperson referred to a statement in which the company denied any intentions to save costs with the project. The retailer said that the AI models it planned to introduce would supplement but not replace its photoshoots with live models. Lalaland didn’t respond to a request for comment. Worries about technology displacing human labor are nothing new, and they’re far from distinct to the fashion workforce. But while AI has been used in fashion for years, some workers are watching its expansion in the space with growing alarm. Yanii Gough, a model and the founder of Yanii Models, where she works with over 100 models, said that many are still “dying to get back to consistency” as the industry re-emerges from pandemic-related disruptions. With the rise of AI modeling firms, clients can simply “send an email to the agency and say, ‘Hey, this is exactly what I’m looking for,’ and someone will find that person,” she said, referring to companies that book models for everything from photoshoots to fittings. There is some precedent for concerns like Gough’s. Shudu, created in 2017 and thought to be the world’s first digital supermodel, has booked gigs within the past year with high-end brands such as BMW and Louis Vuitton. Shudu, who was designed as a Black woman, also drew criticism toward The Diigitals, the AI modeling agency that created her, and its founder, Cameron-James Wilson, who is white. Today, options continue to expand for brands and advertisers looking to use AI to help market and sell clothes. In addition to Lalaland, there’s also Deep Agency, a new AI startup that allows users to create a virtual photoshoot with either synthetic models or an AI version of a real person. Gough said she also worries about models’ images being used without their permission via AI, a concern that Sara Ziff, the founder of a nonprofit advocacy group called the Model Alliance, said she is hearing as well. “Fit models may be replaced by AI body scans,” she said, adding that these models — who try on clothes for designers and manufacturers to check sizing and silhouettes — are already calling her organization in growing numbers. Ziff said some have complained that companies are hiring them to conduct body scans, which can form the basis for product development without their knowledge or receiving compensation. “So they’re able to design the clothes on virtually using a scan of the model’s body, rather than actually having to book the model in person,” said Ziff, who declined to provide examples, citing the Model Alliance’s policy of maintaining an anonymous hotline for industry workers to flag complaints. Fashion brands have defended their AI efforts as add-ons that benefit shoppers, and the AI design studios and agencies working in the space similarly describe their efforts as supplemental. Lalaland’s founders, for example, have said they created the company to sustainably increase representation in fashion. Agents and management companies who book models for the types of jobs Ziff described don’t legally have to tell them their body scans could be used on more projects without compensation, she said. Ziff is advocating for the proposed Fashion Workers Act in New York, which she said would force agencies to more fully disclose the scope of work and pay. Current law leaves some gray area around models’ rights to organize unions, Ziff added, resulting in limited labor protections. Because most models are considered independent contractors, many face heightened risks of being sued or retaliated against by their agencies. Representatives for other professionals in creative fields, like the Writers Guild of America, have the power to propose standards and best practices for AI use in their industries. Meanwhile, AI models have become so realistic that it’s already impossible for many consumers to distinguish them from images of humans. Ashley France, an influencer who criticized Levi’s partnership with Lalaland, said she hopes regulators will step in. “The same way that we have to put a PSA that something’s an ad, or that something’s a dietary supplement — or now, thankfully, that something is photoshopped — I feel like it should be the same type of regulations,” France said.

"What to know about Bluesky, the Twitter alternative that some celebrities and journalists are joining",Kalhan Rosenblatt,"April 28, 2023, 10:07 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Bluesky is the internet's buzziest social media platform — but you need an invite to get a look at it. The decentralized Twitter clone is in beta, and invites are scarce. Twitter is full of people asking others for Bluesky access codes to avoid being put on a waitlist. It's become the latest platform to be described as a potential Twitter replacement for some following Elon Musk’s takeover of the social media app. While Bluesky's beta was made public in February, buzz surrounding the platform grew in April as more Twitter users began posting about flocking there. As of Friday, politicians such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen had joined the platform. Here's what to know about the platform some are describing as the next Twitter. The idea for Bluesky originated at Twitter in 2019, but it became its own public benefit company in 2022 — with backing from former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter in 2006 and stepped down as chief executive in 2021, now serves on the board for Bluesky. The platform clarified its relationship to Twitter in a lengthy thread in April 2022, where it noted that former Twitter software engineer Jay Graber was also brought on to help launch the new platform. Although the Bluesky app has many similarities to Twitter, its key difference is that it is organized around a decentralized system. That means user data can be stored on independent servers rather than ones owned by the company, and that in the future, users will be able to develop their own servers that they can use with communities of their choosing. “People have been saying for years that it would be great if users could own their data and their relationships; if we could have transparent algorithms and algorithmic choice; if there could be more accountability and user control over how social platforms are moderated,” Graber wrote in a blog post last month. “​​We’ve now designed and built a system that we think achieves the goals stated above.” The platform allows users to post text and images to a central feed, follow other users, and repost (similar to a retweet). The look and feel is nearly identical to Twitter, and people’s feeds are already filled with memes and jokes. Users do not have the ability to direct message each other or block others — at least not yet. Posts, or “skeets” as some have taken to calling them on Bluesky, are limited to 300 characters. There are currently no video capabilities, but users can post images. At the moment, the best way to get on Bluesky is to beg. Bluesky began letting people off its waitlist this year and has been rolling out invites in waves. The difficulty getting onto the platform has led to a host of half-joking memes from those hoping to snag an invite code. One person even claimed to sell Bluesky invite codes for more than $190 on eBay. Bluesky has yet to announce a date for widespread public release. In her March blog post, Graber wrote that the platform is working to ""finish pieces that we believe to be critical,"" such as its content moderation system. The Bluesky app racked up 375,000 downloads on iOS worldwide as of Wednesday, according to analytics firm Data.ai. The app was recently released on Android, but data for Android downloads hadn’t been collected as of Friday. The site is predominantly populated by journalists, internet personalities, tech experts and some celebrities. Ocasio-Cortez and Teigen appear to be the most high-profile names on the platform so far. Jordan Uhl, a progressive activist with more than 271,000 followers on Twitter, joined Bluesky on April 14. He said the app feels like it has the potential to be the first true alternative to Twitter. “There’s just been this huge influx of people who are fed up with the way Twitter is going and haven’t found a viable alternative, and it seems like this is what they think could be the next Twitter,” he said. However, there is still no verification process on Bluesky, which means impersonators have already begun cropping up. As of Friday, troll accounts impersonating author J.K. Rowling and Twitter owner Elon Musk have appeared on the platform. Since Musk acquired Twitter, the social media platform has been plagued with glitches, bugs and sweeping changes. Most recently, Twitter removed legacy verification, prompting more departures. And as Twitter becomes more chaotic, users have sought a new  platform. Last year, many said they were opting to join sites like Mastodon, a decentralized microblogging platform; Post.news; Substack Notes; and other Twitter alternatives. But some, like Mastodon, have been deemed too complicated to navigate because of the server-based nature. Bluesky's currently exclusive nature has also proved to be in its favor. On Sunday, the platform became a trending term on Twitter. With a limited amount of people on the platform, Bluesky has seemingly yet to be infiltrated by conspiracy theorists. That may change in the future. Bluesky will potentially open up the app once it has a more robust moderation system in place, Graber wrote in her blog. ""We want to enable people to have a safe, enjoyable experience, so we’re regulating growth and building moderation tooling as a first-order feature and not as an afterthought,"" she said. "
Lesbian dating platform sends a 'message to transphobes': Delete our app,Jay Valle,"April 28, 2023, 10:00 PM UTC",OUT News,"A popular lesbian dating app has one message for users who don’t want transgender people on the platform: “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.” HER, a global dating and network platform for lesbians and other queer people looking for love and friendship, sent a mass notification to its users on Wednesday: “A Message for Transphobes: Time to delete HER,” it said, in part. “We have a very big thriving lesbian community on HER, and so we want to make that message really clear,” Robyn Exton, who founded the platform in 2015, told NBC News on Friday. “All lesbians are welcome and celebrated on HER — trans lesbians, nonbinary lesbians.” Exton, who said the app has 20 million users globally, 12.5% of which identify as transgender or nonbinary, said she and her colleagues at HER are determined to push back against the narrative that lesbian identity is “owned by cis[gender] lesbians,” meaning lesbians who do not identify as transgender. “We are cis women, and we just fundamentally do not agree with that,” she said. In honor of Lesbian Visibility Day on Wednesday, the HER team published a blog post titled: “This Lesbian Visibility Day, We Are Reclaiming ‘Lesbian.’” The post, which was written by Exton, expresses support for trans and nonbinary lesbians and pushes back against those who don’t. “There’s no such thing as a ‘real lesbian.’ But being a genuinely lousy human? Oh, that’s a thing. Join us in honoring trans and non-binary lesbians today and forever,” the post said. Following the publication of the post, HER’s Twitter account received a tidal wave of backlash from those who disagreed with it. The HER Twitter account pushed back, and, shortly after the heated exchanges, Twitter temporarily suspended the HER account. Exton said the 24-hour suspension, which occurred on Lesbian Visibility Day, was “largely because of the interaction with the ‘TERF’ audience, who then just kept repeatedly reporting our account.” (TERF is an acronym for transgender-exclusionary radical feminist.) Twitter responded to a request for comment with the “Pile of Poo” emoji, which, as Elon Musk announced last month, is now the automated message sent to press requests. As NBC News reported last week, Twitter has quietly changed its hateful conduct policy, removing language that protected transgender people from online harassment. The advocacy group GLAAD condemned the move, calling it the latest in a series of changes that have made the platform less safe for people and advertisers. Exton said the HER app seeks to minimize transgender discrimination on the app by, among other things, suspending the accounts of those who publicly post preferences that exclude transgender users. “When you are explicitly stating that you will not consider a whole identity group, that tosses discriminatory behavior.” After the restoration of the HER Twitter account, Exton shared a video on the platform in celebration of Lesbian Visibility Week, saying HER wants to make it clear that “lesbians exist in all different kinds and types; there is no one way to be a lesbian.” "
"Cleopatra was not Black, Egypt tells Netflix in growing feud ahead of new series",Charlene Gubash,"April 28, 2023, 12:08 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"CAIRO — Egypt has accused Netflix of misrepresenting history by casting a Black woman to play Cleopatra, its most famous historical figure, in a new series. “Queen Cleopatra,” which is released May 10, features Adele James in the lead role, a casting decision that the streaming giant says is “a nod to the centuries-long conversation about the ruler’s race” but which officials in Cairo have dismissed as “blatant historical fallacy.” The government statement issued Thursday marked an escalation in a feud that has sparked demands for the show's cancellation, amid a broader debate over representation in popular culture. The eight-episode docudrama is executive produced by Jada Pinkett-Smith. But Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities argued that the documentary nature of the feature “requires those in charge of its production to investigate accuracy and rely on historical and scientific facts.” Coins and statues from the time show a light-skinned woman, in keeping with Cleopatra's Macedonian Greek ancestry, it argued. Dr. Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said in the statement that Cleopatra’s appearance in the show was a “falsification of Egyptian history and a blatant historical fallacy.” He added that his complaint was “far from any ethnic racism, stressing full respect for African civilizations and for our brothers in the African continent that brings us all together.” Representation of historical figures on screen has fueled heated debates across the world, but especially so in a country with such a rich history as Egypt, which has made its ancient past a huge part of its modern national identity and tourism industry. The famous queen, who was crowned Cleopatra VII and reigned from 51 to 30 BC as its last ruler, was the direct descendent of Ptolemy I Soter, bodyguard to Alexander the Great and founder of the Greek-speaking Ptolemaic Kingdom. After her much-discussed and dramatized death — according to popular legend due to a self-inflicted snake bite — Egypt became a Roman colony. Roman writers including Plutarch and Cassius Dio, known for chronicling the Roman and Greek worlds during Cleopatra’s reign, said Cleopatra was light-skinned and of Macedonian ancestry. Other scholars have argued it is possible she could have been one-quarter Egyptian. “Egyptians did not bear the features of sub-Saharan Africans,” said Dr. Samia Al-Mirghani, former director general of the Center for Research and Conservation of Antiquities, in a statement citing evidence from anthropological studies and DNA tests. Inscriptions on ancient tombs and statues, she argued, “portrayed the [ancient] Egyptians with features as close as possible to the contemporary Egyptians. She admitted however that there was “a great diversity” among Egyptians due to the kingdom’s fluid, international nature. One of Egypt’s most famous archaeologists and twice-serving antiquities minister, Zahi Hawass, was adamant: Cleopatra was not Black. “If we see statues and forms of her father and brother, we will not find any evidence supporting this claim that she was black,” he said in a statement. Hawass added that Egypt at the time of Cleopatra’s reign ruled over the Kingdom of the Kush, also known as Nubia, in what is now Sudan and southern Egypt, with its distinctive Black African culture. “But they have no connection with the Pharaonic civilization,” he said. The creators of a petition on change.org calling for the show to be  canceled said it had more than 100,000 signatures before it was taken offline without warning. NBC News has approached Change.org to ask if the petition was taken down and, if so, the reasons why. Both Netflix and Nutopia, the production company behind “Queen Cleopatra,” did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Egyptian lawmaker Saboura al-Sayyed this week repeated an earlier call for Netflix to be banned across the country. This is not the first time the casting of Cleopatra has sparked controversy. Israeli actor Gal Godot made headlines in 2020 when she was chosen to play the role in a forthcoming movie, leading to accusations of ""whitewashing."" Writing in Variety last week, the Netflix show’s director, Tina Gharani, wrote that as a child she watched Elizabeth Taylor’s Hollywood portrayal of Cleopatra, but had always wondered about the accuracy of the casting: “I was captivated, but even then, I felt the image was not right. Was her skin really that white?” She argues that while the queen was descended from Macedonian royalty, “Cleopatra was eight generations away from these Ptolemaic ancestors, making the chance of her being white somewhat unlikely.” Gharani wrote that the casting of a Black actor was a political act, one that has seen her become the target of an online hate campaign. “Why shouldn’t Cleopatra be a melanated sister? And why do some people need Cleopatra to be white? Her proximity to whiteness seems to give her value, and for some Egyptians it seems to really matter,” she said. James, the actress playing the iconic queen, fired back at critics in a recent Twitter post featuring screengrabs of abusive comments that included a racist slur. “If you don’t like the casting, don’t watch the show,” she said. Charlene Gubash reported from Cairo, and Patrick Smith from London. "
BBC chief quits amid scandal over role in Boris Johnson loan,Associated Press,"April 28, 2023, 9:54 AM UTC",World,"The chairman of the BBC quit Friday after a report found he failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest over his role in arranging a 2021 loan for Boris Johnson, who was the U.K.’s prime minister at the time. The publicly funded national broadcaster has been under political pressure after it was revealed that Richard Sharp helped arrange the line of credit weeks before he was appointed to the BBC post on the government’s recommendation. The 800,000 pound ($1 million) line of credit came from wealthy Canadian businessman Sam Blyth, who was introduced to Johnson by Sharp, a Conservative Party donor. Johnson was the party’s leader as well as British prime minister. Sharp said he was quitting to “prioritize the interests of the BBC” after making an “inadvertent” breach of the rules. “I feel that this matter may well be a distraction from the corporation’s good work were I to remain in post until the end of my term,” he said. Sharp said he would remain in his BBC role until the end of June while the search for a successor takes place. A report on the incident by senior lawyer Adam Heppinstall published Friday found Sharp “failed to disclose potential perceived conflicts of interest.” The investigation is the latest uncomfortable episode for the 100-year-old BBC, which is funded by a license fee paid by all households with a television and has a duty to be impartial in its news coverage. The public broadcaster is frequently a political football, with some members of the Conservative government seeing a leftist slant in its news output and some liberals accusing it of having a conservative bias. The BBC was engulfed in a storm over free speech and political bias in March when its leading sports presenter, former England soccer player Gary Lineker, criticized the government’s immigration policy on social media. Lineker was suspended — and then restored after other sports presenters, analysts and Premier League players boycotted the BBC airwaves in solidarity. "
James Corden addresses divided America in final ‘Late Late Show’,Associated Press,"April 28, 2023, 9:18 AM UTC",World,"James Corden used part of his farewell speech on Thursday’s final episode of CBS’ “ The Late Late Show” to address the deep rift in America over hot button issues including politics and ideology. “We started this show with Obama, then Trump and a global pandemic. I’ve watched America change a lot. I’ve watched divisions grow and I’ve felt a sense of negativity boil over,” said the host. He implored his audience to “remember what America signifies to the rest of the world. My entire life it has always been a place of optimism. ... Yes, it has flaws but show me a place that doesn’t. Show me a person that doesn’t. “Just because somebody disagrees with you it doesn’t make them bad or evil. We are all more the same than we are different. There are so many people who are trying to stoke those differences and we have to try as best we can to look for the light, look for the joy. If you do, it’s out there. That’s all this show has ever been about,” he said. Corden announced one year ago that he would be ending his late-night show after eight seasons, citing a desire to return to his native U.K. to be closer to family and loved ones. His parents were seated in the audience for the final taping, and his sisters, he joked, were in town too — but at a bar instead. Also Thursday CBS aired a primetime special called “The Last Last Late Late Show Special” featuring taped segments with Tom Cruise (where they performed stunts and sang a duet of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” from “The Lion King”) and Adele, where they taped a final Carpool Karaoke segment. Corden reminded the singer that she has an Emmy, Grammy and Oscar and wondered if she would ever actively pursue a Tony Award. “You have the EGO” he said. “I really don’t think that that is ever gonna happen. I would never write a musical or anything like that because I (expletive) hate musicals,” said Adele to laughter. “I also think the EGO suits me better.” Harry Styles and Will Ferrell were Corden’s final guests. Styles has been a frequent visitor to the show, and has even guest-hosted twice. He’s been game for a number of taped bits with Corden including the time the host directed a music video for Styles’ song “Daylight” for just $300 and when the musician took part in a more than 11-minute segment featuring a U.K. Vs. U.S. dodgeball game where Corden, Styles, “Games of Thrones” actor James Bradley and Benedict Cumberbatch faced off against players including Michelle Obama, Mila Kunis, Kate Hudson, Lena Waithe, and Melissa McCarthy. “As a friend, I’m so incredibly proud of you,” Styles told Corden. “On a personal note, you’ve been a safe space to me always as a friend.” He added that he was ’“selfishly very excited that you’re coming home.” Styles, Corden and Ferrell then embraced in a group hug. There were also goodbyes from the other late night hosts. Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert and David Letterman all appeared in a pre-taped segment with Corden. They joked that since Corden was ending his show, they could each call dibs on one of his segments. They all chose Carpool Karaoke, referencing Corden’s most popular sketch where he drives around Los Angeles with celebrities and sing songs. Paul McCartney, Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder and Chris Martin are a few of his Carpool Karaoke passengers. The segment was such a hit that it spun-off into its own series for Apple. Corden only appeared in the debut episode with Will Smith in the car. Corden closed out the night by playing a piano and singing a song with the crew and staff gathered around the stage. “Part of me thinks I should stay here forever but deep in my heart I just know,” Corden sang. “No more shows to be showing, it’s time I was going, It’s time. Thanks for watching, that’s our show.” "
Disney fans are fighting online in response to the company's lawsuit against DeSantis,Kat Tenbarge,"April 27, 2023, 10:03 PM UTC",Internet,"On Disney World vacation-planning blogs and forums, daily discussion usually revolves around ride wait times, crowd density and annual pass rates. But when Disney World sued Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday, conversation turned to the culture wars. One moderator of the Disney World subreddit wrote, “I’ve removed at least 40 comments from people being very rude/ hateful towards Desantis and more importantly his children and spouse.” A separate commenter responded to the lawsuit by writing, “Please boycott [Walt Disney World] from June 3rd to June 11th. Thank you in advance.” On Wednesday, the DeSantis-appointed Central Florida Tourism Oversight District board declared Disney’s development agreement for future park plans in Orlando “void” and “unenforceable.” That same day, Disney sued DeSantis and the board members, alleging a “targeted campaign of government retaliation” that violated the company’s protected speech. On Thursday, DeSantis brushed off the lawsuit as “political” during a press conference. After Disney opposed DeSantis’ controversial Parental Rights in Education Act, colloquially known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, DeSantis’ administration has repeatedly targeted Disney Parks and Disney’s flagship location in Orlando, calling the company “woke” and accusing Disney of “indoctrinating young children.” The rhetoric and accompanying threats — which include DeSantis suggesting measures like putting a “state prison” next to Disney World — have caused a stir in the formerly apolitical world of Disney tourism. The resulting conflict over Disney’s property and land-use rights has left Disney bloggers and moderators of the largest Walt Disney World fan forums in the tricky position of enforcing family-friendly, civility and “no politics” rules in their online communities. “People are free to say they disagree with policies and what’s happening, but once they use adjectives and personal attacks and things like that, especially name-calling, we have pretty strict rules as a Disney World subreddit,” one of the moderators for the largest Walt Disney World subreddit, with over 616,000 members, said in a phone interview. “We remove a whole lot of stuff to be safe, and we get pushback from the left and the right,” said the moderator, who asked that his name not be disclosed for his privacy. “We have folks saying, ‘You guys are obviously a bunch of liberal shills’ and then we have people saying, ‘You guys are fascist enablers.’” The lawsuit also follows DeSantis’ move to dissolve the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the special governing district that was formed so Disney could maintain its own city-within-a-city, complete with its own infrastructure, roads, fire department and water district. DeSantis signed the bill in April 2022 and it will take effect in June 2023. Travel and Disney Parks blogger Tom Bricker, who runs the Disney Tourist Blog, has been authoring blog updates as the political turmoil around DeSantis and Reedy Creek continues. Bricker’s writing is largely nonpolitical and he moderates the comments with a similar mentality. “For years, our comment policy was simply ‘no politics,’” Bricker wrote in an emailed statement. Things changed even before DeSantis turned against Disney, Bricker said, after the park shut down due to Covid-19 quarantine. Bricker and the Disney World subreddit moderator said that discussion about the theme park operations converged with political discourse, as vaccinations and the use of masks became politicized. As someone who covers both Disney World and Disneyland, which is located in Anaheim, California, Bricker said he could apply the same moderation principles to the different approaches the two state governors took. “Throughout that, we adopted a viewpoint-neutral attitude that encouraged readers to express their opinions and debate policies in a civil manner,” Bricker wrote. “Basically, ‘attack ideas, not people.’” In a recent blog post, Bricker criticized DeSantis’ tactics, calling them “political theater.” “These are not serious people with sincere motivations,” he wrote. While the Disney World subreddit moderator said this is the most political topic he’s seen discussed in Disney fandom, he said there have been other heated debates in the forum’s history, including when Disney banned smoking and vaping in 2019 and when it was rumored that Disney’s President Donald Trump audio-animatronic in the Hall of Presidents attraction was originally supposed to be Hillary Clinton. “I or another moderator will usually stick a comment at the top of the thread that says, ‘Hey, remember this is a Disney World site, let’s try to keep politics out of it,’” the moderator said. Bricker said his blog is “fortunate to have a following of thoughtful people who express themselves respectfully even when disagreeing.” Still, moderation isn’t easy. “It can be a tough needle to thread and unpleasant task, especially since the subject matter of Disney skews more toward fantasy and escapism — and all of this is decidedly not that,” Bricker wrote.

'Red Table Talk’ is canceled after Facebook Watch shows are shut down,Variety,"April 27, 2023, 5:29 PM UTC",NBCBLK,"Amid broad cost-cutting moves, Meta is shuttering the Facebook Watch originals group, whose small slate of shows included the breakout hit “Red Table Talk” hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith, Variety has confirmed. A Meta representative confirmed that the company is shuttering its Facebook Watch originals group but declined to provide further comment. The news was first reported by Deadline. None of the Facebook Watch originals will be returning for new seasons. Moving forward, Meta’s entertainment team is focused on creating virtual-reality experiences in Meta Horizon Worlds that can also be accessed across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. With the shutdown of Facebook Watch originals, Mina Lefevre, head of development and programing for the group, is leaving the company. Lefevre joined Meta (then called Facebook) in 2017, after serving as MTV’s head of scripted development. At Meta, Lefevre reported to Ricky Van Veen, VP of creative strategy. Lefevre’s exit comes as Meta is cutting 10,000 jobs across the company, coming after it laid off 11,000 staffers at the end of 2022. On Wednesday, Meta announced first-quarter 2023 earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, as its revenue grew 3% for the period after analysts had forecast a decline. Facebook Watch’s originals started out with a mix of scripted and unscripted shows, but the company shifted entirely to unscripted fare in recent years. Its current shows include “Red Table Talk” and Steve Harvey talk show “Steve on Watch,” a revival of his daytime show after it was dropped by NBC. Other Facebook Watch shows shepherded by Lefevre included docuseries-style shows from Gen Z star JoJo Siwa, Yara Shahidi and Becky G. “Red Table Talk” series is produced by Westbrook Studios, cofounded by Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith; the company is said to be looking for a new distributor now that the Facebook Watch deal is done. The Daytime Emmy-winning talk show featured Pinkett Smith, daughter Willow Smith and mother Adrienne “Gammy” Banfield-Norris. “Red Table Talk” has 11 million followers on Facebook and spawned an active Facebook discussion group with 600,000 members. Westbook also produced a spinoff, “Red Table Talk: The Estefans,” featuring Gloria Estefan, her daughter Emily and her niece Lili. For the Facebook Watch team, the strategy from the beginning was to produce video programming that tapped into “the social fabric of Facebook,” as Van Veen said in 2018 — i.e., generate communities of people talking about and sharing the episodes. Execs also hoped that the originals would encourage other content creators to adopt Facebook Watch. Meta’s shutdown of Facebook Watch originals comes after other tech companies have similarly retreated. Snapchat shuttered its originals group last summer as part of a broader cost-cutting move, while YouTube folded most of its original productions while maintaining a slate of kids’ content and programming from its Black Voices fund.

"Tucker Carlson re-emerges, targeting the U.S. media and political system",Reuters,"April 27, 2023, 8:34 AM UTC",U.S. news,"Former Fox News star Tucker Carlson surfaced publicly on Wednesday for the first time since abruptly leaving the network this week, releasing a videotaped statement in which he criticized the state of public discourse on U.S. television. Carlson did not directly address his departure from Fox, where he hosted the highest-rated cable news program in the key age demographic on the most-watched U.S. cable news network. Instead, he took aim at American media and the U.S. political system. “Both political parties and their donors have reached consensus on what benefits them and they actively collude to shut down any conversation about it,” Carlson said. “Suddenly the United States looks very much like a one-party state. That’s a depressing realization, but it's not permanent,” he said. “Where can you still find Americans saying true things?” Carlson asked. “There aren’t many places left, but there are some.” Despite signing off the roughly two-minute clip with the words “see you soon,” Carlson did not give any hints of his next move. Carlson and Fox parted ways less than a week after parent company Fox Corp. settled a defamation lawsuit for $787.5 million in which Carlson played a starring role. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a tipping point for Fox executives may have been private messages containing what the paper called “highly offensive and crude remarks” by Carlson. The Wall Street Journal reported that Carlson called a senior executive the “c-word.” Dominion Voting Systems said in its lawsuit that Carlson allowed debunked election-fraud claims about the voting-technology firm to air on his show, while casting doubts on the plausibility of those claims in some of the private messages. Carlson is also key to additional legal battles facing Fox, including a lawsuit filed by his former head of booking, Abby Grossberg, who said Fox coerced her testimony in the Dominion case. Grossberg last month accused network lawyers of pressuring her to provide misleading testimony and said Fox exposed her and others to rampant sexism and misogyny. Fox fired Grossberg, saying her legal claims were “riddled with false allegations against Fox and our employees.” "
Elon Musk meets with Sen. Schumer to discuss artificial intelligence,Zoë Richards,"April 27, 2023, 1:48 AM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Elon Musk visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for a discussion that focused on artificial intelligence. Democrats and Republicans are pushing for new regulations in the tech industry to address a growing array of issues, such as generative chatbots and concerns over deep fakes and voice phishing scams. Asked about the meeting, Musk said: “It was good. We talked about the future.” Pressed for specifics, he said they spoke about ""AI and the economy."" Schumer, D-N.Y., characterized it as a ""good meeting."" ""We talked about Buffalo. Tesla has a large plant in Buffalo. And we talked about AI,” Schumer told reporters. Schumer said this month that he had circulated a “framework” for rules to help the U.S. stay competitive with China on the regulatory front and put new restrictions on potentially harmful AI tools. In a statement at the time, Schumer said, “I look forward to working across the aisle, across the industry and across the country and beyond to shape this proposal and refine legislation to make sure AI delivers on its promise to create a better world.” It wasn't the first time Musk has met with lawmakers. In January, he tweeted about having met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. Schumer said Wednesday's meeting was the second time he’s met with Musk, the first being about 10 years ago when he visited him with then Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., at SpaceX. "
Montana governor wants to expand state TikTok ban to potentially include other social media platforms,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"April 26, 2023, 8:59 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"The governor of Montana has proposed changes to the language of a bill that seeks to ban TikTok in the state, according to documents obtained by NBC News. Gov. Greg Gianforte's proposed amendment, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, strikes out any mention of  TikTok or TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and instead stipulates the ban would be applied to ""social media applications that provide certain data to foreign adversaries."" ""A social media app may not operate within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana"" if that app allows personal data or information to be collected and ""provided to a foreign adversary or a person or entity located within a country designated as a foreign adversary,"" the proposed amendment reads. The amendment for consideration seeks to improve the bill by broadening Montanans’ privacy protections beyond just TikTok and against all foreign adversaries, while also addressing the bill’s technical and legal concerns. -Kaitlin Price, the governor's press secretary Some in the field of technology and free speech said they have concerns about the drafted amendment, including the lack of definitions of ""data collection"" and ""social media application."" Two experts who spoke to NBC News said the amendment only worsens an already problematic bill. A spokesperson for Gianforte said the changes are intended to strengthen the bill. “The amendment for consideration seeks to improve the bill by broadening Montanans’ privacy protections beyond just TikTok and against all foreign adversaries, while also addressing the bill’s technical and legal concerns,"" said Kaitlin Price, the governor's press secretary. The original bill, which lawmakers passed on April 14, was expected to face legal challenges. Ari Cohn, a free speech counsel at TechFreedom, described the amendment as “deeply stupid and an exercise in completely missing the point.” Cohn suggested the amendment could exacerbate the bill’s legal woes. The issue wasn't that the bill singled out TikTok, but rather that “the Montana Legislature was attempting to cut users off from an entire forum for expression, purportedly over national security concerns that were vague and generalized,"" Cohn said. TikTok has come under fire by critics who say the app is a national security threat given its ability to collect data on its users, with some noting much of the user base is teens and young adults. However, other security experts argue the app is no more a security threat than the many other apps that collect data and point to the lack of any broad U.S. data privacy regulations. In addition to targeting just TikTok, the initial bill also banned the Apple App Store and Google's Google Play from providing the app for download to residents of Montana. Both TikTok and the stores that allowed users to download it would be subjected to a $10,000 fine per day. Google and Apple did not respond to a request for comment. TikTok also did not respond to a request for comment. In the newly drafted amendment, the language holding the stores accountable for providing TikTok for download has been removed. The original bill, which passed by a vote of 54-43, was slated to take effect next year. The drafted amendment maintains that starting date. Questions remain about how the bill would be enforced if it becomes law. Caitlin Vogus, deputy director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said that in order for a social media company to abide by the law, it will likely need to track its users' location, thereby incentivizing data collection. ""Ironically, a bill that is supposed to be about protecting user privacy may instead encourage apps to collect location data so they can make sure that they're steering clear of this prohibition if they are, in fact banned in Montana,"" Vogus said. Kyler Nerison, the communications director for the Montana Attorney General, told NBC News in a statement earlier this month that his office would investigate violations of the bill if it becomes law. The fines enacted by the law only apply to the social media companies, not individuals who use the apps. “The Montana Department of Justice would investigate reported violations and levy fines against the entities (i.e., TikTok and mobile application stores) if violations occur,” Nerison said. TikTok is already banned on state devices and networks in the state of Montana. Other states have enacted bans on state-run devices and networks as well. Some public universities also restricted access to TikTok on school computers, mobile phones and Wi-Fi, in accordance with executive orders in those states banning the app on government-owned devices and networks. The Montana bill comes amid increased scrutiny on TikTok from lawmakers across the U.S. The Biden administration is considering a ban of TikTok in the U.S. if the app’s Chinese owners refuse to sell their stakes, NBC News confirmed in March. In response, TikTok launched a charm offensive, bringing dozens of content creators to D.C. to speak with members of Congress and to hold a press conference. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew also testified before Congress, where he was grilled about the platform. "
Far right laments Tucker Carlson’s ouster and loss of its shot at the mainstream,Brandy Zadrozny,"April 26, 2023, 8:44 PM UTC",Internet,"Fox News’ dismissal of top-rated host Tucker Carlson sent shock waves through mainstream and conservative media this week. But nowhere was Carlson’s loss felt more than on the fringe and right-wing websites and forums where so many of his narratives originated. On web shows and message boards, creators of hate and conspiracy theory content bemoaned the loss of Carlson and their path to a mainstream audience. “He amplified [my] reporting more than anyone else,” Darren Beattie, a blogger and purveyor of conspiracy theories related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, said Monday on a web show hosted by Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk. “He was basically the only person on Fox who would dare to have me on, and I’m not the only case,” Beattie said. “There are other people, and nobody would dare let them on any other Fox show. But Tucker would have them on to say things that you won’t hear anywhere on American TV.” Carlson’s relationship to fringe figures on the far right was, in some ways, symbiotic. He would use his platform to attack institutions and people, unleashing a troll army drawn from the very ranks of the fringe right-wingers and 4Chan users who loved him — something the authors of this article have experienced on several occasions. Steve Bannon, a former top Trump aide who appeared Tuesday on Kirk’s show, said the “power of Tucker Carlson” was his ability to distill and package fringe political ideas to a new audience. Bannon said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the father and son who oversee Fox News’ parent company, fired Carlson to keep “those ideas [from] seeping into a more mainstream audience.” Those sentiments are backed up by academics and researchers who study how internet extremism makes its way into mainstream U.S. politics and culture. Carlson’s show repeatedly echoed conspiracy theories and disinformation that gained traction on extremist forums like 4chan — and that would otherwise not have appeared on Fox News. “Once a story reached Tucker Carlson, it was at the apex of conservative media, and Fox News is the voice of authority in conservative media,” said Robert Faris, a senior researcher at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who studies networked digital technologies and media. “It let other people know that it’s OK to talk about these kinds of things in the language that they use. Just that it’s on the air, it’s ambient and it’s on in so many public spaces means that anything they platform has a wider reach than any of the more committed hyper-partisan sites.” A spokesperson for Fox News declined to comment beyond the statement the company issued announcing Carlson’s departure and thanking him for his work there. Carlson used his platform at Fox News to spread information that had been widely discredited. Carlson featured a segment this month claiming that Ukrainian casualties in the Russian invasion were widely underreported. He was citing an altered document that first appeared on 4chan and had been widely debunked before the segment aired. Days before that, Carlson devoted a segment to a 4chan hoax about a “Trans Day of Vengeance” that was being promoted on April Fools’ Day. As evidence, he aired a tweet from an anti-Black troll account whose name alludes to a racial slur. Carlson also used his platform to turn his audience on certain people. Most recently, Ray Epps, who has sought a retraction over Carlson’s false allegations that he worked for the federal government and helped incite the riot at the Capitol, said on CBS News’ “60 Minutes” that he believed Carlson was trying to destroy his life. The authors of this article saw that firsthand at times when Carlson aired segments about our reporting and even lobbed personal and professional attacks at us, alleging that legitimate reporting was an effort to ruin lives and that reporting on social media platforms was activism for censorship.

'Sludge content' is the latest form of escapism on TikTok,Uwa Ede-Osifo,"April 26, 2023, 6:22 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"It's content that could be born only out of TikTok’s frenetic video onslaught. So-called sludge videos have flourished on the app and other parts of the internet in recent months, offering viewers split-screen looks at two, and sometimes even three or four, videos at once. The videos are typically compiled from two or more unrelated sources: a popular game component such as Subway Surfers, an automated voice reading a confessional Reddit story time, an ASMR clip such as a bar of soap being cut or a scene from a cartoon or a television show. To unsuspecting users, the videos can be nuisances, but to “sludge fans,” the overstimulating videos offer solace. “NOT ENOUGH STIMULATION. I NEED SOAP VIDEOS,” a user commented on a sludge content video. “my mind feels whole,” another wrote. Experimental editing styles are not new to TikTok; #corecore videos, for example, are also collaged, and they are viewed as a poetic storytelling form. By comparison, sludge content veers far from literal meaning and leans, instead, into an abstract chaos produced by mixing different audio-visual content. Some sludge content videos have neatly split screens, while others feature dizzying patchworks of videos that overlay one another. In the latter variation, videos continue to pop up on the screen over the collages. The origins of sludge content are unclear, but it is linked to an online tradition of repackaging recognizable bits of the internet, said Nick Seaver, the director of the Science, Technology, and Society Center at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Deep fried memes, for example, involved transforming popular images with heavy filters and color saturation, he said. There is “a history of putting copyrighted content on YouTube but other videos around it so that the copyright filter doesn’t get triggered,” Seaver said. “One thing you clearly are seeing here is a kind of imitation, people recognizing that other videos like this exist,” he said. On the consumer side, part of sludge content's appeal is its escapist nature. The videos are rife with distractions. “It functions as something playful, that can take your mind off things, and doesn’t require you to dive deep,” said Andreas Schellewald, a doctoral researcher of social media at Goldsmiths, University of London. “You can sit there and watch things unfold in front of your eyes.” Some users who are wary about the rise of the genre expressed concerns that sludge content reflected a declining attention span among TikTok users and that it promoted “brain rot.” “TikTok has ruined the average attention span so rapidly,” a user captioned. “What’s going on with this?” another creator said in a video. “Our attention span is so low we have to be distracted from the 30 second video we’re watching by another 30 second video in the video?” Such discourse has also led to jokes that the only way to get someone's attention IRL (in real life) is to play a video clip of Subway Surfers, a signature of sludge content: “POV: I notice I'm losing your attention during rounds,” a user captioned a video simulating an interaction in which he would display a game to get someone to focus on his medical lecture. Seaver said that while concerns about how social media content affects the brain are not unfounded, it is common for conversations about attention span to become moralized “to talk about the way people ought to behave.” “I don’t think it’s very useful to point to, like, any new media and be, like, see, 'This is evidence that we're falling,'” he said. Sludge content “is made by someone for some reason. It's not just, like, a natural phenomenon that tells us something about ourselves.” "
Children under 13 would be banned from social media under bipartisan Senate bill,Rebecca Shabad,"April 26, 2023, 5:57 PM UTC",Congress,"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of senators on Wednesday introduced legislation that aims to protect children from any harmful effects posed by using social media. The Protecting Kids on Social Media Act would set a minimum age of 13 to use social media apps, such as Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, and would require parental consent for 13- to 17-year-olds. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said earlier this year that 13 is too young to join social media. The bill would ban social media companies from recommending content using algorithms for users under the age of 18. It would also require the companies to employ age verification measures, and instructs them to create a pilot project for a government-provided age verification system that platforms could use. Under the measure, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would be given authority to enforce the bill's provisions. ""Big tech has exposed our kids to dangerous content and disturbed people,"" one of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said at a news conference. ""Moms and dads have felt helpless while their kids suffer, sometimes leading to devastating tragedies."" Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii., another lead sponsor, said that the bill is a ""commonsense and bipartisan approach to help stop this suffering"" that has resulted from teens using social media. ""By instituting these simple, straightforward guidelines, we’ll be able to give the next generation of children what every parent wants for their child, which is a chance to grow up happy and healthy,"" he said. The other two main sponsors are Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Katie Britt, R-Ala., who said her family ""constantly"" has conversations about social media. ""We have to take a step back and as parents say, how can we protect our children, teach them how to use this tool, to use it for good, and to be intentional in doing that?"" she said. Some of the most popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram require that users who create accounts be at least 13 years old. While TikTok requires that users who post content be at least 13, it also offers ""a curated, view-only experience for those under age 13 that includes additional safeguards and privacy protections."" The company says it partners with Common Sense Networks, a media company whose mission is to create media that's safe for kids and families, to ensure that content for that age group is appropriate and safe. Lawmakers recently grilled the CEO of TikTok at a congressional hearing about the company's age requirements and mechanisms put in place to protect children from dangerous content. In a press release Wednesday, the group of senators pointed to mental health data among young people, contending that there's a clear link to social media. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 57% of high school girls and 29% of high school boys felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021, with 22% percent of all high school students reporting they had seriously considered attempting suicide in the preceding year, the lawmakers noted. Other studies in recent years have suggested that social media has been linked to a rise in mental health disorders in teens and depression in adults. In February, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a bill that would set the minimum age limit to use social media at 16. And recently, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, signed two pieces of sweeping social media regulation into law that require social media companies to get parental consent for minors using their services. "
"Students’ psychological reports, abuse allegations leaked by ransomware hackers",Kevin Collier,"April 26, 2023, 12:37 PM UTC",Security,"Hackers who broke into the Minneapolis Public Schools earlier this year have circulated an enormous cache of files that appear to include highly sensitive documents on schoolchildren and teachers, including allegations of teacher abuse and students’ psychological reports. The files appeared online in March after the school district announced that it had been the victim of a ransomware cyberattack. NBC News was able to download the cache of documents and reviewed about 500 files. Some were printed on school letterheads. Many were listed in folder sets named after Minneapolis schools. NBC News was able to view the leaked files after downloading them from links posted to the hacker group’s Telegram account. NBC News has not verified the authenticity of the cache, which totals about 200,000 files, and Minneapolis Public Schools declined to answer specific questions about the documents, instead pointing to its previous public statements. The files reviewed by NBC News include everything from relatively benign data like contact information to far more sensitive information including descriptions of students’ behavioral problems and teachers’ Social Security numbers. In addition to leaking the documents, the hacking group appeared to go a step further, posting about the documents on Twitter and Facebook as well as on a website, which hosted a video that opens with an animated short of a flaming motorcycle, followed by 50 minutes of screengrabs of the stolen files. NBC News is not naming the group. It’s a stark reminder that schools often hold reams of sensitive information, and that such leaks often leave parents and administrators with little recourse once their information is released. “The fact of the matter is, school districts really should be treating this more like nuclear waste, where they need to identify it and contain it and make sure that access to it is restricted,” said Doug Levin, the director of the K12 Security Information Exchange, a nonprofit that helps schools protect themselves from hackers. “Organizations that are supposed to be helping to uplift children and prepare them for the future could instead be introducing significant headwinds to their lives just for participating in public school.” School districts really should be treating this more like nuclear waste. — Doug Levin, the director of the K12 Security Information Exchange In an update published to the Minneapolis Public Schools website on April 11, Interim Superintendent Rochelle Cox said the school district was working with “external specialists and law enforcement to review the data” that was posted online. Cox also said the district was reaching out to individuals whose information had been found in the leak. Cox also warned about reports that people had received messages telling them their information had been leaked. “This week, we’re seeing an uptick in reports of messages — sometimes multiple messages — sent to people in our community stating something like ‘your social security number has been posted on the dark web,’” Cox wrote. “First — I want to remind everyone to NOT interact with such messages unless you KNOW the sender.” Cybersecurity experts who are familiar with the leak have said it is among the worst they can remember. “It’s awful. As bad as I’ve seen,” Brett Callow, an analyst who tracks ransomware attacks for the cybersecurity company Emsisoft, said about the breach. Ransomware attacks on schools, which often end with the hackers releasing sensitive information, have become frequent across the U.S. since 2015. At least 122 public school districts in the U.S. have been hit with ransomware since 2021, Callow said, with more than half — 76 — resulting in the hackers leaking sensitive school and student data. In such cases, districts often provide parents and students with identity theft protection services, though it’s impossible for them to keep the files from being shared after they’re posted. The leak has left some Minneapolis parents wondering what to do next. “I feel like my hands are tied and I feel like the information that the district is giving us is just very limited,” said Heather Paulson, who teaches high school in the district and is the mother of a younger child who attends school in Minneapolis. Lydia Kauppi, a parent of a student in the district, said it’s unsettling to know that her family’s private information may have been shared by hackers. “It causes anxiety on multiple, multiple fronts for everybody involved,” she said. “And it’s just kind of one of those weird, vague, unsettling feelings, because you just don’t know how long do I have to worry about it?” Minneapolis Public Schools, which oversees around 30,000 students across 68 schools, said on April 11 it was continuing to notify people who had been affected by the breach, and that it was offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to victims. Ransomware hackers have drastically escalated their tactics in recent years, increasing how much they ask for and launching efforts to pressure schools to pay up — including by contacting people whose information has been leaked. The group that hacked the Minneapolis schools publicly demanded $1 million. The district announced in March that it had not paid, and ransomware gangs usually only leak large datasets of victims who refuse to pay. Since last year, various criminal hacker groups have leaked troves of files on some of the largest school districts in the country, including in Los Angeles and Chicago. The leaked Minneapolis files appear to include dossiers on hundreds of children with special needs, identifying each by name, birthday and school. Those dossiers often include pages of details about students, including problems at home like divorcing or incarcerated parents, conditions like attention deficit disorder, documented indications where they appear to have been injured, results of intelligence tests and what medications they take. Other files include databases of instances where teachers have written up students for behavioral issues, sorted by school, student ID number, behavioral issue and the students’ race. The leaked files also include hundreds of forms documenting times when faculty learned that a student had been potentially mistreated. Most of those are allegations that a student had suffered neglect or was physically harmed by a teacher or student. Some are extraordinarily sensitive and allege incidents like a student’s being sexually abused by a teacher or by another student. Each report names the victim and cites birthday and address. In one report, a special education student claimed her bus driver groped her and made her touch him. Minnesota police later charged a man whose name matches the driver named in the report and the date of the incident. Others describe a teacher accused of having had romantic relationships with two students. Another describes a student whom faculty suspected was the victim of female genital mutilation. NBC News was able to verify that faculty listed in those reports worked for Minneapolis schools but has not verified those reports. Those files have been promoted online in what experts said is an unorthodox and particularly aggressive manner. Many ransomware hacker groups create blogs on the dark web — sites that aren’t findable through search engines like Google and Bing — where they post files from victims who don’t pay. The group behind the Minneapolis hack keeps such a blog, which is widely tracked by cybersecurity experts. But it also appears to maintain a more conventional website, registered in November, that posts “reviews” of each of its hacking exploits alongside news stories copied from other sites. The news site doesn’t review any other hackers’ leaks. Both websites point to the same social media accounts. Posts on Twitter and Facebook bragging about the Minneapolis attack remained live on those social media accounts as of Monday morning. The posts direct people to the news website, which includes both a 50-minute video where the hackers show off the files and instructions on how visitors can download them. “What’s unusual is the number of platforms this group uses to promote leaks, including Facebook and Twitter,” said Callow, the ransomware expert. “And their use of video is, I believe, unique,” he said. “Gangs have shared videos privately with victims before, but this is the first time recordings of stolen data have been publicly shared.” Paulson, the teacher and parent, said that she has taken some steps to prevent further harm but is out of ideas on what else she could do. “I froze my credit, my son’s credit,” she said. “And more than that, I’ve just been watching and hoping that nothing is going to happen.

Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"Ryan Browne, CNBC","April 26, 2023, 12:10 PM UTC",Video Games,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block Microsoft’s acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard. The measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition. Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision. Shares of Activision Blizzard slumped 10% in U.S. pre-market. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market. Microsoft could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform, Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the space, the CMA said. Cloud gaming is a technology that enables gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a mainstream way of playing games. “Allowing Microsoft to take such a strong position in the cloud gaming market just as it begins to grow rapidly would risk undermining the innovation that is crucial to the development of these opportunities,” the CMA said in a press release Wednesday. Microsoft offered the CMA remedies in an attempt to resolve its concerns — including “requirements governing what games must be offered by Microsoft to what platforms and on what conditions over a ten-year period” — however the regulator rejected the proposals. “Given the remedy applies only to a defined set of Activision games, which can be streamed only in a defined set of cloud gaming services, provided they are purchased in a defined set of online stores, there are significant risks of disagreement and conflict between Microsoft and cloud gaming service providers, particularly over a ten-year period in a rapidly changing market,” the CMA said. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement that it remained “fully committed to this acquisition and will appeal.” “The CMA’s decision rejects a pragmatic path to address competition concerns and discourages technology innovation and investment in the United Kingdom,” Smith said Wednesday. “We have already signed contracts to make Activision Blizzard’s popular games available on 150 million more devices, and we remain committed to reinforcing these agreements through regulatory remedies. We’re especially disappointed that after lengthy deliberations, this decision appears to reflect a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works.” Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard, told employees in a letter Wednesday that two companies have “already begun the work to appeal to the UK Competition Appeals Tribunal.” “We’re confident in our case because the facts are on our side: this deal is good for competition,” he said. “At a time when the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence are thriving, we know the U.K. market would benefit from Microsoft’s bench strength in both domains, as well as our ability to put those technologies to use immediately,” Kotick added. “By contrast, if the CMA’s decision holds, it would stifle investment, competition, and job creation throughout the UK gaming industry.” Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen to date. Executives at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content offerings. However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise for certain platforms. Sony, in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase. The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, Nintendo, Nvidia and other firms 10-year agreements to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms. Microsoft argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms. Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same features. Sony still opposes the deal. The CMA had raised concerns with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release. Cloud gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband connection to work well. Cloud gaming made up only a fraction of global internet traffic in 2022. Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU continues to probe the merger to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal on antitrust grounds. "
"Dave Hollis, ex-husband of self-help author Rachel Hollis, had a fatal trio of drugs in his system when he died",Diana Dasrath,"April 25, 2023, 7:00 PM UTC",U.S. news,"Dave Hollis, a former Disney executive and the ex-husband of celebrated self-help author Rachel Hollis, died of an accidental overdose this year, authorities have determined. Hollis, 47, had fatal amounts of cocaine, fentanyl and alcohol in his system when he died at his home outside Austin, Texas, on Feb. 12, according to an autopsy conducted by the Travis County Medical Examiner’s Office and obtained by NBC News on Tuesday. Hollis, who had been the head of distribution for Disney before he left the company in 2018 to join his wife’s business, had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, depression, high blood pressure and hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, according to the autopsy. The disease causes vessels that supply blood to the heart to narrow and harden, the autopsy says. The couple separated in 2020 after Rachel Hollis, author of the bestseller “Girl, Wash Your Face,” said they failed to make their relationship of 18 years work. In an Instagram post at the time, she said they concluded it was “healthier and more respectful for us to choose this as the end of our journey as a married couple.” They remained close friends and would continue to co-parent and run their company as partners, she added. Before he left Disney in 2018, Hollis oversaw the releases of “Black Panther” and the “Star Wars” franchise, among other properties. "
"Iran-linked hackers broke into election results website in 2020, general says",Kevin Collier,"April 25, 2023, 6:17 PM UTC",Security,"Hackers working for Iran broke into a U.S. city’s website ahead of the 2020 election with the possible intention of altering the unofficial vote counts shown on Election Day, a senior military cyber official said Monday. The alleged incident, which has not been previously reported, is distinct from other allegations of Iranian election interference attempts that U.S. officials announced in the days before that election. The U.S. removed the hackers before they could do any harm. Army Maj. Gen. William J. Hartman, head of U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force, which specializes in operations like protecting elections, described the incident at the RSA Conference, a cybersecurity industry event. Hartman declined to share specifics about the incident. “All I’m going to tell you is that we were able to go out and remediate the access that they had in these networks,” he said. The hackers were members of a hacker group that the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike calls “Pioneer Kitten,” Hartman said. CrowdStrike has reported that those hackers are likely to be contractors working for Iran and that they specialize in gaining access to sensitive systems. “We detected that that malicious cyber actor had gained access to a city’s local infrastructure that would be used to report the results of voting for the 2020 elections,” Hartman said. Hartman did not say which city’s website was breached. “To be clear, this isn’t infrastructure involved in casting a vote,” Hartman added. Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment U.S. Cyber Command specializes in addressing foreign cyber threats and rarely speaks openly about their operations. Cyber Command worked to get the news of the attack on the U.S. city’s networks declassified specifically to present that information at the conference, a spokesperson said. The subject of Hartman’s panel was the work that the Cyber National Mission Force conducts with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the federal government’s top cyber defense advisory body. He spoke at the event with CISA’s second in command, Eric Goldstein. “Given the target and given the actor, we wanted to move quickly,” Goldstein said. Most equipment directly involved with casting a ballot in U.S. elections is not connected to the internet, making hacking those systems at scale practically impossible. But that means that other aspects of the voting process that are online can be targets for malicious hackers. Local governments often manage their own election-night reporting websites that report the results of elections as they’re tallied. While those results aren’t official, news reporters and the public can check them as votes come in to estimate election results. Election security experts have long warned that election-night reporting websites can be targets for attack. Russia allegedly hacked the Ukrainian presidential election reporting site in 2014 to make it falsely appear that a fringe pro-Russia candidate won in an enormous upset. Hartman’s example is believed to be the first public instance of an allegation detailing a foreign government’s trying to hack an election-night reporting site in the U.S. The U.S. previously accused Iran of orchestrating a campaign to sow doubts about the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, including obtaining voter records from one state and sending threatening emails to some voters. The Justice Department charged two Iranian nationals over the incident. "
"Big Tech crackdown looms as E.U., U.K. ready new rules",Associated Press,"April 25, 2023, 5:59 PM UTC",Tech News,"TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Google and Amazon are facing rising pressure from European authorities as London and Brussels advanced new rules Tuesday to curb the power of digital companies. They’re among those on a list of the 19 biggest online platforms and search engines that the European Union’s executive arm said must meet extra obligations for cleaning up illegal content and disinformation and keeping users safe under the 27-nation bloc’s landmark digital rules that take effect later this year. The U.K. government, meanwhile, unveiled draft legislation that would give regulators more power to protect consumers from online scams and fake reviews and boost digital competition. The updates help solidify Europe’s reputation as the global leader in efforts to rein in the power of social media companies and other digital platforms. TikTok will allow European Commission officials to carry out a “stress test” of its systems to ensure they comply with the Digital Services Act, Commissioner Thierry Breton said in an online briefing. He proposed the idea to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew when they met in Brussels earlier this year. “I’m happy that they came back to us saying they are interested,” Breton said, but added that he’s waiting for Chew to provide a date. TikTok did not reply to a request for comment. Twitter had agreed earlier to a stress test, and Breton said he and his team will travel to the company’s headquarters in San Francisco at the end of June to carry out the voluntary mock exercise. Breton didn’t detail what the test would entail. Starting Aug. 25, the biggest online platforms will have to give European users more control by making it easier to report illegal content like hate speech and providing more information on why their systems recommend certain content. There are guardrails for content generated by artificial intelligence like deepfake videos and synthetic images, which will have to be clearly labeled when they come up in search results, Breton said. Platforms will have to “completely redesign” their systems to ensure high a level of privacy and safety for children, including verifying users’ ages, Breton said. Big Tech companies also will have to revamp their systems to “prevent algorithmic amplification of disinformation,” he said, saying he was particularly concerned about Facebook’s content moderation systems ahead of September elections in Slovakia. “Now that Facebook has been designated as a very large online platform, Meta needs to carefully investigate its system and fix it where needed ASAP,” he said. Facebook’s parent company said it supports the EU’s new Digital Services Act. “We are already taking extensive steps to ensure we meet the DSA’s requirements, including expanding and evolving our existing transparency tools and reporting systems,” Meta said. Violations could result in fines worth up to 6% of a company’s annual global revenue — amounting to billions of dollars — or even a ban on operating in the EU. The European Commission’s list of very large online platforms is limited to those with at least 45 million users in Europe, which includes Google’s Search, Play, Maps, Shopping and YouTube services; Amazon Marketplace; Apple’s App Store; Microsoft’s Bing and LinkedIn; Meta’s Facebook and Instagram; plus Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, Wikipedia, Booking.com, China’s Alibaba Aliexpress and German ecommerce company Zalando. Breton said more platforms could be added, and the commission is analyzing “four to five” others that it will decide on in coming weeks. In Britain, the government’s Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers bill proposed Tuesday would give watchdogs more teeth to counter the dominance of tech companies, backed by the threat of fines worth up to 10% of their annual revenue. Under the proposals, online platforms and search engines could be required to give rivals access to their data or be more transparent about how their app stores and marketplaces work. The rules would make it illegal to hire someone to write a fake review or allow the posting of online consumer reviews “without taking reasonable steps” to verify they’re genuine. They also would make it easier for consumers get out of online subscriptions. The new rules, which still need go through the legislative process and secure parliamentary approval, would apply only to companies with 25 million pounds ($31 billion) in global revenue or 1 billion pounds in U.K. revenue.

Prince William got 'very large sum' in Murdoch phone hacking settlement,Associated Press,"April 25, 2023, 2:36 PM UTC",U.K. Royals,"Prince William, the heir to the British throne, quietly received “a very large sum of money” in a 2020 settlement with the British newspaper arm of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire for phone hacking, according to court documents aired Tuesday in one of his brother’s lawsuits. Prince Harry’s lawyer made the revelation in a summary of arguments about why Harry’s lawsuit against the publisher of The Sun and now-defunct News Of The World should not be thrown out. The suit alleges the newspapers unlawfully gathered information in a scandal dating back two decades. News Group Newspapers, which Murdoch owns, argued that a High Court judge should throw out phone hacking lawsuits by the prince and actor Hugh Grant because the claims were brought too late. But Harry, the Duke of Sussex, said he was prevented from bringing his case because of a secret agreement between the royal family and the newspapers that called for a settlement and apology. The deal, which the prince said was authorized by the late Queen Elizabeth II, would have prevented future litigation from the royals. Harry began pushing for a resolution in 2017 but said he “had enough” after the publisher “filibustered.” He filed suit in 2019. The papers said William, Prince of Wales, later settled for a large, but undisclosed sum. “It is important to bear in mind that in responding to this bid by NGN to prevent his claims going to trial, (Harry) has had to make public the details of this secret agreement, as well as the fact that his brother, His Royal Highness Prince William, has recently settled his claim against NGN behind the scenes,” attorney David Sherborne wrote. “This is used very much by (Harry) as ‘a shield not a sword’ against NGN’s attack.” The lawsuit is one of several that Harry has brought against British newspapers, including two other phone hacking cases. When contacted by NBC News, a spokesperson for News UK — the trading name for News Group Newspapers — declined to immediately comment. NBC News has also reached out to Buckingham Palace. "
Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News but welcome on Russian TV,Patrick Smith,"April 25, 2023, 12:39 PM UTC",War in Ukraine,"If Tucker Carlson is looking for work, the Kremlin could have the answer. Just hours after Fox News unexpectedly announced his departure, Carlson was offered work by Russian state media networks that have fiercely supported the invasion of Ukraine and echo much of his conspiratorial rhetoric. Carlson is known for his critical views on Western support for Kyiv, and he has used his platform to question the huge amounts of financial and military aid the U.S. has sent to help repel Moscow's year-old invasion. RT, the broadcaster formerly known as Russia Today, which is banned in dozens of countries, including the entire European Union, said on its English-language Twitter account Monday: ""Hey @TuckerCarlson, you can always question more with @RT_com."" Vladimir Solovyov, the most prominent commentator on Russian state TV and a staunch pro-Kremlin propagandist, said Carlson was welcome to join his nightly panel discussion show — while suggesting he should consider a run for the White House. ""You have our admiration and support in any endeavor you choose for yourself next, be it running for President of the United States (which you should totally do, by the way) or making an independent media project,"" he wrote in an email, according to a screen grab he shared on his Telegram channel. ""We'll happily offer you a job if you wish to carry on as a presenter and host! You are always welcome in Russia and Moscow, we wish you the best of luck."" Alongside the message on Telegram, Solovyov wrote in English: ""Tucker, come join us. You don't have to be afraid of taking the piss out of Biden here,"" using a common British expression for mocking someone. Speculation is swirling over where Carlson may find work next, whether it is on another right-leaning news network in the U.S. or elsewhere. Carlson has strong links to Hungary and its far-right authoritarian and pro-Russian leader, Viktor Orbán, whom he has interviewed. Carlson hosted his Fox News show from the capital, Budapest, for a week in 2021. In 2022 Carlson made a documentary titled “Hungary vs. Soros: Fight for Civilization” — a reference to George Soros, the 92-year-old Hungarian-born Jewish businessman and philanthropist who has become a scapegoat for conservative conspiracy theorists in Europe and the U.S. Carlson has consistently criticized Ukraine since the February 2022 invasion and has often argued that the U.S. is the real combatant in a proxy war against Russia, a point also made by Russian propagandists. He has referred to Ukraine as an undemocratic ""client state"" of the U.S. State Department and has called the notion that it is fighting for its sovereignty ""a lie."" He has called President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — who is lauded around the world for the steadfast defense of his country — a ""dictator"" who has misused the more than $77 billion the U.S. has sent in aid, Carlson has argued. ""You can't have an audit. Because if you do want an audit of where your money is going into the most corrupt country in Europe, you're a tool of Putin!"" Carlson said on his Fox News show in March. Jon Roozenbeek, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge and an expert in Russian propaganda and disinformation, said the job offers may be an attempt to ""troll"" the West rather than genuine. ""He’s probably much more useful at any kind of American outlet that isn’t actively and openly sponsored by the Russian government,"" he said. Russia's propaganda aims are not necessarily to persuade people to accept its position, Roozenbeek said, but to ""sow doubt or uncertainty or to raise pulses and raise emotions"" and make sure the Russian position is heard as much as possible in mainstream discussion. ""And so the bigger the voice that propagates these kinds of narratives, the better,"" he said. Western governments have steadily restricted Russian state TV channels since the conflict in Ukraine began in 2014 when Russian-backed paramilitary groups set up internationally unrecognized administrations in Luhansk and Donetsk, the same year Russia sparked outrage across the world by annexing Crimea.

Tucker Carlson and Fox News part ways,Daniel Arkin,"April 24, 2023, 3:43 PM UTC / Updated April 25, 2023, 10:15 AM UTC",News,"Fox News said Monday it is parting ways with firebrand anchor Tucker Carlson, the network's most popular prime-time host and a leading voice in the modern conservative movement known for his conspiratorial rhetoric and culture-warrior provocations. The network announced the stunning news days after it agreed to pay nearly $800 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avert a high-stakes defamation trial that had cast a shadow over the future of the network. ""FOX News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways,"" the company said in a short news release. ""Mr. Carlson's last program was Friday April 21st."" Carlson's most recent broadcast did not feature any indication that he was preparing to leave the network. ""We'll be back on Monday,"" he said cheerfully at the end of Friday's episode. Fox News did not specify why Carlson is leaving, and a spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email from NBC News requesting more information on his abrupt exit. The network's statement did not include any comment from Carlson. The network will rely on a rotation of interim hosts until it names a permanent anchor for the 8 p.m. ET programming block. The decision to part ways with Carlson was made by Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch and Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Brian Kilmeade anchored the 8 p.m. hour on Monday and opened the show with a brief statement addressing the elephant in the room: ""As you probably have heard, Fox News and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways. I wish Tucker the best."" ""I'm great friends with Tucker and always will be,"" Kilmeade added. ""But right now, it’s time for 'Fox News Tonight,' so let’s get started."" ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" a cornerstone of the Fox News  lineup since 2016, was one of the most-watched shows on American cable news, outpacing rivals at CNN and MSNBC. Carlson, 53, established himself as one of the most influential figures in a conservative political coalition reshaped by former President Donald Trump. He regularly drew controversy for incendiary statements about race, immigration, LGBTQ rights and other topics. Carlson faced fierce criticism last year when extremism experts drew a connection between his on-air statements and the ""great replacement"" white nationalist views espoused by a gunman who killed 10 people in Buffalo, New York. He also attracted intense scrutiny for spreading political misinformation, fostering conspiracy theories about the results of the 2020 presidential election, minimizing the severity of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and attacking journalists at other outlets. In the lead-up to the Dominion trial, Carlson's internal communications were released and showed him criticizing Trump and acknowledging that claims about voter fraud in the 2020  election were baseless. ""I hate him passionately,"" Carlson said in a text message to an unidentified person on Jan. 4, 2021, according to exhibits unsealed before the Dominion trial was set to begin. (Fox and Dominion settled the suit for $787.5 million last Tuesday, just as opening statements were to start. Dominion declined to comment on Monday.) But Carlson later backtracked and recently devoted a full episode of his show to an interview with Trump, who is once again seeking the Republican nomination for president. The stock price of Fox Corp., the parent company of Fox News, dropped sharply after Carlson’s departure became public, dipping more than 4%. Fox News faces other lawsuits related to statements anchors made in the wake of the 2020 election. The network is also being sued by Abby Grossberg, a former producer for Carlson who alleges the company is a hotbed of discrimination and misogyny. Grossberg, who once worked as the head of booking on Carlson's show, alleged in a legal filing that the anchor created ""a work environment that subjugated women based on vile sexist stereotypes, typecasted religious minorities and belittled their traditions, and demonstrated little to no regard for mental health."" Fox has disputed Grossberg's claims, and a spokeswoman for the network recently said: ""We will continue to vigorously defend Fox against Ms. Grossberg’s unmeritorious legal claims, which are riddled with false allegations against Fox and our employees."" Grossberg's attorney, Gerry Filippatos, said Monday that they'd discussed possible settlement talks with a third-party mediator over the weekend and that those talks had ended ""unfruitfully"" on Monday. An outside lawyer investigated Grossberg's allegations, Filippatos said, and Fox News conveyed to Grossberg's lawyers after her firing that her allegations were ""unfounded."" The television news industry was rattled yet again on Monday when CNN anchor Don Lemon shared on Twitter that he had been terminated by the network after 17 years there. Lemon recently provoked backlash for on-air comments about GOP presidential contender Nikki Haley’s age. In addition to hosting a popular prime-time show, Carlson was also one of the marquee personalities on the company's nascent streaming platform, Fox Nation, after signing a new deal with the company in 2021. ""Tucker Carlson Originals,"" a documentary series, recently profiled people who eat bugs. Carlson took over the 8 p.m. ET time slot after the departure of Bill O'Reilly, who left the network in 2017 amid a series of sexual harassment allegations. O'Reilly's attorney denied any misconduct at the time. Earlier in his career, Carlson put in stints at CNN and MSNBC. He also co-founded the conservative commentary website The Daily Caller and wrote articles for various magazines, including Esquire and The Atlantic. "
"CNBC anchor Hadley Gamble accused NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell of sexual harassment, her lawyer says",Daniel Arkin,"April 24, 2023, 7:19 PM UTC / Updated April 24, 2023, 9:59 PM UTC",News,"Hadley Gamble, a CNBC anchor and international correspondent, accused former NBCUniversal chief executive Jeff Shell of sexual harassment and sex discrimination in a complaint to the media company, her lawyer told NBC News on Monday. Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal, announced Sunday that Shell was exiting ""effective immediately"" after an outside legal counsel investigation into ""inappropriate conduct."" NBC News and CNBC are both units of NBCUniversal. The corporation did not specify how Shell had violated company policy. In a separate statement, Shell said that he had had an ""inappropriate relationship with a woman at the company."" Gamble's claims appear to go further than that characterization. In a statement, Gamble's lawyer, Suzanne McKie, said ""the investigation into Mr. Shell arose from a complaint by my client of sexual harassment and sex discrimination."" ""Given these circumstances,"" McKie added, ""it is very disappointing that my client’s name has been released and her privacy violated."" (Gamble's name was first reported by the entertainment news website Deadline.) Comcast did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on the apparent discrepancy in the language used by Shell and Gamble's lawyer. In a Securities and Exchange Commission document filed on Monday, Comcast wrote: ""Following a complaint that Jeffrey Shell, CEO of NBCUniversal, engaged in inappropriate conduct with a female employee, including allegations of sexual harassment, Comcast Corporation (the “Company”) retained outside counsel to investigate the allegations. During the investigation, evidence was uncovered that corroborated the allegations. As a consequence, on April 23, 2023, the Company terminated Mr. Shell’s employment With Cause under his employment agreement, effective immediately."" Gamble covers energy, geopolitics and financial markets, according to a profile on CNBC's website. She is the anchor of CNBC's ""Capital Connection,"" a show that broadcasts daily from the network's Middle East headquarters in the United Arab Emirates. Shell did not immediately reply to an email requesting comment on McKie's statement. In the statement he released Sunday, Shell apologized for his conduct and said: ""I'm truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down."" Shell was named as successor to former NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke in late 2019 and formally stepped into the role in January 2020. He was previously the chairman of the company’s film and entertainment unit. He oversaw a sprawling portfolio of media assets that includes the Universal Pictures film studio, the Peacock streaming service and cable channels such as Bravo, E! and the USA Network. Shell's tenure as CEO was defined in large part by the pandemic. Universal theme parks and movie theaters shut down just months after he took over, upending the leisure industry and entertainment business. "
Don Lemon says he has been fired from CNN,Doha Madani,"April 24, 2023, 4:19 PM UTC",News,"Don Lemon was terminated from his anchor role at CNN, he announced Monday. The news comes after Variety published a story this month about allegations that he mistreated his female colleagues over his career there. And earlier this year, he faced backlash over widely criticized comments he made on air. Lemon announced the news on Twitter, saying he was informed by his agent that he was being terminated. ""I am stunned,"" Lemon wrote. ""After 17 years at CNN I would have thought someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly."" In a tweet, CNN refuted Lemon's account as ""inaccurate."" The network said he was offered a chance to meet with management but ""instead released a statement on Twitter."" CNN CEO Chris Licht said that the network and Lemon have ""parted ways,"" according to a memo provided to NBC News on Monday. ""Don will forever be a part of the CNN family, and we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years,"" the statement said. ""We wish him well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors."" Lemon joined CNN in 2006 after anchoring at NBC Chicago and working as a correspondent for NBC News, the ""TODAY"" show and ""NBC Nightly News."" Lemon first came under fire in February during a segment on “CNN This Morning” in which he remarked that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, 51, was no longer in her “prime.” The comment was made while discussing a suggestion by Haley that candidates over the age of 75 should be subject to mental competency exams. “Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime, sorry,” Lemon said. “When a woman is considered to be in her prime — in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s.” When pushed by co-anchor Poppy Harlow, Lemon told her not to “shoot the messenger.” Licht told employees that Lemon agreed to partake in training following public backlash to his comments. He also told Semafor earlier this month that both CNN and Lemon have ""moved on"" from the issue. “Don Lemon is a lightning rod because he really came to prominence during an era where that was celebrated and encouraged in prime time,"" Licht said. But a Variety report published April 5 alleged that Lemon has a long history of questionable behavior toward women. The report was based on more than a dozen former and current colleagues, Variety said, who described Lemon as openly hostile to women at the network. Most of the sources spoke anonymously to the outlet. NBC News has not independently verified the allegations. A spokesperson for Lemon said in a statement to NBC News following the report that it was “amazing and disappointing that Variety would be so reckless.” “The story, which is riddled with patently false anecdotes and no concrete evidence, is entirely based on unsourced, unsubstantiated, 15-year-old anonymous gossip,” the statement said. Responding to an NBC News request for comment, CNN referred to statements it made to Variety that Lemon denied the allegations and that the network — regarding a specific allegation from 2008 — was unable to “corroborate the alleged events from 15 years ago.” Lemon’s termination comes less than two years after former anchor Chris Cuomo was fired from the network. Cuomo, who anchored his own primetime show for CNN, was fired in December 2021 after an attorney general investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against his brother, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The investigation revealed the depth of Cuomo’s role in helping his brother fight the allegations. He had previously disclosed some conversations with his brother but the attorney general report revealed a “greater level of involvement” than CNN was aware of, the network said at the time. Cuomo filed legal action against CNN seeking $125 million for wrongful termination last year, which is still pending. "
Supreme Court takes up legal spat over public officials blocking people on social media,Lawrence Hurley,"April 24, 2023, 1:34 PM UTC / Updated April 24, 2023, 2:52 PM UTC",Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether people can sue public officials who block them on social media — a legal question left unresolved in a previous case involving former President Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The court took up two separate cases involving much-lower-profile figures: two members of the Poway Unified School District Board of Trustees in southern California and the city manager of Port Huron, Michigan. But the legal dispute is the same: Can blocking someone on social media give rise to a free speech violation under the Constitution’s First Amendment? It's a recurring question that has arisen at all levels of government as elected officials increasingly use social media to interact with voters. The Supreme Court's ruling will have a broad impact in guiding how lower courts handle such cases. ""As many courts have held, it doesn’t matter whether it’s the president or a local city manager, government officials can’t block people from these forums simply because they don’t like what they’re saying,"" said Katie Fallow, a lawyer at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which was involved in the lawsuit against Trump. ""The Supreme Court should reaffirm that basic First Amendment principle."" In the California case, board members Michelle O’Connor-Ratcliff and T.J. Zane in 2017 blocked Christopher and Kimberly Garnier, parents of students in the school district, from commenting on their Facebook pages, and in the case of O’Connor-Ratcliff, responding to her Twitter posts. Zane has since left office. The frequent comments by the Garniers were not profane or violent but were repetitive and lengthy, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in a 2022 ruling in favor of the couple, which upheld a similar ruling by a federal judge in the Southern District of California. The appeals court concluded that the elected officials were acting in their official capacities and that social media accounts are akin to a public forum. The court also rejected the officials’ argument that their social media pages were not official channels for members of the public to communicate with the government. The Michigan case arose in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. City Manager James Freed posted information on his Facebook page, which described him as a “public figure,” about efforts the city was taking to deal with the public health crisis. One resident, Kevin Lindke, posted comments criticizing the city’s response, prompting Freed to block him. Freed says the Facebook page, which is no longer active, was a personal page. He used it to share pictures of his family and comment on his daily activities, he added. In a June 2022 ruling, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding a lower court ruling, said Freed was not acting in his official capacity and therefore his Facebook activity did not constitute ""state action"" that could give rise to a lawsuit. The Supreme Court in 2021 threw out the similar lawsuit brought against Trump because at that point he had left office and the case was moot, meaning the legal question was left unresolved. At that point, Twitter had also banned Trump’s account, although the company’s new owner, Elon Musk, has since reversed course. In Trump’s case, courts ruled against the president, noting that he often used his Twitter account to make official announcements. Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote at the time that the case highlighted that “applying old doctrines to new digital platforms is rarely straightforward.” While in some ways Twitter could be seen as a public forum, in other ways it is a private space over which the company has broad power, Thomas noted, pointing out its decision to ban Trump.

TikTok users are demanding that their favorite musicians release sped-up songs,Sarah Kaufman,"April 22, 2023, 1:28 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"On TikTok, one of the latest music trends is speeding up popular songs. And now, fans are demanding that artists comply with their expectations for speedy sounds. In one recent controversy, Grammy-winning artist Kim Petras faced backlash from her fans after she teased her new song with Nicki Minaj, “Alone.” After she revealed a portion of the track that featured a slower beat, some fans revolted. “Mother please change the beat,” said one commenter. “Waittttt I thought I was gonna be throwin it this summer, not chillin,” said another. Hundreds of fans commented they wanted a faster-paced song. The demands from Petras’ fans are just one part of the sped-up song boom on the app. TikTok has seen an increasing number of ‘sped-up’ songs take off in the last year, according to a TikTok spokesperson. The hashtag #spedupsounds has amassed 14.8 billion views, and hundreds of accounts on TikTok have gained millions of followers from speeding up songs on their own and posting them to TikTok. Artists and labels are now leaning into the trend by releasing their own sped-up remixes of songs. The remixes will oftentimes see even more engagement than the original, according to the TikTok spokesperson. For example, In January, R&B star Miguel released an official sped-up version of his 2010 single, “Sure Thing,” which went viral on TikTok and made its way into the Billboard Top 20 at #15, over a decade after its release. Bad Friends, a dance-pop producer duo based in London, released their own version of Petras’ “Alone” just hours after backlash started to mount over the slow beat in the most recently released snippet. The duo posted it on their TikTok and immediately saw an influx of views and comments. The producers, Noah Tate and Hugo Shaw, said they came at their version of the song from their dance-pop background and a genuine love of the sample. Tate and Shaw knew that people would want to know what a Minaj verse sounded like on the sample, so they used an AI voice splitter website that allows users to isolate vocals from a song, Tate said. They took Minaj’s verse from her 2012 song “Whip It” and added it to their version of “Alone.” “There’s always going to be value in changing the tempo or pitch of a song,” Tate said. “People also love mixing different songs, even if they’ve heard the original.” “From a musician’s point of view, I think speeding up songs and pitching them up, you can hear them in a different light and get a different feeling out of them,” Tate said. Music producer xxtristanxo has gained 3.5 million followers on TikTok and 5.4 million monthly listeners on Spotify creating sped-up versions of songs and mashups, some of which have over 20 million streams on Spotify. The 21-year-old musician from Raleigh, North Carolina, has signed multiple deals with big name artists and their record labels who have officially released his sped-up versions of their songs. In February, xxtristanxo released an official remix of “Die for You” with The Weeknd through the record labels XO and Republic Records. It has over 8 million streams on Spotify. “I think people like hearing their favorite songs in different contexts,” xxtristanxo said. “If you went to a club, you’d go to hear a remix. If you went to a concert, you’d hear a live version, or a different rendition. Sped-up songs, mashups and slowed versions are really TikTok’s way of giving that to people.” The sped-up sound has musical roots going back to the mid 2000s, when it originated as a subgenre called Nightcore. Nightcore amassed a cult-like following starting around 2008, when musicians started posting their sped-up remixes on YouTube and often mixed them with an anime visual to boost engagement. The tracks are no longer colloquially known as Nightcore and they are no longer a subgenre, but rather a full-blown trend. The sped-up sound’s newfound prevalence could be a sign of a new conceptualization of content creation among the younger generation, said Tatiana Cirisano, music industry analyst and consultant at MiDIA Research, a U.K.-based research company that studies entertainment trends. “TikTok is one of the first mainstream apps where users are encouraged to put their own spin on their favorite song. They are interested in any way you can actively participate in the thing you’re a fan of and add to it,” she said. Bad Friends’ remix is just one example of users on TikTok adding their own spin on something they love. “Tiktok has been flipping the equation of who is making decisions in music. Sped-up songs are just one part of that,” Cirisano said. The platform “makes songs more memeable, it makes them almost funny sometimes.” Sped-up songs are also a part of a larger trend of people speeding up media to fit in as much content as possible into a shorter amount of time, including podcasts and YouTube videos, said Gloria Mark, chancellor’s professor at University of California, Irvine who has studied attention spans for over 20 years. Now that several platforms have the option for users to speed up their media, there is a new mentality of having more personal autonomy to adjust media to the speed of their liking, Mark said. “People can comprehend things at a faster speed, and because they can, they will do it. Because we have this culture where we want to try to accomplish as much as we can, fit as much as we can, do as much as we can into our day, and we do it by speeding up media,” Mark said. Jovynn, a DJ who has 10.4 million followers on TikTok from posting her sped-up remixes, said that shortening attention spans are a part of why sped-up songs have become so widespread. “Since TikTok’s a fast-paced app, the audience has a shorter attention span on there, and the only way to allow listeners to stick through the best parts of a song is to speed up the BPM [beats per minute] of a track,” she said.

Fake accounts pop up on Twitter following  legacy blue check removals,Daysia Tolentino,"April 21, 2023, 4:09 PM UTC / Updated April 21, 2023, 5:04 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"As Twitter began removing legacy verification badges Thursday, impersonators quickly took advantage of the situation by creating parody accounts for public figures, including celebrities and politicians. After their real accounts lost their blue check marks, impersonator accounts quickly emerged for users such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling, the City of New York, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Twitch streamer Hasan Piker and former Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. As of Friday morning, Twitter accounts impersonating Clinton, Rowling, New York and Piker were suspended. Accounts with verified blue check marks had been awarded the badges by the company’s previous leadership to identify accounts belonging to public organizations and high-profile users. The platform announced it would wind down the system officially Thursday. The check marks, which were free, are now available through Twitter Blue — a subscription service the company launched last year. Some public figures have kept their badges, courtesy of Twitter owner Elon Musk, while many more lost verification, adding to confusion around the real accounts of its high-profile users. Programmer Travis Brown tweeted that only 28 legacy verified accounts joined Twitter Blue following Thursday’s purge. Brown said his findings are based off data pulled from the company's API, which offers developers access to the platform's data. The removal of the check marks has already prompted fears that Twitter users will have one less tool to distinguish known sources from impersonators or hoaxes. “I can practically *feel* the coming uptick in scamming,” one user wrote, attaching photos of now-unverified official government accounts. Some have also worried about how the lack of verification will have an impact on real-time disaster response. ""This seems like it could be a problem, particularly during an emergency,"" one user wrote, taking a screenshot of an exchange between the New York City Government account and an account parodying it. Twitter has struggled to manage impersonators on the platform since introducing paid verification through its Twitter Blue program in November. NBA player LeBron James and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani were among the public figures to be impersonated at the time. The incident caused Twitter to temporarily pull its paid verification feature. In November, Musk tweeted that “any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying ‘parody’ will be permanently suspended.” Twitter’s policy states that users “may not misappropriate the identity of individuals, groups, or organizations or use a fake identity to deceive others.” The platform now describes verified accounts as “verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number.” "
Elon Musk’s Twitter drops government-funded media labels,Associated Press,"April 21, 2023, 12:13 PM UTC",Social Media,"Twitter has removed labels describing global media organizations as government-funded or state-affiliated, a move that comes after the Elon Musk-owned platform started stripping blue verification checkmarks from accounts that don’t pay a monthly fee. Among those no longer labeled was NPR in the U.S., which announced last week that it would stop using Twitter after its main account was designated state-affiliated media, a term also used to identify media outlets controlled or heavily influenced by authoritarian governments, such as Russia and China. Twitter later changed the label to “government-funded media,” but NPR — which relies on the government for a tiny fraction of its funding — said it was still misleading. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and Swedish public radio made similar decisions to quit tweeting. CBC’s government-funded label vanished Friday, along with the state-affiliated tags on media accounts including Sputnik and RT in Russia and Xinhua in China. Many of Twitter’s high-profile users on Thursday lost the blue checks that helped verify their identity and distinguish them from impostors. Twitter had about 300,000 verified users under the original blue-check system — many of them journalists, athletes and public figures. The checks used to mean the account was verified by Twitter to be who it says it is. High-profile users who lost their blue checks Thursday included Beyoncé, Pope Francis, Oprah Winfrey and former President Donald Trump. The costs of keeping the marks range from $8 a month for individual web users to a starting price of $1,000 monthly to verify an organization, plus $50 monthly for each affiliate or employee account. Twitter does not verify the individual accounts, as was the case with the previous blue check doled out during the platform’s pre-Musk administration. Celebrity users, from basketball star LeBron James to author Stephen King and Star Trek’s William Shatner, have balked at joining — although on Thursday, all three had blue checks indicating that the account paid for verification. King, for one, said he hadn’t paid. “My Twitter account says I’ve subscribed to Twitter Blue. I haven’t. My Twitter account says I’ve given a phone number. I haven’t,” King tweeted Thursday. “Just so you know.” In a reply to King’s tweet, Musk said “You’re welcome namaste” and in another tweet he said he’s “paying for a few personally.” He later tweeted he was just paying for King, Shatner and James. Singer Dionne Warwick tweeted earlier in the week that the site’s verification system “is an absolute mess.” “The way Twitter is going anyone could be me now,” Warwick said. She had earlier vowed not to pay for Twitter Blue, saying the monthly fee “could (and will) be going toward my extra hot lattes.” On Thursday, Warwick lost her blue check (which is actually a white check mark in a blue background). For users who still had a blue check Thursday, a popup message indicated that the account “is verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number.” Verifying a phone number simply means that the person has a phone number and they verified that they have access to it — it does not confirm the person’s identity. It wasn’t just celebrities and journalists who lost their blue checks Thursday. Many government agencies, nonprofits and public-service accounts around the world found themselves no longer verified, raising concerns that Twitter could lose its status as a platform for getting accurate, up-to-date information from authentic sources, including in emergencies. While Twitter offers gold checks for “verified organizations” and gray checks for government organizations and their affiliates, it’s not clear how the platform doles these out. The official Twitter account of the New York City government, which earlier had a blue check, tweeted on Thursday that “This is an authentic Twitter account representing the New York City Government This is the only account for @NYCGov run by New York City government” in an attempt to clear up confusion. A newly created spoof account with 36 followers (also without a blue check), disagreed: “No, you’re not. THIS account is the only authentic Twitter account representing and run by the New York City Government.” Soon, another spoof account — purporting to be Pope Francis — weighed in too: “By the authority vested in me, Pope Francis, I declare @NYC_GOVERNMENT the official New York City Government. Peace be with you.” Fewer than 5% of legacy verified accounts appear to have paid to join Twitter Blue as of Thursday, according to an analysis by Travis Brown, a Berlin-based developer of software for tracking social media. Musk’s move has riled up some high-profile users and pleased some right-wing figures and Musk fans who thought the marks were unfair. But it is not an obvious money-maker for the social media platform that has long relied on advertising for most of its revenue. Digital intelligence platform Similarweb analyzed how many people signed up for Twitter Blue on their desktop computers and only detected 116,000 confirmed sign-ups last month, which at $8 or $11 per month does not represent a major revenue stream. The analysis did not count accounts bought via mobile apps. After buying San Francisco-based Twitter for $44 billion in October, Musk has been trying to boost the struggling platform’s revenue by pushing more people to pay for a premium subscription. But his move also reflects his assertion that the blue verification marks have become an undeserved or “corrupt” status symbol for elite personalities, news reporters and others granted verification for free by Twitter’s previous leadership. Twitter began tagging profiles with a blue check mark starting about 14 years ago. Along with shielding celebrities from impersonators, one of the main reasons was to provide an extra tool to curb misinformation coming from accounts impersonating people. Most “legacy blue checks,” including the accounts of politicians, activists and people who suddenly find themselves in the news, as well as little-known journalists at small publications around the globe, are not household names. One of Musk’s first product moves after taking over Twitter was to launch a service granting blue checks to anyone willing to pay $8 a month. But it was quickly inundated by impostor accounts, including those impersonating Nintendo, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Musk’s businesses Tesla and SpaceX, so Twitter had to temporarily suspend the service days after its launch. The relaunched service costs $8 a month for web users and $11 a month for users of its iPhone or Android apps. Subscribers are supposed to see fewer ads, be able to post longer videos and have their tweets featured more prominently. "
Twitter begins removing legacy verified check marks,David Ingram,"April 20, 2023, 6:26 PM UTC / Updated April 21, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",Social Media,"It's the end of an era on Twitter. Many users said Thursday they had lost their verified blue check marks, posting screenshots of their profiles sans verification. Accounts with verified blue check marks had been awarded the badges by the company's previous leadership to identify accounts belonging to public organizations and high-profile users. The platform had initially said it would wind down the system on April 1. But the date passed and nothing happened. Then, last week, CEO Elon Musk announced a new date of April 20. As of early Thursday afternoon, celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian had lost their check marks. Prominent TV personalities such as CNN’s Christiane Amanpour and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow lost theirs, as well. Public figures relating to all sectors of society, from Bill Gates to Pope Francis, also lost their checks. Congressional representatives appear to still have the gray government check mark on their official accounts, while some — such as Reps. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., Brian Mast, R-Fla., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. — have lost verification on their personal accounts. Others, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., still have the blue checks on their personal accounts. As the removal process was underway Thursday, some users reported confusing glitches — they saw their blue check marks disappear, then reappear, only to disappear once again. But most users whose check marks were removed were ready to say goodbye. Actor Halle Berry posted a meme to commemorate the loss of her check mark. ""#BlueCheckMark,"" ""Twitter Blue"" and ""Verified"" trended on the platform in the U.S., with new tweets cropping up nearly every minute. Twitter now describes verified accounts as “verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number.” But as some legacy verified profiles continue to hold on to their check marks, the new language has prompted speculation that some celebrities have paid for Twitter Blue. Some who have noticed the change on their profiles, including author Stephen King, have begun to tweet disclaimers stating that they did not, in fact, pay to keep their badges. In a response to a tweet that reported ""some celebrities have been offered a complimentary Twitter Blue subscription on behalf of Musk,"" the CEO responded that he's ""paying for a few personally."" Musk later confirmed that he was paying for the verification of actor William Shatner, NBA star LeBron James and King. As of Thursday evening, previously verified accounts still appear in search results that specify “filter:verified.” The removal of the check marks is the latest step by Musk to remake Twitter since he bought it in October for $44 billion, casting himself as the steward of an essential public forum while driving off some of the well-known people who used it. The move has already prompted fears that Twitter users will have one less tool to distinguish known sources from impersonators or hoaxes. The check marks, which were free, are now available through Twitter Blue — a subscription service the company launched last year. The $8-per-month service, which also allows users to edit and undo tweets, was quickly pulled after impersonators flourished. It was relaunched in December. Verification badges are removed through a mostly manual process, and the system that powers that process is prone to breaking, The Washington Post reported. NBC News has not verified that reporting. Twitter first began adding verification labels to certain accounts in 2009 after someone on the service impersonated baseball manager Tony La Russa and La Russa sued the company. The blue badges reassured some people that at least some of what they saw on Twitter came from a credible or at least well-known source, such as a government agency, news organization, corporation, entertainer or athlete. But over time, who was granted verification became an increasing source of conflict and envy. The term “blue checks” became internet slang for a class of elites. Twitter froze the program for four years to consider changes before resuming it in 2021, largely as it had been. Musk has said that he wanted to see changes to the check marks since last April, even before he offered to buy Twitter. On Wednesday and Thursday, many users prepared for the check's removal. ""please connect w/ me elsewhere… insta MONICA_LEWINSKY and most of the other new places that have real verification under my name,"" Monica Lewinsky tweeted. ""Screenshot this in case it’s not there tomorrow,"" “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill wrote, adding a blue check mark emoji. ""Goodbye, blue check. I will pathetically seek validation from mere friends and loved ones,"" wrote another Twitter user. "
TikTok CEO gives first public interview since congressional hearing,Daysia Tolentino,"April 20, 2023, 11:57 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew doubled down on the platform's commitment to user safety and data security at the TED2023 conference Thursday. Throughout the event in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chew — who was interviewed by Chris Anderson, the head of TED — re-emphasized TikTok's commitment to address concerns raised by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, specifically the issues of child safety, data security and China's influence on the app. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the popular video app in the U.S. because of security concerns about its Chinese owners. Critics argue that TikTok is a national security threat given its ability to collect data on its users, some noting that much of the user base is teens and young adults. Last week, Montana legislators passed a bill to block new downloads of TikTok in the state, the most significant action yet by a state yet against the app. The Q&A, Chew's first public interview since he addressed lawmakers, was the latest part of his charm offensive efforts amid calls for a congressional crackdown on TikTok. Asked by Anderson whether he could directly say TikTok will not allow Chinese government interference in U.S. elections, Chew said, “We are building all the tools to prevent any of these actions from happening."" ""And I’m very confident that with an unprecedented amount of transparency that we’re giving on the platform, we can reduce this risk to as close to as zero as possible,"" he added. Chew said the company is ""very, very far along"" with Project Texas, its plan to store U.S. data on American soil in partnership with the Texas-based cloud company Oracle. ""Today, by default, all new U.S. data is already stored in the Oracle Cloud infrastructure,"" Chew said. ""So it's in this protected U.S. environment that we talked about in the United States. We still have some legacy data to delete in our own servers in Virginia and in Singapore."" He said deleting legacy data is a ""big engineering effort"" but should be completed by the end of the year. Anderson also questioned Chew about TikTok's ability to protect children. Bloomberg News reported Thursday that TikTok’s algorithm pushes suicide to vulnerable kids. Chew did not address the app’s impact on teen mental health but reiterated its restrictions for underage users and its community guidelines to prevent harmful content. He also touched on age verification. In addition to requiring users to share their ages upon signing up, Chew said, TikTok has tools that scan people’s public profiles and “try and match what the age that you said with the video that you just posted.” "
China's crackdown on deepfakes doesn't stop its apps from finding U.S. audience,Kat Tenbarge,"April 20, 2023, 7:42 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"China is cracking down on deepfakes at home while profiting from them abroad. Deepfake apps from China-based developers have been downloaded millions of times in the U.S. and remain available on app stores even after China instituted strict laws this year regulating deepfake videos on its own internet. The apps allow Chinese developers to profit from data and dollars brought in through America’s largely unregulated tech market, while U.S. lawmakers have focused on other targets, such as TikTok. That scrutiny has not been extended to other China-based apps, such as the online marketplaces Shein and Temu, which are popular in the U.S. and other parts of the world. Deepfakes are manipulated media, often created with artificial intelligence technology, in which faces, appearances and voices have been altered. The technology has improved in recent years and has been used to make viral videos, some to warn about the technology’s ability to create misinformation. But more than anything else, deepfake technology has fueled an online economy centered on creating fake pornography. Sensity, an Amsterdam-based company that detects and monitors AI-developed synthetic media for industries like banking and fintech, found that 96% of deepfakes are sexually explicit and feature women who did not consent to their creation. An NBC News review of free deepfake apps on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play store found more than 17 deepfake apps available to download from companies based all over the world, including Russia, Ukraine, the U.K., the U.S., Italy and China. Some of the apps reviewed by NBC News, such as the popular Cyprus-based FaceApp and China-based Facee, do not offer features that allow the production of pornographic videos. Such apps are meant to alter images of faces with preset filters. But other apps specifically market their abilities to create nonconsensual deepfake pornography. One of the China-based apps, FaceMagic, is running sexually explicit ads that say “Make deepfake porn in a sec” on the most popular deepfake porn website, according to a review of the advertisements by NBC News. It has been downloaded more than 2.4 million times since May 2021, according to data from Apptopia, a company that tracks the app market. Another China-based deepfake app, FaceMega, was recently removed from the Apple and Google app stores after NBC News found that it ran more than 260 ads on Facebook depicting Emma Watson’s likeness in a sexually suggestive nature. Those apps would almost certainly run afoul of China’s new deepfake rules, which went into effect in January. The rules prohibit creating deepfakes without the consent of the people whose likenesses are being manipulated, and they require labeling deepfakes as AI-generated. The U.S. has no such federal laws, although some states impose civil penalties for creating nonconsensual porn and deepfakes that depict political disinformation. Some privacy activists have pushed for new rules around deepfakes, but most politicians have instead focused on TikTok. “In the same way that we are well behind on the regulation of privacy, I think we’re still very much at the early stages of determining what regulation we should have around deepfakes,” said Samir Jain, the director of policy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and free expression. Concerns about foreign access to U.S. user data through apps have coalesced in recent years around China and TikTok. Critics of TikTok have argued that it poses a particularly urgent security threat, because China could force it to divulge data about its U.S. users. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew told a congressional hearing last month that ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent, was a private company and not controlled by the Chinese government. “TikTok has never shared, or received a request to share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government,” he said in prepared remarks. “Nor would TikTok honor such a request if one were ever made.” China, which says it would “firmly oppose” any forced sale of TikTok in the U.S., says it takes data privacy and security very seriously and that the U.S. has provided no evidence that TikTok threatens its national security. “The Chinese government has never asked and will never ask any company or individual to collect or provide data, information or intelligence located abroad against local laws,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said last month. An request for comment sent to the Chinese embassing in the U.S. was not answered. Other countries have taken broad steps to address data privacy issues, as well as concerns about the spread of deepfakes. The European Union has strict privacy rules that it has enforced against many major tech companies, including Amazon, Meta and Google. The E.U. also created rules meant to force major tech platforms to limit the spread of deepfakes. None have gone as far as China with its recent deepfake rules. “China as a hub for AI development is increasingly seeking to export its own vision of what AI governance means,” said Michael Karanicolas, the executive director of the UCLA Institute for Technology Law & Policy. “For all the focus on Chinese apps’ disrupting the American economy, China is saying we need rules around this stuff.” Mary Anne Franks, a law professor and the president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit group that combats nonconsensual porn, said that the commercial model for nearly every app operating in the U.S. involves selling user data and that those legal vulnerabilities overlap with the legal gray area that allows the deepfake economy to flourish. Deepfake porn websites are a recently growing phenomenon, with search interest trending historically high early this year. “If the actual powers that be had paid attention to this crisis and anticipated that one day the technology wasn’t going to be crude and wasn’t going to be distinguishable, we wouldn’t be in this position,” Franks said. Franks said there are legitimate complaints about TikTok, as there are for many other apps. Deepfake apps also collect user data, which can be shared and sold with anyone. That information, however, is not particularly hard to find. And banning TikTok would not change much. “If China is interested in that information, they can buy it freely on the secondary market,” Karanicolas said. “You can ban an app, but it doesn’t really affect the broader problem.” "
BuzzFeed News is shutting down,Rob Wile,"April 20, 2023, 3:22 PM UTC",Business News,"BuzzFeed News is shutting down. In an email to staff shared with NBC News, BuzzFeed Inc. CEO and co-founder Jonah Peretti said the move was part of a 15% workforce reduction across a number of teams. ""While layoffs are occurring across nearly every division, we’ve determined that the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization,"" he wrote. Peretti said he had overinvested in BuzzFeed News ""because I love their work and mission so much."" ""This made me slow to accept that the big platforms wouldn’t provide the distribution or financial support required to support premium, free journalism purpose-built for social media,"" he wrote. He added that he had failed to ""hold the company to higher standards for profitability"" to give it a buffer during downturns. Moving forward, BuzzFeed will have a lone news brand, HuffPost, which BuzzFeed acquired in 2020 and which Peretti said ""is profitable, with a loyal direct front page audience."" Affected BuzzFeed News staffers will have an opportunity to apply for ""a number of select roles"" at HuffPost and BuzzFeed.com. Peretti said he planned to engage with the News Guild union about the cost reduction plans and what they would mean for affected union members. BuzzFeed News launched in earnest at the outset of 2012 after it named longtime New York City political reporter Ben Smith as its editor-in-chief. In 2021, the news organization won a Pulitzer Prize for a series exposing China’s mass detention of Muslims. That same year, it was also named a Pulitzer finalist — the second time it had received the honor. Later that year, BuzzFeed Inc. became a publicly traded company amid a global frenzy of reverse mergers, many of which have since lost significant value. In BuzzFeed's case, it never traded above its initial public offering price of about $10. Following the announcement Thursday, shares in the company fell another 20%, to about $0.72. Comcast, the parent company of NBC News, owns a minority stake in BuzzFeed Inc. BuzzFeed's announcement came the same day the digital news media company Insider said it would shed 10% of its workforce. The Daily Beast was first to report the Insider layoffs. The job cuts reflect a broader downturn in the media and tech industries, as the breakneck growth seen in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic has begun to rapidly fade amid a slowing economy. Other digital platforms that have announced headcount reductions include ESPN, Spotify, Yahoo and Vimeo. MSNBC's Hayes Brown contributed reporting. "
CFPB employee sent hundreds of thousands of consumers' data to personal email account,Reuters,"April 20, 2023, 12:28 PM UTC",Politics News,"WASHINGTON — A former employee at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sent confidential records relating to hundreds of thousands of consumers and several financial institutions to their personal email account, the agency said on Wednesday. The bureau found personally identifiable information relating to customers of seven institutions that had been forwarded by a staffer who is no longer employed at the CFPB, it said in a statement. The person also accessed information including names and transaction-specific account numbers related to about 256,000 consumer accounts at a single institution, it added. The CFPB did not identify the former employee or the institutions involved. A spokesperson for the CFPB said the incident was “completely unacceptable,” adding it had been referred to the bureau’s internal watchdog. The incident was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

How to apply for your share of Facebook's $725 million settlement in privacy suit,"Rohan Goswami, CNBC","April 19, 2023, 7:14 PM UTC",News,"Facebook users have until August to claim their share of a $725 million class-action settlement of a lawsuit alleging privacy violations by the social media company, a new website reveals. The lawsuit was prompted in 2018 after Facebook disclosed that the information of 87 million users was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. People who had an active U.S. Facebook account between May 2007 and December 2022 have until Aug. 25 to enter a claim. Individual settlement payments haven’t yet been established because payouts depend on how many users submit claims and how long each user maintained a Facebook account. Cambridge Analytica was a British political consultancy used by the presidential campaign of Donald Trump and by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, among others. The breach forced Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress and to take out full-page ads where he apologized for the missteps. “I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. We’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” Zuckerberg said. Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021 and settled the class-action suit the following year. Meta did not admit wrongdoing. “We pursued a settlement as it’s in the best interest of our community and shareholders,” a company spokesperson said at the time. A spokesperson for Meta did not offer additional comment. Facebook users can make a claim by visiting Facebookuserprivacysettlement.com and entering their name, address, email address, and confirming they lived in the U.S. and were active on Facebook between the aforementioned dates.

Europe approves its $47 billion answer to Biden’s CHIPS Act,"Ryan Browne, CNBC","April 19, 2023, 2:02 PM UTC",Tech News,"The European Union has agreed a landmark plan to boost its chip industry. The initiative, dubbed the European Chips Act, seeks to help the bloc compete with the U.S. and Asia on tech, and secure control over a critical bit of technology behind the world’s electronics products and devices. The EU Parliament and 27 member states reached a deal on the legislation on Tuesday. In a statement, they said the new rules would aim to double the EU’s global market share in semiconductors from 10% to 20% by 2030. “This agreement is of utmost importance for the green and digital transition while securing the EU’s resilience in turbulent times,” Ebba Busch, the Swedish energy minister, said Tuesday. “The new rules represent a real revolution for Europe in the key sector of semiconductors.” The European Chips Act is a massive, 43 billion-euro ($47 billion) package of public and private investments that aims to secure its supply chains, avert shortages of semiconductors in the future, and promote investment into the industry. The Chips Act has three main aims: The EU Chips Act will invest 6.2 billion euros to promote industrialization of innovative technologies, establish competence centers for skill development, and ensure access to finance, the European Commission, the E.U.’s executive arm, said in a statement. It will also incentivize investments in manufacturing facilities and provide a framework for integrated production facilities and open EU foundries for security of supply. Member states will also coordinate to monitor supply and forecast any shortages, the commission said. Since first announcing the plan last year, the EU has already attracted between 90 billion and 100 billion euros of public and private commitments for industrial deployment. Chips are effectively the brains of electronic devices. They’re used in everything from smartphones to gaming consoles — but also products you wouldn’t expect them in, like cars and refrigerators. Semiconductors, and the mainly East Asia-based supply chain behind them, have become a thorny issue for world governments after a global shortage led to supply problems for major automakers and electronics manufacturers. The Covid-19 pandemic exposed an overreliance on manufacturers from Taiwan and China for semiconductor components. That dependency has become fraught with tensions between China and Taiwan on the rise. TSMC, the Taiwanese semiconductor giant, is by far the largest producer of microchips. Its chipmaking prowess is the envy of many developed Western nations, which are taking measures to boost domestic production of chips. Europe has been seeking to control more of its supply chain to reduce its reliance on foreign market players. The move is part of a push from the EU to achieve “digital sovereignty,” which refers to the idea that they have more control over critical technologies. “A swift implementation of today’s agreement will transform; our dependency into market leadership; our vulnerability into sovereignty; our expenditure into investment,” Busch said. “The Chips act puts Europe in the first line of cutting-edge technologies which are essential for our green and digital transitions.” At the same time, the bloc has realized it can’t achieve this production ramp up alone — there are no European firms that can manufacture leading-edge chips. The EU wants to attract funding from foreign companies into its market. U.S. chipmaking giant Intel is among the companies upping its investments in Europe, and has committed over 33 billion euros to boost chipmaking across the EU. In the U.K., chip firms have been threatening to leave the U.K. due to a lack of similar support from the government. Europe is home to a titan in the semiconductor space — Dutch firm ASML. ASML’s extreme ultraviolet lithography machines are used to etch microscopic features into silicon wafers. But the company doesn’t produce its own chips. Officials want more semiconductors to be developed within Europe, so they don’t face the risk of a big shortage, or threats to national security. "
Meta begins another round of layoffs as Zuckerberg’s ‘year of efficiency’ continues,"Jonathan Vanian, CNBC","April 19, 2023, 1:49 PM UTC",Tech News,"As part of Meta’s latest round of job cuts announced in March, the company on Wednesday started laying off employees in technical roles. Employees with backgrounds in technical areas like user experience, software engineering, graphics programming and other roles announced on LinkedIn that they had been let go by the company on Wednesday morning. A Meta spokesperson confirmed to CNBC the cuts had started. One employee impacted by the layoffs told CNBC Wednesday’s layoffs also hit product-facing teams and that Meta plans to cut business-facing roles, such as finance, legal and HR, beginning in May. The employee, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said Meta suggested tech teams who weren’t impacted by Wednesday’s cuts may also be included in layoffs next month. LinkedIn posts indicated that multiple people who worked as gameplay programmers were also affected by the layoffs. Gameplay engineers work on virtual- and augmented-reality products, according to a Meta job listing. “I woke up this morning to the unfortunate news that I was one of the many laid-off from Meta today,” a Facebook business program manager wrote on Linkedin. With ad revenue slumping last year and its stock price in free fall, Facebook’s parent announced its first round of layoffs in November, affecting some 11,000 workers. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg then declared 2023 the “year of efficiency,” and proceeded toward a plan of an additional 10,000 job cuts in March, resulting in restructuring costs of between $3 billion and $5 billion. As Zuckerberg said at the time, the new round of April layoffs targets technical workers. Zuckerberg said cuts in the business groups would take place in late May. Wall Street has applauded the downsizing. Meta shares have soared 81% this year after losing about two-thirds of their value last year. Revenue has declined for three straight quarters, and analysts are projecting another quarterly sales drop when Meta reports its first-quarter earnings next week. The company’s previous guidance called for sales of between $26 billion and $28.5 billion, which means the streak of revenue drops could end if Meta reaches the top end of the range. While its core business is mired in an online ad slump, Meta is spending billions of dollars a quarter developing technology for the metaverse, representing a huge and risky bet on a nascent market that’s yet to crack the mainstream. Last quarter, Meta’s Reality Labs unit, tasked with building the metaverse, recorded a $4.28 billion operating loss, bringing the unit’s total losses for 2022 to $13.72 billion. "
"Russian-aligned cyber groups are seeking to target Western infrastructure, U.K. says",Dan De Luce,"April 18, 2023, 11:02 PM UTC / Updated April 19, 2023, 10:54 AM UTC",War in Ukraine,"BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Russian-aligned cyber groups outside Moscow’s formal control represent a growing threat and are looking to target critical infrastructure in the West, according to Britain’s cybersecurity agency. Motivated more by ideology than by money, the groups, which surfaced after Russia invaded Ukraine, pose a potential risk to crucial infrastructure systems in Western countries, especially those that are “poorly protected,” the U.K. National Cyber Security Center, or NCSC, said in an alert issued Wednesday local time. “Although these groups can align to Russia’s perceived interests, they are often not subject to formal state control, and so their actions are less constrained and their targeting broader than traditional cyber crime actors,” the NCSC alert said. “This makes them less predictable.” The groups often focus on denial-of-service attacks, defacing websites and spreading misinformation, according to the alert. But some “have stated a desire to achieve a more disruptive and destructive impact against Western critical national infrastructure, including in the U.K.,” it said. Without outside assistance, it is unlikely that the groups “have the capability to deliberately cause a destructive, rather than disruptive, impact in the short term,” the cybersecurity center said. But the groups may become more effective over time, and the NCSC recommends that organizations “act now to manage the risk against successful future attacks.” British Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Dowden cited the cybersecurity alert in a speech Wednesday and urged companies to take necessary precautions. “Disclosing this threat is not something we do lightly,” Dowden said at a U.K. cyber security conference in Belfast. “But we believe it is necessary … if we want these companies to understand the current risk they face and take action to defend themselves and the country.” Dowden, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the most senior Cabinet member after the prime minister, compared the Russian-linked hackers to the mercenary outfit Wagner Group, which has played a prominent role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Dowden called the hackers “the cyber equivalent of the Wagner group.” He said the government had revealed intelligence about the threat because it was determined not to allow the hackers “to stay in the shadows.” Lindy Cameron, the CEO of the National Cyber Security Center, which is part of Britain’s cyber and intelligence agency GCHQ, said Wednesday that there is increased concern about hackers planning to strike U.K. infrastructure but did not elaborate. Asked about whether she has seen attempts to target the U.K., she told BBC Radio’s “Today” show: “We’re seeing some indication of that, but I wouldn’t want to go into further detail.” Ukraine has accused Russia of launching thousands of cyberattacks against its infrastructure since the February 2022 invasion, but experts say Moscow has not staged similar cyber offensives against NATO countries. Some experts warn Russia has most likely penetrated sensitive networks and could order damaging cyberattacks if it decides to widen the war beyond Ukraine. A leaked U.S. intelligence assessment warned that Russian hacktivists broke into a Canadian gas infrastructure company this year and have received directions from Russian intelligence, NBC News has reported. The assessment was part of a trove of classified Defense Department documents that surfaced on social media and were obtained by news organizations. NBC News could not independently confirm the intelligence assessment. The hacktivists, a Russian-speaking group called Zarya, broke into the computer network of an unnamed Canadian gas distribution facility in February and sent Russia’s FSB intelligence agency screenshots of what it claimed were controls “to increase valve pressure, disable alarms, and initiate an emergency operation [that] would cause an explosion,” the U.S. assessment says. “If Zarya succeeded, it would mark the first time the IC has observed a pro-Russia hacking group execute a disruptive attack against Western industrial control systems,” the assessment says, using an abbreviation for the intelligence community. No such disaster appears to have happened. But the assessment illustrates both how the U.S. worries about destructive hacks against Western energy infrastructure and how Russian intelligence can rely on domestic hackers to work for it. "
Special master investigation into Fox News ends after Dominion settlement,Daniel Arkin,"April 18, 2023, 7:31 PM UTC / Updated April 19, 2023, 2:03 AM UTC",Dominion v. Fox News,"The lawyer appointed as special master in the Fox News defamation trial will no longer investigate the company now that it has settled with Dominion Voting Systems for nearly $800 million, a source familiar with the situation said. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis appointed Delaware litigator John A. Elzufon on Tuesday morning to investigate whether Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corp., had ""complied with their discovery obligations"" ahead of the trial. The $787.5 million settlement reached Tuesday afternoon headed off what would have been one of the most explosive American media trials in decades, and it initially raised the question of whether Elzufon's work would proceed. The source familiar with the matter said Tuesday night that the special master's investigation will not move forward. Dominion declined to comment, and Fox did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Elzufon had been given a wide investigative berth. In a four-page filing Tuesday morning, Davis said that Elzufon could request depositions with whomever he wished and that Fox must pay the associated costs. Davis last week sanctioned Fox for not having turned over evidence in a timely fashion. The evidence in question included audio recordings of Rudy Giuliani appearing to concede to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo that he did not have proof of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The recordings were turned over by Abby Grossberg, a former Fox News producer who is suing the network, alleging in part that she was harassed. Fox News has said Grossberg's legal claims are ""unmeritorious."" In one of the recordings, from November 2020, Bartiromo asks Giuliani for evidence of fraud by Dominion, and he replies, “That’s a little harder to tell you — it’s being analyzed right now.” Giuliani also says he “can’t prove” that Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House, had an interest in Dominion. In a second clip, from December 2020, a Trump official can be heard telling Fox News “there weren’t any physical issues with the [voting] machines” during inspections. In a statement Tuesday evening, Grossberg's lawyer, Gerry Filippatos, said in part that he was ""profoundly disappointed to have learned that the Court has apparently chosen to allow Fox News to abuse the discovery process and pillory Abby Grossberg's good character in open court without an adequate investigation into the unabashed misconduct of Fox News and its attorneys."" Dominion, a privately held company that makes voting equipment, sued Fox for airing false allegations of voter fraud after President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. It sought $1.6 billion in damages. Twelve jurors were seated before the court broke for lunch Tuesday. Then, after a lengthy afternoon delay, Davis returned to the bench and announced that the two sides had ""resolved their case."" "
Twitter quietly changes its hateful conduct policy to remove standing protections for its transgender users,Angela Yang,"April 18, 2023, 11:10 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Twitter sparked backlash this week after some users noticed it had quietly removed language in its hateful conduct policy that explicitly protected transgender people from online harassment. The social media platform had prohibited the targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender people since 2018. Some online noticed this month that the sentence had been plucked from Twitter’s section on slurs and tropes, while all other descriptions of policy violations remained intact. Archives captured by the Wayback Machine showed the previous version still existed April 7, the day Twitter announced it had updated its abuse and harassment policy to redefine “targeted harassment.” But by the next day, the line had disappeared. The advocacy group GLAAD condemned the move in a statement Tuesday, calling it the latest in a series of changes that have made the platform less safe for people and advertisers. “Twitter’s hateful conduct policy protected trans people from targeted misgendering and deadnaming for close to five years, and now they mysteriously removed it without a word,” GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. “This is unacceptable in any climate, and doubly unacceptable when you look at the barrage of disinformation and hate about trans people from right wing media personalities, politicians, and the extremists they bolster.” It’s unclear whether the change in language constitutes any change in the policy itself. As of Tuesday, Twitter’s report function still allows users to report a tweet for “misgendering or deadnaming” a person or a group of people. Twitter responded to a request for comment with the Pile of Poo emoji, an automated message it now sends as a reply to all media requests. Alejandra Caraballo, a civil rights attorney and clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic, said that Twitter has always been inconsistent in enforcing its content moderation rules Elon Musk’s takeover in October opened the floodgates to an even more unmanageable surge of hate speech. Regardless, she said, removing explicit language against targeting transgender users strips away the deterrent effect of having the policy in writing, even if the rules were to remain in place. And the impacts of hate speech on social media often bleed into real life. “It’s perpetuating this incentive to engage in the targeting of trans people, especially since it’s being favored by the algorithm because it’s creating outrage,” Caraballo said. “It’s relating to emotions of fear, anger and disgust, which are typically associated with better promotion by algorithms on social media sites because it increases engagement.” Online anti-transgender outrage against Dylan Mulvaney’s recent partnership with Bud Light, which played out largely on Twitter, incited bomb threats against Budweiser factories across the country. Transgender Twitter users have long expressed concern over Musk’s history of transphobic rhetoric and behavior, from tweeting in 2020 that “pronouns suck” to sharing an unfounded and homophobic conspiracy theory last year about Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., after he was attacked in the couple’s home. Twitter also updated its list of consequences for users who break the rules. It now claims it makes offending tweets less visible using expanded limits on discoverability, including removing them from search results and home timelines. Twitter announced Monday it will begin labeling such tweets with a content warning: “Visibility limited: this Tweet may violate Twitter’s rules against Hateful Conduct.” Caraballo said that in her experience as a transgender woman on the platform, the effectiveness of Twitter’s content moderation policies was close to zero even before the policy language changed. She recalls having reported multiple instances of being intentionally misgendered or deadnamed and hearing that no violation had been found. The most recent change, she said, may embolden transphobic users to ramp up their activities even further. “People don’t feel safe,” she said. “A lot of people are making their exit plans to other platforms, and while there’s no perfect replacement for Twitter and what it does, for a lot of people, it’s just not worth it to be subjected to that kind of abuse.” "
Fox News and Dominion reach $787.5 million settlement in defamation lawsuit,Jane C. Timm,"April 18, 2023, 8:01 PM UTC / Updated April 18, 2023, 8:43 PM UTC",Dominion v. Fox News,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems reached a $787.5 million settlement agreement Tuesday afternoon, the parties announced, narrowly heading off a trial shortly after the jury was sworn in. “Fox has admitted to telling lies,” John Poulos, Dominion’s CEO, said at a news conference after the trial ended. Justin Nelson, lead attorney for Dominion, told NBC News he hopes the settlement will restore faith in elections. “This alone can’t do it, right? But this shows that there is accountability, that we showed that if you are caught lying, you will be held responsible,” he said. Absent from the settlement details shared with the public was an apology or any admission that the network had indeed defamed Dominion when it allowed baseless conspiracies to proliferate on air about the company's voting machines ""rigging""  2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. A statement from Fox about the agreement recognized the court's previous ruling that the claims Dominion had challenged in its defamation lawsuit were indeed without merit. ""We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,"" the Fox statement said. “This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.” When pressed, a spokesperson for Dominion said “an apology is about accountability, and today Dominion held Fox accountable.” Stephen Shackelford Jr., the attorney who had been expected to give opening statements for Dominion on Tuesday, said “money is accountability."" Rumors of settlement talks had been buzzing for days, particularly after the court said late Sunday it would delay the conclusion of jury selection and opening arguments to Tuesday morning. The deal ends a monthslong legal battle over whether the media company had defamed the voting machine maker when Fox broadcast election conspiracy theories in 2020. The resolution came in the eleventh hour, after the jury was in place and reporters and lawyers had waited for hours for opening statements to begin. ""The parties have resolved their case,"" Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said Tuesday afternoon, informing the jurors of the settlement. ""That means your service is done and I’m going to excuse you. Sorry about making you wait."" Dominion sued Fox News in 2021, demanding $1.6 billion in damages. It said the network defamed it when it broadcast baseless claims that it was tied to the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, that it paid kickbacks to politicians and that its machines “rigged” the 2020 presidential election by flipping millions of votes for Trump to Joe Biden. The settlement came after a bruising week for Fox News. During pretrial conference hearings, Davis sanctioned the network for withholding evidence, and admonished it for not being straightforward with him. He said he would allow Dominion to conduct an additional deposition with Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch at Fox’s expense. Davis also ruled that Fox lawyers could not use newsworthiness as a legal defense, limiting their possible trial strategies. On Tuesday, Davis also appointed a special master to investigate whether Fox had adequately complied with court-ordered discovery. That probe was ended by the settlement, too. Few defamation suits make it this far, but outside legal experts say the case — and the extraordinary claims and evidence fueling it — was unique. The settlement is a strong outcome for Dominion, those experts said, which won't have to wait years for a potential jury-awarded payout stuck in the appeals process. Not all settlement terms are disclosed, but experts say they believe Fox's payout to be among the biggest. ""This number is not small,"" said RonNell Andersen Jones, a professor at the University of Utah College of Law who specializes in the First Amendment. “It might be the biggest of its kind in history."" Juries are always a risk, especially in a politically divisive case, she added. ""While going to a jury based on 'presumed damages' and malice often results in tremendous damages, it’s still a crapshoot,""  Anthony Michael Glassman, a longtime media lawyer who has represented both news outlets and the subjects of stories, said in an email. A hefty settlement without a trial ""is the right way to go,"" he added. "
Netflix to bring down the curtain on its DVD-by-mail service,Associated Press,"April 18, 2023, 8:25 PM UTC",Tech News,"Netflix is poised to shut down the DVD-by-mail rental service that set the stage for its trailblazing video streaming service, ending an era that began a quarter century ago when delivering discs through the mail was considered a revolutionary concept. The DVD service, which still delivers films and TV shows in the red-and-white envelopes that once served as Netflix’s emblem, plans to mail its final discs on Sept. 29. Netflix ended last year with nearly 231 million worldwide subscribers to its video streaming service, but it stopped disclosing how many people still pay for DVD-by-mail delivery years ago as that part of its business steadily shrank. The DVD service generated $145.7 million in revenue last year, which translated into somewhere between 1.1 million and 1.3 million subscribers, based on the average prices paid by customers. Shortly before Netflix broke it off from video streaming in 2011, the DVD-by-mail service boasted more than 16 million subscribers. That number has steadily dwindled and the service’s eventual demise became apparent as the idea of waiting for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver entertainment became woefully outdated. But the DVD-by-mail service still has die-hard fans who continue to subscribe because they treasure finding obscure movies that are aren’t widely available on video streaming. Many subscribers still wax nostalgic about opening their mailbox and seeing the familiar red-and-white envelopes awaiting them instead of junk mail and a stack of bills. “Those iconic red envelopes changed the way people watched shows and movies at home — and they paved the way for the shift to streaming,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos wrote in a blog post about the DVD service’s forthcoming shutdown. The service’s history dates back to 1997 when Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph went to a post office in Santa Cruz, California, to mail a Patsy Cline compact disc to his friend and fellow co-founder Reed Hasting. Randolph, Netflix’s original CEO, wanted to test whether a disc could be delivered through the U.S. Postal Service without being damaged, hoping eventually to do the same thing with the still-new format that became the DVD. The Patsy Cline CD arrived at Hastings’ home unblemished, prompting the duo in 1998 to launch a DVD-by-mail rental website that they always knew would be supplanted by even more convenient technology. “It was planned obsolescence, but our bet was that it would take longer for it to happen than most people thought at the time,” Randolph said in an interview with The Associated Press last year across the street from the Santa Cruz post office where he mailed the Patsy Cline CD. Hastings replaced Randolph as Netflix’s CEO a few years after its inception, a job he didn’t relinquish until stepping down in January. With just a little over five months of life remaining, the DVD service has shipped more than 5 billion discs across the U.S. — the only country it ever operated. Its ending echoes the downfall of the thousands of Blockbuster video rental stores that closed because they couldn’t counter the threat posed by Netflix’s DVD-by-mail alternative. Even subscribers who remain loyal to the DVD service could see the end coming as they noticed the shrinking selection in a library that once boasted more than 100,000 titles. Some customers also have reported having to wait longer for discs to be delivered as Netflix closed dozens of DVD distribution centers with the shift to streaming. “Our goal has always been to provide the best service for our members but as the business continues to shrink that’s going to become increasingly difficult,” Sarandos acknowledged in his blog post. Netflix rebranded the rental service as DVD.com — a prosaic name that was settled upon after Hastings floated the idea of calling it Qwikster, an idea that was widely ridiculed. The DVD service has been operating from a non-descript office in Fremont, California, located about 20 miles from Netflix’s sleek campus in Los Gatos, California. "
"Some content creators are going viral, thanks to ChatGPT",Brahmjot Kaur,"April 18, 2023, 8:12 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Barry Enderwick, who is known to his 300,000 TikTok followers as SandwichesofHistory, has built a niche online by filming himself making sandwiches from different time periods and countries. Now, he’s creating “sandwiches of future history” — with help from AI. The content creator launched a series, “AI Friday,” that features him posting sandwich recipes generated by ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-driven chatbot that has captivated the internet’s attention since its release last year. At first, he wasn’t sure what the software would come up with. But his first sandwich included eggs, avocado and chocolate spread — a combination that he said was surprisingly delicious. He’s the latest creator to use the tool — which has been deemed controversial in some circles — as a way to make more distinct content for his followers. “I wanted something unique,” Enderwick, who has a background in digital marketing, said of how he came up with the idea. “So, I’d say, ‘write me an unusual sandwich recipe’ and that led to the sandwiches that I’ve gotten so far. … For me, the goal is to generate something that’s not totally available already but also not something that’s just beyond the pale.” ChatGPT has raised concerns over its rapid evolution and human-like responses. About 38% of Americans said they were more concerned than excited about more AI in their daily lives, according to a study from the Pew Research Center in December. Only 15% said they were more excited than concerned, according to the survey. But for some creators, fear isn’t on their minds just yet because integrating ChatGPT into online content has proven, at times, to be a recipe for viral success. Bryan Hartlett has gone viral for using ChatGPT to write scripted fan fiction about the television show “Gilmore Girls” on TikTok. His most popular video, which garnered over 1 million views, is a fictional phone call between high-society mother Emily Gilmore and daughter Lorelai Gilmore about saving a seat at an event in Stars Hollow, where Lorelai lives. In another TikTok, Stars Hollow resident Kirk complained to the local diner’s owner, Luke, over the price of certain items on the menu. Commenters were shocked by the accuracy of the scene, many questioning whether it really happened. Others expressed gratitude for new “Gilmore Girls” content, even if it was fan-made. Hartlett has a simple strategy when it comes to making the videos: He feeds detailed descriptions of the characters and desired scenes into ChatGPT and uses the dialogue written by the AI with photos and recorded voiceovers to bring the scene to life. “If you were to just type into ChatGPT ‘write me an original Friday night dinner scene for an episode of “Gilmore Girls,’ it will definitely spit out a conversation, but it’s only part of the way there,” he said. “It has the characters and the settings, but the humor isn’t quite there.” It took time to develop each character’s voice and understand how to create the same tone and fast-paced humor fans loved, Hartlett said. Eventually, he figured it out — and has since produced 14 AI-generated episodes. “It was a matter of giving it a little bit more instruction and saying things like, ‘this is a character description of Lorelai,’ ‘this is a character description of Emily,’ ‘this is how these two characters typically communicate,’ and things like that,” he said. “Then it just kept getting closer and closer. With some of the scenes that I’ve made so far, that’s all it took.” Tom McGovern, a singer-songwriter from New Jersey with over 380,000 followers on TikTok, also said curiosity drew him to the software. “Initially, I was like, ‘Let’s have some fun. Let’s see what it can do if I ask it to write something dumb,’” he said. “I asked ChatGPT to write me a song called ‘Sexy Bus.’ That’s it, no genre, no chord progression, nothing. Sure enough, it spit out some lyrics that I thought were funny.” He wrote music to accompany the lyrics and made his first video using artificial intelligence. McGovern chose to make his videos karaoke-style with lyrics on the screen along with a video of him performing the song. His AI-generated pub song, which has 1.6 million views, is one of his most popular videos on his account. “I wanted it to feel like the listener was able to read along as if ChatGPT was feeding them the lyrics in real time,” he said. “I edited it in a way that the lyrics flow with the song because I think that’s a fun way and as immersive as you can be in this format for the listener.” McGovern has since released three other songs, including an homage to chinchillas called “Sweet Chinchilla,” and a song about horses in the style of the rock band Creed. McGovern said that he understands the concerns around using ChatGPT but that he sees it as a tool rather than a replacement for people in different industries. “ChatGPT is a fun tool to write the lyrics,” he said. “But I’m the one that’s writing the chords, producing it, writing the melodies and singing it.” "
Viral AI-powered Drake and The Weeknd song is removed from streaming services,Daysia Tolentino,"April 18, 2023, 7:04 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"An AI-voiced rap song replicating the voices of the artists Drake and The Weeknd that went viral on Sunday had been taken down from streaming services as of Tuesday morning. The song, “heart on my sleeve,” was created by an anonymous musician who goes by ghostwriter. “Heart on my sleeve” features vocals that sound like Drake and The Weeknd as well as Metro Boomin’s signature producer tag. Clips of the song went viral on social media, with one Twitter upload of the song garnering 6.9 million views. In a now-deleted TikTok video, ghostwriter explained that AI was used to create the song but did not disclose what program was used. In a comment under the video, ghostwriter said that they wrote the song, then replaced their voice with Drake’s. Typically, a person can make an AI song like this by writing and recording a track, then use an AI model to replace their vocals with a popular artist’s voice. “i was a ghostwriter for years and got paid close to nothing just for major labels to profit. the future is here,” the artist wrote in another TikTok comment. Ghostwriter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did representatives for The Weeknd or Metro Boomin. A representative for Drake did not comment on the matter. Listeners were impressed by the AI models’ abilities to capture Drake and The Weeknd’s voices accurately. However, the production and existence of the song itself divided people. “This is scary lol … song is actually good,” one person tweeted. “His lyrics and song structure was trash, but impressive AI model,” another tweeted. “i think the new wave of ai music is cool but i don’t think we should be able to distribute these on major platforms for profit,” one person said in a TikTok comment. As of Tuesday morning, “heart on my sleeve” had been removed from Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Amazon, YouTube and Tidal. The YouTube link for the song reads, “This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Universal Music Group.” Universal Music Group (UMG), which represents both Drake and The Weeknd, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shortly before “heart on my sleeve” went viral, UMG urged streaming services to prohibit artificial intelligence programs from using its copyrighted music to train themselves. “We have a moral and commercial responsibility to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms from ingesting content that violates the rights of artists and other creators,” UMG said in a statement to the Financial Times. “We expect our platform partners will want to prevent their services from being used in ways that harm artists.” Drake previously spoke out against an AI-generated cover of him rapping “Munch” by Ice Spice. In an Instagram story posted last Friday, Drake wrote, “This is the final straw AI” in response to the “Munch” dub. Edward Klaris, a media lawyer and managing partner at Klaris Law, said the song infringes on Drake and The Weeknd’s right of publicity, or the inherent right of an individual to control the commercial use of their likeness. In regards to the use of copyrighted songs to train AI models, Klaris said that “we’re all waiting for some court’s decision that’s going to tell us whether training data is OK or not OK.” We’re all waiting for some court’s decision that’s going to tell us whether training data is OK or not OK. -Edward Klaris, media lawyer and managing partner at Klaris Law “Here, they’re using all the pre-existing songs to create new songs,” Klaris said. “And so the Supreme Court could decide it’s not copyright infringement because it’s transformative … or they could say something different, like: ‘It is a copyright infringement. You can’t just take people’s songs and copy them to make new songs that sound just like that.’” For now, while streaming services have appeared to fulfill the wishes of UMG, Klaris said they don’t have a legal obligation to block these kinds of AI songs under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives internet service providers some immunity from their users’ content. As for the fate of “heart on my sleeve,” it appears ghostwriter is undeterred by the takedowns. In a comment under one of the recent TikTok videos, ghostwriter said, “add your number to the link in my bio & ill text u when it’s back on Apple Music & Spotify. you can’t kill a ghost.” The link in ghostwriter’s TikTok bio leads to their Laylo page and prompts visitors to enter their phone numbers so ghostwriter can “send you the Drake Ai song, and a new link if they take it down.” Laylo is a messaging platform that allows creators and artists to communicate directly with their fans and inform them of new drops. While there was some speculation that Laylo was behind the ghostwriter stunt, the company said in an email statement to NBC News that it was not involved in the creation of the song. While it’s unclear who ghostwriter is and what their motivations are, they assured fans on TikTok that “im just getting started.” "
FTC says it will target AI that is deceptive or violates civil rights,Reuters,"April 18, 2023, 6:12 PM UTC",Artificial intelligence,"Leaders of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday the agency would pursue companies who misuse artificial intelligence to violate laws against discrimination or be deceptive. The sudden popularity of Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT this year has prompted calls for regulation amid concerns around the world about the possible use of the innovation for wrongdoing even as companies are seeking ways to use it to enhance efficiency. In a congressional hearing, FTC Chair Lina Khan and Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya were asked about concerns that recent innovation in artificial intelligence, which can be used to produce high quality deep fakes, could be used to make more effective scams or otherwise violate laws. Bedoya said companies using algorithms or artificial intelligence were not allowed to violate civil rights laws or break rules against unfair and deceptive acts. “It’s not okay to say that your algorithm is a black box” and you can’t explain it, he said. Khan agreed the newest versions of AI could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams and any wrongdoing would “should put them on the hook for FTC action.” Slaughter noted that the agency had throughout its 100 year history had to adapt to changing technologies and indicated that adapting to ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools were no different. The commission is organized to have five members but currently has three, all of whom are Democrats. "
What you need to know about the Dominion v. Fox News trial,Jane C. Timm,"April 16, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC / Updated April 18, 2023, 1:48 PM UTC",Dominion v. Fox News,"The trial in Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox News is now set to begin Tuesday in a landmark defamation case that will determine whether the network can be held financially liable for publishing the false claim that voting machines rigged the 2020 election. Dominion was the subject of conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 presidential race as then-President Donald Trump and his allies relentlessly pushed the lie that the election, which he legitimately lost to President Joe Biden, was stolen from him. The trial had been scheduled to start Monday. The one-day delay was announced Sunday evening by the court without elaboration. In a pretrial ruling, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis agreed with Dominion that the claims Fox News hosts and guests promoted about the voting machine company are false. That leaves Dominion to try to convince the jury that Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corp., acted with “actual malice” — knowing falsity or reckless disregard for the truth — when it aired the conspiracy theories. Fox News has argued that the case is about the “First Amendment protections of the media’s absolute right to cover the news.” Here's what you need to know. Dominion Voting Systems is a privately owned corporation that makes voting equipment used in 28 states across the U.S. Dominion argues in its complaint that Fox News defamed it when the network broadcast baseless claims that it was tied to the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, that it paid kickbacks to politicians and that its machines “rigged” the 2020 presidential election by flipping millions of votes for Trump to Biden. In 2021, the company sued seeking $1.6 billion in damages and challenging a number of claims made by hosts and guests on Fox News and Fox Business and by host Lou Dobbs on social media. Not exactly. Dominion is suing Fox News Networks — which includes the namesake network and Fox Business — and Fox Corp., the more moneyed parent company. Fox News has argued that it was reporting on extraordinary claims of election fraud by Trump. In defending against the claims, Fox says that it is fighting to protect press freedoms and that the Constitution shields its work there. It has also argued that Dominion’s business wasn’t damaged. “Dominion’s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights. While Dominion has pushed irrelevant and misleading information to generate headlines, FOX News remains steadfast in protecting the rights of a free press, given a verdict for Dominion and its private equity owners would have grave consequences for the entire journalism profession,"" a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. Fox's lawyers have also argued that Fox Corp. wasn't involved in publishing the claims and therefore isn't liable for the alleged defamation. No. Dominion has already proven in court that the claims are baseless; Judge Davis ruled that he would instruct the jury that the claims are false. “The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” Davis wrote in an earlier 81-page ruling allowing the case to proceed to trial, emphasizing the word “crystal.” The case is a historic media law dispute with far-reaching implications. A victory for Fox News may fuel lawmakers’ efforts to limit the protections media outlets enjoy and would undoubtedly embolden people who want to broadcast false claims and conspiracy theories. A victory for Dominion could fuel copycat lawsuits. It would also be the first real apparent price paid for the stolen election lies Trump and his allies advanced. To prove Dominion was defamed, the company’s lawyers will need to prove that a damaging, false claim was published with actual malice — in other words, by a journalist who knew the claims were false or who recklessly disregarded the truth when they were published. At the end of last week, Davis announced the court had identified enough eligible jurors to impanel a jury. Lawyers will be permitted to strike certain jurors from the pool before the panel of 12 jurors (and 12 alternates) is seated. The court is then expected to take a short break before it returns to begin opening arguments. The jurors will remain anonymous, identified only by numbers. The trial is expected to last five to six weeks. The expected witness list includes a number of high-profile people, but when they might appear in court is an open question. Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., are expected to testify after Davis said he’s willing to compel their testimony. Past and present Fox News talent, including Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson, Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity and Bret Baier, are on the lawyers’ witnesses list, as well. Nope. No cameras are allowed, which is the policy of the court. Davis denied a request Thursday by a coalition of media to record and broadcast audio excerpts of the trial, as well. “You’re getting the most access of any media in a Superior Court case in Delaware,” he said Thursday. Fox Corp., the television networks’ parent company, is incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware. Nope. Dominion Voting Systems has brought a number of lawsuits against those it says defamed it after the 2020 election. So far, Dominion's lawyers have sued Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, as well as outlets Newsmax and One America News Network (OANN). A settlement is possible up until the point a verdict is rendered — which is likely to be just before Memorial Day weekend. All 12 jurors must agree unanimously to find Fox liable for defamation. "
Apple opens first India store as fans take selfies with CEO Tim Cook,Reuters,"April 18, 2023, 9:35 AM UTC",World,"MUMBAI, India — About 300 people lined up at Apple’s store in Mumbai on Tuesday, as fans took selfies with Chief Executive Tim Cook, who inaugurated the first retail store run by the tech giant in India, underscoring the importance of its market. “The energy, creativity, and passion in Mumbai is incredible!” Cook, who is making his first visit to India in seven years, said on Twitter. “We are so excited to open ... our first store in India.” People flocked to the store from across India, hoping to be among the first to enter, in an opening event featuring local music and folk dancers. Some had lined up outside since the previous night to get their hands on Apple products, even though they are available online in India. “The fanboy inside me would not listen,” Purav Mehta, 30, told Reuters, as he waited to get Cook’s signature on his boxed mint-condition iPod Touch, which he had bought on eBay, as well as waiting to buy the Apple Watch Ultra. Many visitors wore T-shirts in the style favored by co-founder Steve Jobs, had their hair cut in the shape of an Apple logo and one fan even brought a version of the first Apple computer launched in 1984. “The vibe here is just different,” said 23-year-old Aan Shah, who traveled from the western industrial city of Ahmedabad for the launch in India’s commercial capital. “It’s not like buying from some normal store. There’s just no comparison. It’s so exciting.” His love for Apple took him to store openings as a young student in New York and Boston, where he once got a chance to meet Cook, he said. Apple has previously faced hurdles in opening physical retail stores in the South Asian nation, but its products have been available on e-commerce websites, while its online store opened in 2020. The new store opens as Indian consumers increasingly look to upgrade their smartphones to glitzier models, with richer feature sets, from budget devices typically costing less than $120. Still, Apple’s phones are affordable for only a few in India, where it accounts for just a 3% share of the market. The new store, in the Reliance-owned Jio World Drive mall, opened for bloggers and tech analysts at a private event on Monday, while many Indian film and television celebrities were seen meeting Cook that night. A second store in Delhi, the capital, is set to open on Thursday. As Apple pushes to make India a bigger manufacturing base, some of its products, including iPhones, are being assembled in the country by Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron Corp. It also plans to assemble iPads and AirPods in India. "
U.S. ambassador visits Evan Gershkovich in Russian prison,Rose Horowitch,"April 17, 2023, 3:47 PM UTC / Updated April 17, 2023, 5:05 PM UTC",Politics News,"The U.S. ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, made her first visit to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich on Monday, more than two weeks after Russia detained him on espionage charges. “He is in good health and remains strong,"" Tracy tweeted from the U.S. Embassy account. ""We reiterate our call for his immediate release."" Russia had denied the embassy's requests for access to Gershkovich, who is being held at Moscow's Lefortovo Prison. Gershkovich was detained March 30 on suspicion of “espionage in the interests of the American government,” Russia’s Federal Security Service said in a statement, which was reported by Russian state media. Russian authorities have not provided evidence to support the charges. The Wall Street Journal and the Biden administration have repeatedly denied that Gershkovich was affiliated with the U.S. government. The Lefortovo Court in Moscow ordered Gershkovich to be detained initially until May 29, according to the official Telegram channel of the capital’s courts. Gershkovich denied the charges, according to the Tass state news agency. If he is convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison. On Tuesday, the court will hear a complaint Gershkovich filed against the decision to detain him ahead of a possible trial, Reuters reported, citing a court document. Last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinked formally declared that Russia had wrongfully detained Gershkovich. President Joe Biden, who called Gershkovich's family last Tuesday, told reporters that his detention is ""totally illegal."" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday that she was ""absolutely delighted"" that Tracy was allowed to see Gershkovich. ""But we still call for his unconditional release,"" she said. ""He is being held unfairly and unjustly, and the Russians need to allow him to return to his family."" ""We protest Russian efforts to limit and intimidate the media,"" Thomas-Greenfield continued. ""Free, independent and pluralistic media play an indispensable role in informing people around the world.” "
"The shape of your brain may strongly influence your thoughts and behavior, study finds",Aria Bendix,"May 31, 2023, 10:01 PM UTC",Health news,"Though much about the brain remains a mystery, scientists have long surmised that our thoughts, feelings and behavior are the result of billions of interconnected neurons that transmit signals to each other, thereby enabling communication between regions of the brain. But a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature challenges that idea, suggesting instead that the shape of the brain — its size, curves and grooves — may exert a greater influence on how we think, feel and behave than the connections and signals between neurons. A research team in Australia arrived at that conclusion after taking MRI scans of 255 people’s brains while the participants performed tasks like tapping their fingers or recalling a sequence of images. From there, the team examined 10,000 different maps of people’s brain activity, gathered from more than 1,000 experiments worldwide, to further assess the role of brain shape. Next, they created a computer model that simulated the way a brain's size and shape affect waves of electrical activity, better known as brain waves. They compared that model to a pre-existing computer model of brain activity that closely aligns with the understanding of neuron connectivity as the driver of brain function. The comparison showed that the new model provided a more accurate reconstruction of the brain activity shown in the MRI scans and brain activity maps than the prior model. James Pang, the study’s lead author and a research fellow at Monash University in Australia, likened the significance of brain shape to a pebble making ripples in a pond: The size and shape of the pond helps determine the nature of those ripples. ""The geometry is pretty important because it guides how the wave would look, which in turn relates to the activity patterns that you see when people perform different tasks,"" Pang said. David Van Essen, a neuroscience professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said the brain shape theory has been floated for more than a decade. But most researchers, he said, still subscribe to the classical hypothesis: that each of the brain's nearly 100 billion neurons, or nerve cells, has an axon, which functions like a wire to carry information to other neurons, and that enables brain activity. ""The fundamental starting hypothesis is that the wiring of the brain is central to understanding how the brain functions,"" Van Essen said. Pang said his research doesn't discount the significance of communication between neurons; rather, it suggests that the geometry of the brain plays a more essential role in brain function. ""What the work is showing is that the shape has a stronger influence, but it’s not saying that connectivity is not important,"" he said. Pang also noted that the brain shape hypothesis comes with an advantage: Brain shape is easier to measure than brain wiring, so paying closer attention to the size or curves of the brain could open new avenues for research. One topic worth exploring, he said, is the possible role of brain shape in the development of psychiatric and neurological diseases. In theory, Pang said, the speed at which traveling waves spread to different regions of the brain might affect how people process information. That, in turn, could contribute to patterns of brain activity associated with diseases like schizophrenia or depression. But not all scientists are convinced by the new research. Van Essen, for instance, remains skeptical. ""It would be an understatement to say this is a controversial theory, and it really needs to be put through its paces to evaluate critically whether it stands the test of time,"" he said. Van Essen raised several concerns about the study, including the fact that the researchers' models are based on an average of the shapes of participants' brains. According to Van Essen, that approach glosses over dramatic differences in patterns of surface folds from one brain to the next. Pang, however, said the findings ""remain robust"" even after performing an individual-level analysis of brain shape. Van Essen also cautioned that MRIs are imperfect tools and may not reliably capture the nature of the brain's wiring. ""As exciting and informative as it is, it's still inaccurate in fundamental ways and incomplete, and leaves a lot left to be sorted out by future studies,"" he said of MRI technology. Pang said his research isn't definitive, but added that in his view, the new study ""strengthens the theory"" that brain shape has a greater influence on brain activity than the wiring of neurons. ""We're pretty confident that the influence is really there,"" he said. "
Indiana board reprimands Dr. Caitlin Bernard over 10-year-old's abortion case,Aria Bendix,"May 25, 2023, 5:43 PM UTC / Updated May 26, 2023, 3:26 PM UTC",Abortion Rights,"Indiana’s medical board on Thursday determined that a doctor who spoke publicly about providing an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim violated privacy rules, and imposed a fine. The Indiana Medical Licensing Board voted to fine Dr. Caitlin Bernard $3,000 and issue a letter of reprimand — but did not suspend her license. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, had accused Bernard of failing to report child abuse and violating patient privacy by speaking to a reporter about the young girl's case. In a written complaint in November, Rokita asked the state licensing board to impose a disciplinary action on Bernard accordingly. In July, The Indianapolis Star reported that Bernard had taken a call from a doctor regarding a suspected case of child abuse involving the 10-year-old girl from Ohio. The child was just over six weeks pregnant. Ohio prohibits abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy, under a law that was enacted after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The girl went to Indiana to receive care from Bernard, the Star reported, where abortion was legal. Since then, Indiana has passed a near-total abortion ban, though a judge subsequently put the law on hold. The licensing board decided that in seeking penalties for Bernard, the state met its burden in three counts, which deal with privacy, but the group rejected two others that dealt with reporting child abuse and being unfit to practice. The president of the licensing board, Dr. John Strobel, called Bernard “a good doctor.” The hearing lasted more than 14 hours. ""I am certain that Dr. Bernard has learned a lot about privacy,"" Strobel said. ""You get consent, and then you can talk about it, and you can make some very good points and educate the public,"" he said near the end of the hearing. Cory Voight, director of complex litigation for the Indiana attorney general’s office, told the board during the hearing that Bernard had violated state law by not maintaining the patient’s confidentiality and not reporting the case to Indiana law enforcement and the Indiana Department of Child Services. Voight added that Bernard also violated HIPAA, an act that prohibits medical professionals from disclosing a patient’s sensitive health information without their consent or knowledge. ""This is not a typical hearing. There's been no case like this before the board. No physician has been as brazen in pursuit of their own agenda,"" Voight said in opening remarks. But Bernard's lawyer, Alice Morical, said that Bernard did report child abuse in a manner consistent with Indiana law, since she informed a social worker at her university about the 10-year-old patient. Where HIPAA is concerned, Morical added, Bernard did not violate the law because her comments to The Indianapolis Star did not include identifying information such as a patient's name, date of birth or date of hospital admission. ""Physicians can talk to the media,"" Morical said. Bernard sent Rokita a cease-and-desist letter in July asking him to stop making ""false or misleading statements"" about her. ""If the attorney general Todd Rokita had not chosen to make this his political stunt, we wouldn’t be here today,"" she said during the Thursday hearing. Indiana University Health, where Bernard works as an OB-GYN, investigated the issue last year and determined that Bernard had complied with patient privacy laws. In a statement on Friday, the health system said it maintains that Bernard did properly follow privacy laws. ""We are pleased she will continue to be a member of our medical team and provide compassionate care to her patients,"" the health system said. ""We do not agree with the Board’s decision regarding patient privacy regulations and stand by the HIPAA risk assessment."" Bernard's case has been highly publicized, since her story about the young girl elicited strong reactions from both sides of the aisle. ""Ten years old. Raped, six weeks pregnant. Already traumatized. Was forced to travel to another state. Imagine being that little girl,"" President Joe Biden said in a news conference in July, when he signed an executive order to safeguard abortion access. The order included protections for those who travel from a state that prohibits abortion to a state where the service is legal. Some Republican leaders, including Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, falsely suggested that same month that Bernard had fabricated the story of her young patient, as did Fox News commentator Jesse Watters and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. ""I was surprised that people think that young girls are not, unfortunately, frequently raped and become pregnant,"" Bernard said during the Thursday hearing. ""The idea that this was something that someone would make up or was a lie, or is something that doesn't happen, was very surprising to me."" An Ohio man, Gerson Fuentes, was charged with the 10-year-old girl's rape in July, and a detective testified that month that the girl had received an abortion in Indianapolis on June 30. It has not been made public what Fuentes' relationship to the girl was prior to the alleged rape. Bernard said Thursday that her colleague in Ohio told her the girl's two brothers and her mother's boyfriend were possible suspects. ""This case was about patient privacy and the trust between the doctor and patient that was broken,” Rokita’s office said in a statement on Thursday night, after the medical board's decision. An attorney for Bernard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "
"Mpox is down, but U.S. cities could be at risk for summertime outbreaks",Associated Press,"May 26, 2023, 12:30 PM UTC",OUT Health and Wellness,"The mpox health emergency has ended, but U.S. health officials are aiming to prevent a repeat of last year’s outbreaks. Mpox infections exploded early in the summer of 2022 in the wake of Pride gatherings. More than 30,000 U.S. cases were reported last year, most of them spread during sexual contact between gay and bisexual men. About 40 people died. With Pride events planned across the country in the coming weeks, health officials and event organizers say they are optimistic that this year infections will be fewer and less severe. A bigger supply of vaccine, more people with immunity and readier access to a drug to treat mpox are among the reasons. But they also worry that people may think of mpox as last year’s problem. “Out of sight, out of mind,” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who is advising the White House on its mpox response. “But we are beating the drum.” Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to U.S. doctors to watch for new cases. On Thursday, the agency published a modeling study that estimated the likelihood of mpox resurgence in 50 counties that have been the focus of a government campaign to control sexually transmitted diseases. The study concluded that 10 of the counties had a 50% chance or higher of mpox outbreaks this year. The calculation was based largely on how many people were considered at high risk for infection and what fraction of them had some immunity through vaccination or previous infection. At the top of the list are Jacksonville, Florida; Memphis, Tennessee; and Cincinnati — cities where 10% or fewer of the people at highest risk were estimated to have immunity. Another 25 counties have low or medium immunity levels that put then at a higher risk for outbreaks. The study had a range of limitations, including that scientists don’t know how long immunity from vaccination or prior infections lasts. So why do the study? To warn people, said Dr. Chris Braden, who heads the CDC’s mpox response. “This is something that is important for jurisdictions to promote prevention of mpox, and for the population to take note — and take care of themselves. That’s why we’re doing this,” he said. Officials are trying to bring a sense of urgency to a health threat that was seen as a burgeoning crisis last summer but faded away by the end of the year. Formerly known as monkeypox, mpox is caused by a virus in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals, but was not known to spread easily among people. Cases began emerging in Europe and the U.S. about a year ago, mostly among men who have sex with men, and escalated in dozens of countries in June and July. The infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Countries scrambled to find a vaccine or other countermeasures. In late July, the World Health Organization declared a health emergency. The U.S. followed with its own in early August. But then cases began to fall, from an average of nearly 500 a day in August to fewer than 10 by late December. Experts attributed the decline to several factors, including government measures to overcome a vaccine shortage and efforts in the gay and bisexual community to spread warnings and limit sexual encounters. The U.S. emergency ended in late January, and the WHO ended its declaration earlier this month. Indeed, there is a lower sense of urgency about mpox than last year, said Dan Dimant, a spokesman for NYC Pride. The organization anticipates fewer messages about the threat at its events next month, though plans could change if the situation worsens. There were long lines to get shots during the height of the crisis last year, but demand faded as cases declined. The government estimates that 1.7 million people — mostly men who have sex with men — are at high risk for mpox infection, but only about 400,000 have gotten the recommended two doses of the vaccine. “We’re definitely not where we need to be,” Daskalakis said, during an interview last week at an STD conference in New Orleans. Some see possible storm clouds on the horizon. Cases emerged this year in some European countries and South Korea. On Thursday, U.K. officials said an uptick in mpox cases in London in the last month showed that the virus was not going away. Nearly 30 people, many of them fully vaccinated, were infected in a recent Chicago outbreak. (As with COVID-19 and flu shot, vaccinated people can still get mpox, but they likely will have milder symptoms, officials say.) Dr. Joseph Cherabie, associate medical director of the St. Louis County Sexual Health Clinic, said people from the area travel to Chicago for events, so outbreaks there can have ripple effects elsewhere. “We are several weeks behind Chicago. Chicago is usually our bellwether,” Cherabie said. Chicago health officials are taking steps to prevent further spread at an “International Mr. Leather” gathering this weekend. Event organizers are prominently advising attendees to get vaccinated. Chicago health officials put together social media messages, including one depicting three candles and a leather paddle that reads: “Before you play with leather or wax get yourself the mpox vax.” "
"Marijuana linked to mental health risks in young adults, growing evidence shows","Akshay Syal, M.D.","May 26, 2023, 9:30 AM UTC",Mental Health,"Over the last decade of diagnosing countless young patients with new psychotic disorders, one striking result has stuck out for New York City psychiatrist Dr. Ryan Sultan. “Of all the people I’ve diagnosed with a psychotic disorder,” he said, “I can’t think of a single one who wasn’t also positive for cannabis.” Sultan, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia Irving Medical Center, is one of many experts raising serious concerns about the increasing marijuana use by adolescents and young adults. And the evidence is growing of marijuana’s association with psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, especially in young men. New research published this month, involving millions of people worldwide over decades, is adding to worries that heavy use of high-potency cannabis and legalization of recreational weed in many U.S. states could exacerbate the nation's mental health crisis in young adults. “There is a big sense of urgency not just because more people are smoking marijuana, but because more people are using it in ways that are harmful, with higher and higher concentration of THC,” Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), said in an interview. One of the studies, from researchers in Denmark in collaboration with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, found evidence of an association between cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia. The finding was most striking in young men ages 21-30, but was also seen in women of the same age. The paper, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, looked at data from almost 7 million men and women in Denmark over the course of a few decades to look for a link between schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder. The magnitude of the connection between cannabis and schizophrenia for young men surprised study author Volkow, who was expecting the number to be closer to 10%. “This is worrisome,” she said. There are now 22 states that allow recreational use of marijuana, with Minnesota likely to become the next state to legalize it. Whether recreational cannabis laws contribute to underage consumption is unclear, but Volkow has made addressing cannabis use among teenagers one of NIDA’s top priorities. Daily marijuana use among young adults has risen to record highs, with more than 1 in 10 of young adults ages 19-30 now reporting daily use, and almost half reporting use within the last year, according to the agency's most recent data. Another study, led by Sultan and Columbia researchers published earlier this month, found that teenagers who use cannabis only recreationally are two to four times more likely to develop psychiatric disorders, including  depression and suicidality, than teenagers who don’t use cannabis at all. Because research to date has been observational and doesn’t directly prove cause and effect, the connection between marijuana and psychiatric disorders is controversial. It’s unclear whether people who already have or are developing psychiatric conditions are more likely to turn to cannabis as a way to self-medicate or whether cannabis use triggers mental problems. Volkow is optimistic that a large ongoing study on adolescent brain development at the National Institutes of Health can help answer this question. Sultan acknowledged the limitations of the evidence. “It’s sort of this circular feedback where they’re kind of just feeding off each other,” he said. Dr. Deepak D’Souza, a psychiatrist at Yale University who has been studying cannabis for 20 years, insists there are too many lines of evidence to ignore. “We may be grossly underestimating the potential risks associated with cannabis,” he said. Given increasing legalization and rising potency in cannabis products, D’Souza has never been more worried about the mental health effects of cannabis use among youth. “This is a massive concern,” he said. “We have been woefully inept in educating the public and influencing policy.” Early data suggests that in young adults ages 18-25, legalization is leading to higher rates of cannabis use, particularly in Oregon and Washington, according to an analysis published earlier this month in the journal Substance Abuse. The research, led by researchers from McMaster University in Canada, found the evidence in other age groups a little less clear, and more research is needed to understand how legalization is affecting rates of cannabis use. In areas where marijuana becomes legal and easier to access, Volkow’s concern is the ease with which products can be mixed, leading to a high total dose of marijuana consumed. One of the biggest issues, she says, is the lack of regulation on the concentration of THC in products. Marijuana consumed decades ago had concentrations of THC, the main psychoactive ingredient, of 2 to 3%, but cannabis products today can have THC levels as high as 90%. “That’s not even the case for alcohol as you cannot put more than a certain percent alcohol into liquor,” she said. “The same thing with tobacco cigarettes, you regulate how much nicotine they have. Here, we have no regulation.” THC potency is significant, Volkow said, because cannabis is more likely to be linked to psychosis with higher doses consumed. Research has shown that the human brain is the last organ to fully develop and doesn’t finish until the mid-to-late 20s. That makes adolescents and young adults particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis as their brains continue to mature. “Really, the ideal time to consider using weed — if you’re going to use it — is 26 or later,” Sultan said. People who wait until at least age 26 are much less likely to become addicted or develop mental disorders, said Dr. Sharon Levy, a pediatrician and addiction specialist at Boston Children’s Hospital. “The greatest risks are clearly in the adolescent and young adult age range,” she said. However, people with a family history of a psychotic disorder shouldn’t use cannabis at all, Sultan cautioned Although scientists are still learning about the effects of marijuana on developing brains, studies so far suggest marijuana use in teenagers may affect functions such as attention, memory and learning, multiple studies have found. “It’s somehow interfering with the connections that we use in our brain to distinguish between what’s going on in our heads and what’s going on outside of our heads,” Levy said in reference to the psychotic symptoms that can happen. D’Souza added that cannabis use can have serious impacts on the developing brain because of its effects on the endocannabinoid system, a complex signaling system in the brain that marijuana targets. “Endocannabinoid systems play an important role in sculpting the brain during adolescence, which is when schizophrenia usually manifests itself,” he said. Disturbing that system with cannabis use could have “far reaching complex implications on brain development.” "
NIH trial zeroes in on common long Covid symptoms,Erika Edwards,"May 25, 2023, 4:50 PM UTC",Coronavirus,"A long-awaited study that zeroes in on the most common groups of symptoms for people with long Covid may not bring the relief millions of Americans and doctors have been wanting. The study, some of the first research from the National Institutes of Health’s billion-dollar RECOVER program, does not provide a standardized definition of the condition. Researchers say it is a first step in identifying ""common language"" for scientists working toward treatments for the condition. ""I think that the amount of science that's going to come after this is going to be an avalanche,"" said study author Dr. Leora Horwitz, a professor of population health and medicine at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, as well as the director of the Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science at NYU Langone Health. The new study, published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at data from 9,764 adults in the RECOVER trial, which has been recruiting participants since last year. The vast majority, 8,646 people, had previously been diagnosed with Covid. While hundreds of symptoms possibly associated with long Covid have long been reported — mostly through anecdotes from patients — the new study homes in on 12 of the most common. The aim of the paper is not to limit the definition of long Covid to these 12 symptoms only. It's meant to focus future research into those symptoms as scientists work to figure out how long Covid affects the body in so many different ways. It also includes a scoring system that can be tailored to each patient based on the severity of their symptoms. ""This is a tool that can be used to identify people with long Covid for the purpose of doing more research,"" said Andrea Foulkes, the principal investigator of the RECOVER Data Resource Core, as well as the director of biostatistics at Massachusetts General Hospital, which is part of the Mass General Brigham hospital system. ""The significance of that is that we can then begin to unravel the mechanisms for each of those different manifestations. And then of course, ultimately, the goal is to identify treatments,"" Foulkes said. But the paper, anxiously anticipated by people who still have long Covid symptoms and the physicians who treat them, has raised some criticism. ""I think people will be underwhelmed by a 'landmark' paper that is describing the presence of symptoms that people have long known are a problem,"" said Jim Jackson, the director of Behavioral Health,  ICU Recovery Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and author of ""Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving With Long Covid—A Practical Guide."" ""This isn't a paper that offers any solutions, that offers any therapeutics. And that's desperately what people want: hope in the form of treatments,"" Jackson said. There needs to be more specificity with describing the symptoms, Jackson said, taking issue with the vagueness of the term ""brain fog."" ""What exactly does brain fog mean? If we call it a brain injury, then there's a treatment path. We know how to treat brain injuries,"" Jackson said. ""We do cognitive rehab. If we call it brain fog, what on earth do you do with that?"" Horwitz added some clarity during an interview. Brain fog, in these cases, includes having to read something several times to understand it, having trouble keeping appointments that aren't part of a weekly routine, and difficulty following complex directions. Another term ""abnormal movements,"" was also vague. During interviews with NBC News, RECOVER researchers were unable to further define what patients meant by ""abnormal movements"" as a symptom. ""The finding is a new one and requires further study,"" Foulkes said. ""When someone walks into my office, and I'm trying to screen them or discuss with them whether they have long Covid,"" said Dr. Hugh Cassiere, director for critical care services at South Shore University Hospital, part of Northwell Health in New York, ""you've rendered that useless as a symptom to me because you can't define it."" Neither Jackson nor Cassiere were involved with the RECOVER trial. The research also found that long Covid patients who were unvaccinated were more likely to have severe symptoms, as well as people who were infected before the omicron variant took hold. They also found that some symptoms tend to cluster together: post-exertional malaise and fatigue for example, or fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, upset stomach, heart palpitations and post-exertional malaise all together in other cases. Researchers said they expect to start enrolling long Covid patients in clinical trials for treatments this year. ""We don't want to forget about these people as we move into different phases of pandemic,"" said Tanayott Thaweethai, another study author and associate director of biostatistics research and engagement for MGH Biostatistics. ""We want to be really thoughtful about how we study them, how we try to understand what's happening in their tissue in their bodies. All of this takes time in understanding such a complicated chronic disease,"" Thaweethai said. As of April, 15.1% of the more than 100 million Americans with Covid had long-term symptoms, according to a government survey. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
FDA grants full approval to Paxlovid to treat Covid in high-risk adults,"Annika Kim Constantino, CNBC","May 25, 2023, 3:02 PM UTC",Coronavirus,"The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday granted full approval to Pfizer’s Covid antiviral pill, Paxlovid, for adults who are at high risk of getting severely sick with the virus. Paxlovid is specifically advised for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid in adults older than 50 and people who suffer from certain medical conditions that place them at a higher risk of ending up in the hospital or dying from Covid. That includes those who have diabetes, heart conditions, cancer or a weak immune system. As many as three-quarters of adults in the U.S. are at high risk of severe Covid. The FDA first made Paxlovid available in December 2021 under emergency use authorization for high-risk individuals ages 12 and up. Under that designation, the FDA quickly approved the treatment based on preliminary clinical trial data. The FDA’s latest decision means there is now extensive clinical data indicating Paxlovid is safe and effective. The treatment consists of two medications: nirmatrelvir, which blocks a key enzyme that the Covid virus needs to replicate, and ritonavir, which boosts the first medication’s ability to fight the infection. Both Pfizer and the FDA view the treatment as an important complementary tool to vaccination that can help high-risk Americans manage their Covid infections and ultimately save lives. FDA researchers estimated, based on Covid rates in January, that Paxlovid could “lead to 1,500 lives saved and 13,000 hospitalizations averted each week” in the U.S. But it’s unclear what uptake will look like later this year. The U.S. has 1.1 million courses of the treatment available for free nationwide. Once that runs out, the government will shift the distribution of Paxlovid to the commercial market. That means Pfizer will sell Paxlovid directly to healthcare providers at a price the company hasn’t disclosed. Paxlovid is priced at about $530 per course now. Pfizer, which saw Paxlovid sales jump to nearly $19 billion in 2022, expects revenue from the drug to drop 58% in 2023. In March, an independent panel of advisors to the FDA recommended the  treatment based on three of Pfizer’s clinical trials. One trial examined high-risk adults who were unvaccinated and had no prior Covid infection. That trial found Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 86% in adults treated within five days of their first symptoms, and 89% in those treated within three days, according to an FDA review of the company’s data. No major safety concerns were identified in the trial, the review said, though the agency flagged 137 medications that may lead to serious adverse reactions if they interact with Paxlovid. The FDA said the most common drugs that caused safety issues were immunosuppressants, which are often used to treat HIV and organ transplant patients. The FDA’s office of surveillance and epidemiology recorded 271 reports of serious adverse events potentially related to drug interactions with Paxlovid, including 147 hospitalizations and six deaths, as of late January. FDA staff said those events could potentially be avoided by adjusting the dose of certain drugs, increasing patient monitoring and ensuring that product labeling informs prescribers and patients of potential drug interactions. For some doctors, another area of concern is Paxlovid “rebound cases.” That’s when patients who take the treatment see their Covid symptoms return or test positive shortly after they initially recover. Reports of those cases cropped up not long after Paxlovid first entered the market. Both President Joe Biden and his former chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci seemingly recovered from Covid after taking the antiviral cocktail but tested positive again soon after recovering. An FDA review of Pfizer’s clinical trials found overall rates of rebound ranged from 10% to 16%, “with no evidence of a higher rate of symptom rebound or moderate symptom rebound” in patients who received Paxlovid compared with patients who received a placebo. Those results also held regardless of patients’ risk of severe disease, or whether the omicron variant or an earlier strain of the virus was dominant, according to the FDA review. "
Multivitamins may help slow loss of memory as people get older,Linda Carroll,"May 24, 2023, 10:17 PM UTC / Updated May 25, 2023, 12:54 PM UTC",Aging,"Multivitamin supplements may help slow the normal forgetfulness that comes with aging, researchers reported Wednesday. The analysis of data from more than 3,500 older participants  showed that those who took a daily Centrum Silver pill over a period of three years had better memories than those who received a placebo treatment, according to the report published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The effects seen in the study are “very, very encouraging,” said study co-author Adam Brickman, a professor of neuropsychology at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. “Cognitive change and memory loss are a top health concern for older adults,” he said. “And we don’t have many strategies to mitigate the changes that come with aging. So it’s encouraging that a supplement can help address one of the main health concerns older adults have.” To explore whether a daily multivitamin could benefit cognitive function, the researchers turned to participants in the Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a multiyear study which has enrolled 21,442 older men and women to investigate the effects of cocoa  supplements and multivitamins on cognition and the risk of cancer and cardiovascular events. Haleon, formerly known as Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, makes Centrum Silver and provided vitamins used in the trial. Mars Edge, part of the Mars candy and snack maker, partially funded the study with the National Institutes of Health. Neither company had any role in designing the trial or input in the findings. For the new study, Brickman and his colleagues followed a subset of 3,562 individuals from the larger trial who were randomly assigned to receive a multivitamin or a placebo. The researchers used a new web-based test to evaluate participants’ memories at the beginning of the study, at one year and at three years. Compared to the placebo group, the men and women taking a daily multivitamin did significantly better on the memory test, which evaluated a person’s ability to immediately reproduce a list of words after reading it, the study found. The researchers estimate that the multivitamin intervention improved memory performance by the equivalent of 3.1 years compared tothe placebo. It’s the second large study to find a cognitive benefit from taking the multivitamins. Last year, another trial, COSMOS-Mind, found that daily multivitamins were associated with a 60% slowing of cognitive aging globally. That study also used data from a subset of COSMOS participants. It’s not uncommon for researchers to fail to replicate the results of “big flashy studies,” Brickman said. “We have a clear replication of the effect of multivitamins on cognition. That gives us a lot more confidence in the data.” The researchers don’t yet know which ingredient in the multivitamins, which include A, C, B vitamins and zinc, might be driving the effects on cognition. “It’s important to understand this,” said epidemiologist Howard Sesso, an associate professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School and study co-author. It’s also not clear whether these results would be seen with other brands of multivitamins. “This particular brand was selected because it is commonly used in the U.S. and has a good quality and safety record,” said Sesso, who is also a researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “In addition, we tested a very similar Centrum Silver formulation” in an earlier study called the Physicians’ Health Study II, he said. That study found no cognitive benefit from taking multivitamins. The researchers have not yet looked at other types of multivitamins to determine if they would work as well or if the benefit is specific to a certain formulation. The effect seen by the researchers is relatively small, so that an individual might not notice any improvement although it can be seen in the larger data, said Dr. Paul Newhouse, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Cognitive Medicine, who was not involved with the new research. It’s notable “neither group showed a decline in cognition,” he said. “Rather, you’re seeing the degree to which one group improved over three years.” Although the effect is small, using multivitamins along with other lifestyle modifications already shown to reduce the risk of cognitive decline, such as exercise and following the Mediterranean diet, might lead to a larger combined impact, he said. Newhouse doesn't recommend that doctors prescribe multivitamins to their patients to prevent cognitive decline. “We need longer studies,” he said. “But this study does suggest that multivitamin supplementation is not harmful and may be potentially beneficial.” Also, because the participants had either finished or attended college, the results might not be the same for other groups of people, said Dr. Riddhi Patira, an investigator at the Alzheimer’s Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The are also not typical of the patients she sees, who are already experiencing cognitive decline. “These are normal individuals who are able to go online to take the test,” Patira said. “They are highly motivated people.” When patients ask her for lifestyle changes that might help prevent cognitive decline, she suggests a healthy diet. Patira, who was not involved with the new study, feels the follow-up isn’t long enough to suggest multivitamins for a cognitive boost. In healthy people with normal cognition, declines “move so slow, it’s hard to detect anything meaningful after a year,” she said, adding that differences might not be detectable for five to 20 years.

New clues emerge about possible factors behind sudden infant death syndrome,Aria Bendix,"May 25, 2023, 4:00 AM UTC",Health news,"Sudden infant death syndrome, the unforeseen and unexplained death of a baby younger than one year old, is by definition a mystery. But researchers are getting closer to understanding some of the risk factors and mechanisms that contribute to SIDS. The prevailing theory points to three possible factors: First, the infant is at a critical stage of development during the first year of life. Second, the baby is exposed to a stressor, such as sleeping face down, which can lower the amount of oxygen in their blood while raising the level of carbon dioxide. And third, the infant has an underlying abnormality that makes it harder to survive that traumatic event. A study published Thursday in the Journal of Neuropathology & Experimental Neurology points to one such abnormality. Researchers from Boston Children’s Hospital and Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego found that a particular brain receptor likely involved in helping babies gasp for air was altered in some infants who died of SIDS. The receptor in question is part of the serotonin system, which plays an important role in regulating involuntary body functions like heart rate, breathing and blood pressure. SIDS usually happens during an infant’s sleep, and though it's rare, it's the leading cause of death among babies between one month and one year old in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed nearly 1,400 infant deaths to SIDS in 2020. To better understand the condition, the researchers behind the new study examined brain tissue from 58 infants who died of SIDS between 2004 and 2011, then compared those samples to the brain tissue of 12 infants who died of other causes, such as pneumonia or heart disease. The results showed that the babies who'd died of SIDS were more likely to have an altered version of the serotonin-related brain receptor than the control cases. Robin Haynes, the study’s lead author and a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital, said that babies normally have a protective response that prompts them to gasp for air when they don't get enough oxygen during sleep. ""They arouse and they go through what’s called auto-resuscitation, where it kick-starts breathing,"" she said. With SIDS, however, that response may not kick in, perhaps because of the altered brain receptor. If an infant is unable to restore their breathing and heart rate, that can hinder blood flow and oxygen supply. The Boston-based research group behind the new study has been investigating the relationship between SIDS and serotonin for about three decades, and has published multiple papers based on various analyses of the same brain tissue samples. Those samples are some of the only ones available to SIDS researchers. But that small sample size makes it hard to draw strong inferences about potential causes or risk factors, according to Dr. José Javier Otero, director of neuropathology at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. ""It’s almost, from a scientific standpoint, courageous to attempt to even try to make a conclusion,"" Otero said. Still, researchers have long suspected that serotonin plays some role in SIDS given its association with breathing. ""It makes total sense that serotonin should be a key player,"" said Dr. Debra Weese-Mayer, chief of the pediatric autonomic medicine division at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. ""The question is: Is it the only player?"" It's likely that genetics also affects an infant's vulnerability to SIDS, though scientists aren't sure in what capacity, Weese-Mayer said. Another factor may be infections that infants contract early in life, according to Dr. Michelle Caraballo, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children’s Health in North Texas and an assistant professor at UT Southwestern. ""Rates of SIDS are highest in the winter. That's also when we see the highest rates of viral infections in babies,"" she said. No tests exist to reveal whether a baby has an underlying predisposition to SIDS — and since no causes have been confirmed, there are no treatments to lower an infant's risk. But Haynes said researchers haven't given up on that prospect. ""Once you identify an infant with a particular abnormality, the goal one day is to have a preventative therapy, but what that looks like yet we can’t say,"" she said. There are still ways to protect against SIDS, however. The CDC recommends that parents place sleeping babies on their backs at all times. A baby's sleep area should be firm, flat and free of soft toys and bedding such as blankets, pillows and bumper pads. Parents shouldn't cover their baby's head during sleep time, and babies should ideally sleep in the same room as their parents until they're at least 6 months old. The American Academy of Pediatrics also suggests giving babies a pacifier at nap time and bedtime once they're comfortable breastfeeding. Breastfeeding has been shown to lower the risk of SIDS, while using alcohol or tobacco while pregnant can raise the risk. ""We do want people to follow the safe sleep guidelines as much as possible,"" Caraballo said. ""The really scary thing is that it is possible to do everything right and the baby still to die. At the end of the day, we don't know the exact cause of death in the majority of cases."" "
"Brain and spine implants enabled a paralyzed man to climb stairs and walk on rough terrain, study shows",Aria Bendix,"May 24, 2023, 3:00 PM UTC",Health news,"A 40-year-old man whose legs are paralyzed is able to climb stairs, move over ramps and switch from standing to walking, thanks to implants in his brain and spinal cord that pair with external devices to translate his thoughts into movement. The experiment was part of a proof-of-concept study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The patient, Gert-Jan Oskam, suffered a spinal cord injury from a motor bike accident 12 years ago. ""When we met him, he was completely paralyzed, unable to take a step by himself without assistance,"" said Grégoire Courtine, the study’s author and a neuroscientist at EPFL, a research university in Switzerland. In 2017, Oskam received an experimental implant in his spinal cord as part of a different clinical trial, which helped him regain his ability to walk. By lifting his heel slightly — which he could do on his own — Oskam would trigger an electrical current that stimulated nerves in his spinal cord to allow him to take steps. But those steps were clunky, and he couldn't navigate around obstacles or walk on uneven surfaces. ""I felt like with every step a bit stressed, like I had to be in time with the rhythm, otherwise I wouldn't make a good step,"" Oskam said during a call with reporters on Tuesday. And, after two years of this electrical nerve stimulation, as the approach is known, Oskam's recovery plateaued. So he joined the proof-of-concept study in 2021. The system is different from existing technologies in its ability to translate brain signals into movement. When Oskam thinks about moving his legs, the implant in his brain sends a signal to an external computer, which Oskam wears as a backpack. The computer then processes and relays that signal to a pacemaker in Oskam's abdomen, which in turn sends electrical pulses to the older implant that was already in his spinal cord. That prompts Oskam's legs to move. A helmet with two antennas helps the implants stay connected to the computer. Older technologies that use electrical nerve stimulation, while studied more, have relied on tiny movements from the patient or the click of a button to help the patient walk. Henri Lorach, another EPFL scientist involved in the research, told reporters that by using the new system, Oskam could walk naturally after several minutes of training. He also gained more control over his leg movements and was able navigate tricker terrain, like gravel paths. ""The stimulation before was controlling me, and now I’m controlling the stimulation,"" Oskam said. He added that he can now walk 100 to 200 meters (around 330 to 660 feet) per day and stand unsupported for about two or three minutes. ""Last week, something needed to be painted and there was nobody to help me so I took the walker and the paint and I did it myself while I was standing,"" he said. Peter Grahn, an engineer at Mayo Clinic’s department of neurologic surgery who was not involved in the new study, said an obvious advantage to the technology is that it’s less cumbersome than exoskeleton devices, which support walking via bulky metal frames. ""A lot of devices have shown improvement in people with spinal cord injury, but then people go home and that device sits in their closet,"" Grahn said. Oskam's steps are still slow, but Courtine said future versions of the technology might someday allow him to move faster. The researchers noted that during the study, Oskam regained the ability to walk with crutches even when the technology was turned off. They believe the implant system may have activated pathways in his brain that had gone dormant but were still anatomically intact. ""What these technologies do is maximize existing hardware, basically, in the nervous system. What happens, we believe, is that by reactivating these pathways, they strengthen them,"" said Marco Capogrosso, an assistant professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. Capogrosso, who assisted with an earlier version of the research that tested the new technology in monkeys, published a paper last year demonstrating that electrical nerve stimulation can help people regain arm and hand movement after a stroke. But it's unclear if the new technology would work well for people with more severe paralysis, he said. Megan Gill, an assistant professor of physical therapy at the Mayo Clinic who also wasn't involved in the study, similarly said it’s hard to tell how much the technology affected Oskam’s recovery, given that his injury was moderate and he underwent rehabilitation prior to the study. The implant system ""isn’t taking someone completely paralyzed from lying in bed and not moving to up and walking,"" Gill said. ""This person had some ability to stand. They had some ability to walk even before this technology was implanted."" What's more, Grahn said, most people with paralysis haven’t had the electrical nerve stimulation that Oskam received, which makes it difficult to know how well the technology would work in other cases. ""Technologically, I’m kind of floored by this paper, but for real-world application, there’s a lot of challenges,"" he said. Courtine was more optimistic. ""There is no reason why it would not apply to the vast majority of people with spinal cord injury,"" he said. Courtine pointed to his own previous research, which found last  year that a form of electrical nerve stimulation without a brain implant helped three people without independent motor function regain their ability to stand and step. ""There is no reason why, if you add the brain control, it will not be much, much better,"" he said. Dave Marver, the CEO of Onward, the medical technology company that’s developing the new system that Oskam uses, said the company has additional trials planned over the next 12 to 18 months. Two people will receive implants in an effort to help them walk, and two others to restore hand and arm function, he said. Marver estimated that the system could become commercially available in four to seven years, though it would first need Food and Drug Administration approval. He said that Onward plans to work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to get the technology covered by insurance. ""The average cost over a lifetime to support somebody with tetraplegia is $5 million,” Marver said. “If you could introduce something that’s $25,000 to $50,000, you can imagine over time that saves Medicare [or] private payers quite a bit of money."" Gill, however, noted that clinicians would need training on how to use the highly technical system. ""As a physical therapist, if someone walked into my gym and had this thing implanted, I would have no idea what to do with it,"" she said. "
U.S. progress in HIV fight continues to trail many other rich nations,Benjamin Ryan,"May 23, 2023, 5:00 PM UTC",OUT Health and Wellness,"New HIV infections continue to ebb only modestly in the United States, while many other wealthy Western nations have posted steep reductions, thanks to more successful efforts overseas to promptly diagnose and treat the virus and promote the HIV prevention pill, PrEP. In a new HIV surveillance report published Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that new HIV transmissions declined by 12% nationally between 2017 and 2021, from 36,500 to 32,100 cases. By comparison, according to estimates by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, between 2015 and 2021, the annual infection rate plunged by more than 70% in the Netherlands, 68% in Italy and 44% in Australia. United Kingdom health authorities recorded about 2,700 diagnoses in England in 2021 — a drop of approximately one-third since 2017 and one-half since 2015. Experts told NBC News that the U.S. remains so far behind in combating HIV because of the nation’s lack of a national health care system and sexual-health clinic network; fragmented and underfunded public health systems; and poorer synchronization between government, academia, health care and community-based organizations. These experts also pointed to factors such as racism, inadequate adoption of evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, state laws criminalizing HIV exposure and medical mistrust in people of color. “HIV in the United States is very much a disease of those who are most disenfranchised in society,” Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University, said. The 2010s heralded the era of so-called biomedical HIV prevention. A series of landmark studies established two critical facts: one, that fully suppressing the virus with antiretroviral treatment eliminates sexual transmission risk in addition to extending life expectancy nearly to normal, and two, that when HIV-negative people take the antiretrovirals Truvada or Descovy daily as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, they reduce their risk of contracting the virus by 99% or more. Accordingly, the nations that have succeeded in far besting the U.S. in reducing new infections have gotten more people with HIV diagnosed and on treatment, and have done so sooner in the course of infection. These countries have also often seen a greater proportion of those at the highest risk of HIV, namely gay men, get on PrEP. An estimated 1.2 million Americans have HIV. According to the CDC, only 87% of them are diagnosed and just 58% are in treatment and have a fully suppressed viral load. This latter figure compares with robust national viral suppression rates, estimated by health authorities, of 82% in Australia, 83% in the Netherlands, 89% in the U.K and 74% in Italy. The rate is higher than 70% in at least 16 other European nations. In the U.S., the virus has maintained its vastly disproportionate impact on gay and bisexual men, who, according to the new CDC report, comprise about 70% of new cases despite making up only about 2% of the adult population. First approved in 2012, PrEP has soared in popularity among white gay men in the U.S., while failing to gain a major foothold among their Black and Latino peers. The CDC has estimated that about 814,000 gay and bisexual men are good PrEP candidates. Recent data suggested that the number of people, overwhelmingly from this population, who have ever used PrEP each year more than doubled between 2017 and 2022, to at least 318,400. However, a recent CDC study suggested that only about half that group took PrEP during any one month last year, suggesting that many people take it only temporarily. The most recent four-year national decline was driven by an estimated one-third drop in cases among 13- to 24-year-olds, which Dr. Robyn Neblett Fanfair, acting director of the CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, characterized as “very encouraging” on a Tuesday media call. The CDC attributes this success to progress in expanding testing, treatment and PrEP among gay and bisexual males, who comprised 80% of the cases in that age group. But infection rates among these men’s older counterparts have remained statistically stable. In England, vastly improved biomedical prevention among gay and bisexual men slashed their HIV diagnosis rate so drastically — by about three-quarters in a decade — that in 2022, fewer of them tested positive for the virus than heterosexuals. In the U.S., gay and bisexual men’s transmissions outnumber heterosexuals’ by more than three to one. Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Duke University Global Health Institute, remarked that many of the nations that have seen such precipitous declines “don’t have to deal with the really sharp health disparities and lack of access” that have colored the U.S. HIV fight. HIV has for decades exposed racial and socioeconomic fault lines in the U.S., with the virus disproportionately affecting people of color and the poor. Blacks and Latinos comprised a respective 40% and 29% of the most recent transmissions, despite these racial groups making up only 12% and 19% of the U.S. population. Approximately one in five new infections are among women, more than half of them among Black women. The new CDC report reveals that such racial disparities have abated only slightly in recent years. Breaking down the transmission trajectory by race and sex showed that Black men were the only group to see a statistically significant reduction. Estimated new infections among gay and bisexual men declined between 2017 and 2021 from 9,300 to 8,100 among Blacks and 7,800 to 7,200 among Latinos. However, these changes were not statistically significant, in contrast to the significant decline among whites, from 5,800 to 4,800 cases. Conservative politicians’ recent fervent use of anti-LGBTQ legislation and rhetoric to appeal to the Republican base threatens to further undermine efforts to combat HIV, public health experts warned. “All of this plain hatred at the LGBTQ community is not good for ending the epidemic,” Kathie Hiers, CEO of AIDS Alabama, said. Hiers also decried what she characterized as insufficient and poorly coordinated national support for housing among those living with and at risk for HIV. She pointed to the robust support New York provides HIV-positive homeless people as a pillar of that state’s success in fighting the virus. About half of HIV transmissions occur in the South, which has an infection rate approximately 50% higher than in the West and Northeast, and double that of the Midwest. Southern states, dominated by Republicans, have tended to devote fewer resources to combatting the virus compared with liberal states, and cities elsewhere, such as San Francisco and New York, that have a history of beating back substantial HIV epidemics. Experts have long cited the refusal of most Southern legislatures to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act as a major driver of regional disparities in HIV treatment and prevention. “Medicaid expansion is a massive structural intervention to support the most vulnerable in our communities,” said Dr. Hyman Scott, an HIV prevention expert at the San Francisco Department of Public Health. There is hope that the South may be turning a corner, given the CDC’s finding that it was the only region to see a statistically significant decline — of 12% — in estimated new HIV infections between 2017 and 2021. Additionally, HIV’s decline appears to be accelerating, however marginally. The CDC previously reported the new infection rate was essentially stable during the mid-2010s and then inched 8% lower between 2015 and 2019. And while the most recent data are somewhat hazy due to a drop in HIV testing following Covid-19’s onset, an apparent sustained decline in transmissions in 2020 and 2021 represents a victory for the HIV treatment and prevention workforce. Infectious disease clinics, for example, often proved nimble in the face of the new pandemic’s disruptions by pivoting to telehealth and supplying patients with months of medications at a time. The CDC isn’t satisfied. “In prevention, patience is not a virtue,” Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, said during the Tuesday media call. “We can end HIV in America. We know the way, but does our nation have the will?” The federal government is hoping that a surge in spending will be the linchpin that finally sends the HIV epidemic into a swift retreat. In 2019, Donald Trump endorsed a plan to ratchet up federal outlays on HIV. Between the 2020 and 2023 fiscal years, this infusion of new annual funds, largely funneled to the 48 counties where about half of transmissions occur, has soared from $267 million to $573 million. Mermin called for Congress to approve President Biden’s budget request of $850 million for the 2024 fiscal year. The expressed aim of the spending is to cause the 2017 HIV transmission rate to collapse 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030. But as CDC surveillance quite evidently shows, the epidemic’s current trajectory is nowhere near on track to achieve such lofty goals. Emory’s Boghuma Titanji said that to succeed in beating HIV, the nation must address the myriad intractable social inequities that drive transmission, including poverty, racism, stigma, homophobia, homelessness and poor health care access. Absent such progress, Titanji said, she anticipates that by the decade’s end, HIV in the U.S. will be “pretty much the same: a disease that will continue to disproportionately impact the most vulnerable communities.” "
"60,000 pounds of an explosive chemical lost during rail shipment, officials say",Julianne McShane,"May 22, 2023, 2:20 PM UTC / Updated May 23, 2023, 12:25 AM UTC",U.S. news,"About 60,000 pounds of a chemical used as both a fertilizer and an explosive is missing after likely disappearing during a rail trip from Wyoming to California last month, according to federal records. A rail car carrying ammonium nitrate left a plant operated by explosives manufacturer Dyno Nobel in Cheyenne, Wyoming, on April 12, according to an incident report filed May 10 by a representative of the company with the National Response Center. The report states the chemical was released ""due to an unknown cause,"" and was discovered missing after the rail car arrived in Saltdale, California, an unincorporated community more than 1,000 miles from Cheyenne. At the time of the report, the car was empty and on its way back to Wyoming, according to the company. Ammonium nitrate has been a key ingredient in both terror attacks and fatal accidents. At least 581 people were killed in 1947 when more than 2,000 tons of the chemical exploded on a cargo ship that had docked at a port in Texas City, Texas. The same year, in Brest, France, a Norwegian ship that contained about 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate exploded, leading to 29 deaths. It was also used in a 1970 bombing on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus that led to one death and several injuries, and in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people. In 2013, ammonium nitrate was the cause of an explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, killing 15 people, injuring 200 and wiping out hundreds of homes. Federal officials later found the blast was a “criminal act.” In 2020, it was the source of a colossal explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, when more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated, killing more than 200 people and injuring thousands. “It’s a very common chemical that anybody that has used fertilizer has dealt with routinely and doesn’t think anything about it,” said Nathan Lewis, a chemistry professor at the California Institute of Technology, told NBC News following the Beirut explosion. “Just give it a little fuel, and you’re asking for trouble, and that’s what apparently happened,” Lewis said of the incident in Lebanon. But a California law enforcement source familiar with the case told NBC News the recent disappearance of the chemical does not appear to be connected to any domestic terrorism threat. The agencies that would examine a potential threat to homeland security are not among the main investigative agencies involved in the case, the source said. A representative for the National Transportation Safety Board did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FBI also did not have any immediate comment. A spokesperson for the Federal Railroad Administration said that Union Pacific's ""initial findings suggest this was likely a leak caused by a component of the rail car."" ""Rail shippers and railroads are responsible for ensuring rail cars are properly secured and the FRA will continue investigating to determine if the railroad or shipper committed any federal violations under DOT’s regulatory authority,"" the FRA spokesperson added. The spokesperson added that Union Pacific and Dyno Nobel ""should engage all necessary parties, including law enforcement, to ensure any potential causes and impacts are addressed swiftly and thoroughly."" Representatives for Dyno Nobel and the California Public Utilities Commission did not respond to requests. Kristen South, a spokesperson for Union Pacific, the rail company  transporting the chemical, said in a statement that the disappearance of the chemical should not threaten the public. ""The fertilizer is designed for ground application and quick soil absorption. If the loss resulted from a railcar leak over the course of transportation from origin to destination, the release should pose no risk to public health or the environment,"" South said, adding that the company's investigation into the incident “is in its early stages.” ""At this point in the investigation, we do not believe there is any criminal or malicious activity involved,"" South added. A representative for Dyno Nobel told KQED, the California news outlet that first reported the incident, that company representatives believe the chemical leaked through the rail car while in transit. “The railcar was sealed when it left the Cheyenne facility, and the seals were still intact when it arrived in Saltdale. The initial assessment is that a leak through the bottom gate on the railcar may have developed in transit,” the spokesperson told KQED. The route, which spans more than 1,000 miles through long stretches of remote territory in the western United States, will make it somewhat challenging to pinpoint the missing cargo or how it may have been released, sources said.

"If bird flu starts to spread among people, existing vaccines may be inadequate, experts say",Aria Bendix,"May 21, 2023, 10:30 AM UTC",Health news,"Wild birds and poultry flocks alike continue to drop dead from the highly pathogenic bird flu that began spreading globally in 2020. Almost 59 million commercial birds have already been culled in the United States. It’s the broadest outbreak of this type of avian flu, known as H5N1, since it was first identified in China in 1996. The virus's proliferation and high fatality rate have prompted questions about two types of possible vaccines: those for birds and those for humans. H5N1 kills almost all the birds it infects; among reported cases in people since 2003, the death rate has been 56%. The U.S. Agriculture Department announced in April that it had started testing several vaccine candidates for poultry. Vaccines for people, meanwhile, would only be considered if the virus eventually undergoes a complicated string of mutations that allow it to spread from person to person. There’s no evidence of that yet. The U.S. recorded its only human case of H5N1 last April — the person was involved in culling poultry with presumed infections in Colorado. The United Kingdom reported two cases Tuesday, both poultry workers with asymptomatic infections detected via routine testing. Chile reported one infection in March and Ecuador one case in January. But scientists have long considered H5N1 to have pandemic potential. The U.S. has a stockpile of H5N1 flu shots in case such a crisis arises, but three experts said it would likely prove insufficient should this particular type of avian flu start infecting people. The shots have only been administered in trials and were derived from strains that circulated in 2004 and 2005. ""You would expect that those vaccines based on those older strains would likely offer little protection against what’s circulating today,"" said Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. Developing new, better-tailored shots for the current strain would be complicated, though, because most flu vaccines are grown in chicken eggs — ""a slow process fraught with production issues,"" according to Dr. Gregory Poland, founder and director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. The process requires individually inoculating each egg with a modified virus and, of course, depends on an ample supply of healthy chickens. ""In a real pandemic situation, the poultry will be at threat, and then the supply of the eggs will be highly compromised,"" said Dr. Suresh Mittal, a virology professor at Purdue University. The U.S. does, however, keep a stockpile of chickens to ensure it can continue producing flu vaccines. Better options may be on the horizon. Vaccine researchers are developing shots that could be updated to target whatever mutated strain of H5N1 gains a hold in people someday. But no human trials are underway yet. ""What we need is a library of H5N1 vaccine candidates that are ready to go,"" Poland said, adding, ""we’re putting people and economies at cataclysmic risk by not being prepared."" In general, scientists start to worry about bird flu spilling over to people when there's mammal-to-mammal transmission, Hensley said. Scientists saw evidence of that during an October outbreak in minks in Spain. “We’re afraid that those kind of events will lead to a mutant form of this virus that could transmit among humans,” Hensley said. Since arriving in the U.S. last January, avian flu has spread from birds to several other mammals: mountain lions, bobcats, bears, seals, red foxes, coyotes, raccoons, skunks and possums, as well as an otter and a bottlenose dolphin. Poland compared these infections to “the rumbles prior to an earthquake."" He suggested that a bird flu pandemic would most likely start as a small outbreak among poultry workers or swine workers, since pigs can pass the virus from birds to humans. Such an outbreak might be contained right away, he said — or not. So vaccine researchers are preparing. Moderna said that later this year, it expects to begin clinical testing of an mRNA vaccine specific to the strain now circulating in birds, called 2.3.4.4b. mRNA technology offers an advantage because it allows vaccines to be produced and updated quickly. Given that experts think a future bird flu pandemic would be caused by a strain of H5N1 that hasn’t evolved yet, the ideal vaccines could be easily tweaked to target it. Hensley leads a research team that is testing another mRNA vaccine to target 2.3.4.4b. Data published in April, which hasn’t been peer reviewed, showed that it elicited an immune response in mice and ferrets. ""Making a vaccine that looks like what’s circulating right now gives us a higher chance of having cross-protection against something slightly different, but very related,"" Poland said. Meanwhile, two other pharmaceutical companies, CSL Seqirus and GSK, have partnered with the U.S. government to manufacture experimental vaccine doses that are also closer matches to the current strain. GSK's trial is set to begin this year, but the company did not specific the type of technology it uses. CSL Seqirus said a phase 2 trial to assess the safety and immune response of an inactivated virus vaccine is scheduled to start in June. Mittal said a universal flu vaccine, which would target a wide variety of flu strains, could also provide cross-protection against whatever version of bird flu one day finds its way into humans. Several such vaccines are being developed, but none has advanced to a late-stage trial. The National Institutes of Health announced this month that it has started testing a universal mRNA flu vaccine among 50 volunteers. The Health and Human Services Department declined to specify the quantity or manufacturers of the bird flu vaccine products in the national stockpile. However, NBC News verified that three approved H5N1 vaccines have been stockpiled, two of which are produced using eggs. One of those shots, from the pharmaceutical company Sanofi, was approved for adults in 2007. In a trial of around 100 people, two doses elicited a protective immune response in 45% of the recipients, according to the Food and Drug Administration. As of 2007, the U.S. had stockpiled enough of that vaccine for 6 million people. When tested against strains circulating in 2016 and 2017, the vaccine prompted a modest antibody response, according to a 2019 study. However, a dose is 90 micrograms — much bigger than the seasonal flu vaccine. In a pandemic situation, that could make it challenging to quickly manufacture shots for everyone who needs them, Poland said. ""You have to produce the equivalent of six normal doses for one dose of that H5N1 vaccine,"" he said. ""Those become real numbers when you're talking about tens and hundreds of millions of people."" The FDA approved a second shot for adults in 2013, manufactured by a GSK subsidiary, to add to the stockpile. The company said in 2006 that two doses produced a strong immune response in 80% of the recipients. A GSK spokesperson said the company was awarded contracts last year with the U.S., Canada, the European Union and the World Health Organization to supply its vaccine in the event of a flu pandemic. Under those agreements, the spokesperson said, the company could provide at least 200 million doses to governments around the world. The third stockpiled shot, from CSL Seqirus, was approved in 2020 for recipients ages 6 months and older. It's grown in cultured cells instead of eggs. The company said the U.S. has stockpiled millions of doses' worth of bulk antigen — the ingredient in the vaccine that stimulates an immune response — targeting a variety of strains. In the event of a bird flu pandemic, any of those antigens found to cross-react with circulating strains could be formulated into doses, it said. The company added that it could produce 150 million doses within six months. But Poland said even these pledges from manufacturers would still fall short of the Biden administration's National Biodefense Strategy, which aims to produce enough vaccine for the entire U.S. within roughly four months of a future pandemic's onset.

"Small, rural communities are becoming abortion access battlegrounds",Jazmin Orozco Rodriguez | KFF Health News,"May 21, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Abortion Rights,"WEST WENDOVER, Nev. — In April, Mark Lee Dickson arrived in this 4,500-person city that hugs the Utah-Nevada border to pitch an ordinance banning abortion. Dickson is the director of the anti-abortion group Right to Life of East Texas and founder of another organization that has spent the last few years traveling the United States trying to convince local governments to pass abortion bans. “Sixty-five cities and two counties across the United States” have passed similar restrictions, he told members of the West Wendover City Council during a mid-April meeting. The majority are in Texas, but recent successes in other states have buoyed Dickson and his group. “We’re doing this in Virginia and Illinois and Montana and other places as well,” he said. The quest to enact local bans has become particularly acute in small towns, like West Wendover and Hobbs, N.M., which are situated by borders between states that have restricted abortion and states where laws preserve access. They are crossroads where abortion advocates and providers have looked to establish clinics to serve people traveling from the large swaths of the U.S. where states have banned or severely restricted abortions after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned nearly 50-year-old nationwide abortion protections established by the court’s decision in Roe v. Wade. Residents and leaders in West Wendover and many other towns and cities are grappling with the arrival of outside advocates, including Dickson, who now claim a stake in the governance of their small and otherwise quiet communities. Dickson’s proposal to the West Wendover City Council came after council members voted against issuing a building permit to California-based Planned Parenthood Mar Monte in March. Officials from the Planned Parenthood affiliate told the local board the facility would offer primary care services in addition to abortion and other reproductive care. The vote followed hours of heated debate during public comment. Then, Mayor Jasie Holm vetoed the council’s decision, leaving the request for the permit in limbo. Located in northeastern Nevada, West Wendover is more than 100 miles by car from Elko, the county seat, 120 miles west from Salt Lake City, and 170 miles south from Twin Falls, Idaho. The city has been a strategic location for casinos and a marijuana dispensary, which are legal in Nevada but restricted in Utah and Idaho. Similarly, its proximity to states that moved to restrict abortion access following the Dobbs decision overturning Roe has put a spotlight on the city. Dickson’s anti-abortion proposal has drawn support from the town’s more conservative residents. But brothers Fernando and Marcos Cerros have challenged the anti-abortion efforts. In addition to wanting to protect and expand access to abortion, they both saw the primary care clinic that Planned Parenthood Mar Monte was seeking to establish as a potential victory in their rural community, which is designated a medically underserved area by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. Fernando Cerros, 22, said Planned Parenthood offered a solution to the area’s health care shortage “on a silver platter.” “And it was denied. I need to do what I can do to get it here,” he said. The Cerros brothers have tried to organize a group to support abortion access and establish the Planned Parenthood clinic in West Wendover, but have found it difficult to sustain. They said they feel outnumbered by residents who support Dickson. Marcos Cerros, 18, said he attends Catholic mass every Sunday in West Wendover and that parishioners there are regularly exposed to inflammatory anti-abortion language. Abortion up to 24 weeks is protected in Nevada law and the state legislature recently approved a bill to enshrine the law in the state constitution. To become law, the measure will need to pass once more during Nevada’s next legislative session, in 2025, and be approved by voters in 2026. Last year, following the Dobbs decision, then-Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, issued an executive order similar to ones in other states protecting patients who seek abortion care from facing prosecution by states where it is not legal. Across Nevada’s eastern border, in Utah, abortion is legal up to 18 weeks while challenges to a trigger ban and a move to clamp down on abortion clinic licensure continue through the courts. Idaho’s laws against abortion are among the most restrictive in the country. Currently, the state allows abortion only in certain cases of rape and incest or to save the mother’s life. In April, the state made headlines after lawmakers there passed an “abortion trafficking” law that criminalizes helping minors cross state borders to receive an abortion or obtain abortion pills without parental consent. Extreme variations in abortion policy from state to state are the new normal, and local challenges are “what we’re in for,” said Rachel Rebouché, dean of the Beasley School of Law at Temple University and co-author of a recent research paper examining the post-Dobbs legal reality. “The theaters of conflict are multiplying, and this is the complex legal landscape that we live in.” Dickson’s strategy in creating what he calls “sanctuary cities for the unborn” involves invoking a 150-year-old federal law that restricts the mailing of abortion pills. But Dickson argues the law goes further, banning any “paraphernalia,” including anything that could be used to perform an abortion, such as certain medical devices and tools. Federal officials contend that although the abortion provision in the law has not been amended, previous court decisions have limited the reach of the Comstock Act. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion in December concluding that the law does not prohibit the mailing of abortion medication. Dickson argues that the Comstock Act should supersede any state law or state constitutional protection. Rebouché said she’s unsure how it will shake out in the courts. “There’s a number of jumps a court would have to take, the most significant of which would be that Comstock is still good law and it preempts abortion law,” she said. “That’s a controversial holding because Comstock has not been enforced or applied for decades.” A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Mar Monte declined to comment on whether the organization would continue to pursue the clinic in West Wendover, citing legal issues. Dickson’s proposal now sits in the hands of the West Wendover City Council. He assured local leaders that, should they proceed with implementing the ordinance, his attorney will represent them at no cost. That attorney, Jonathan Mitchell, is a former solicitor general of Texas and is credited with helping shape the law that allows civil lawsuits against people and providers “aiding and abetting” pregnant women terminating a pregnancy. An anti-abortion ordinance was walked back in at least one Ohio city, and other local bodies have voted against such ordinances or chosen not to put them to a vote, according to Dickson’s website. Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, said there’s an irony in Dickson’s multistate effort to stop people from crossing state lines for reproductive health care, including abortion. “It would be laughable if it were not so tragic,” Miller said. “It’s an incredibly cynical, politically motivated effort largely aimed at sowing confusion and stigmatizing abortion care.” Miller also pointed to other municipalities in the U.S. — urban centers like New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and more — that have approved local ordinances protecting and expanding access to abortion care. The West Wendover city manager, mayor, or council members would need to request that consideration of the proposal be added to a meeting agenda for it to move forward. Holm, the mayor, said she would not include the ordinance for consideration “at any time.” City Council member Gabriela Soriano, the only woman on the council, said in late April that she was unsure whether other council members would pursue the ordinance. Holm said she was unaware of any outreach to the city from Planned Parenthood Mar Monte about moving forward with the clinic. If the anti-abortion ordinance in West Wendover were instituted and prevented the opening of a clinic in the city, it would have far-reaching implications for residents. Currently, they face more than an hour drive in either direction to the nearest hospital. For some community members, the decision isn’t so clear-cut. The Cerros brothers said their mother, who is Catholic and Hispanic, is against abortion but in support of the Planned Parenthood clinic opening in West Wendover. Years ago, she had a miscarriage after driving an hour and a half to Salt Lake City for emergency care. “There’s a big divide between people who think you’re killing babies versus people who think pregnancy is not black and white. Things come up,” Fernando Cerros said. “Sometimes you need emergency care. And a clinic like that would help.” KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

"Weight loss drugs can lead to muscle loss, too. Is that a bad thing?",Kaitlin Sullivan,"May 20, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC / Updated May 21, 2023, 12:57 AM UTC",Health news,"Weight loss drugs have soared in popularity in the past year, helping some lose dramatic amounts of weight — but not all that weight is fat. Some of that is actually lean mass, which is everything in the body that isn’t fat, including your bones, organs and, importantly, muscle. “When we look at weight reduction from any intervention, about one-third of the weight we lose tends to be lean mass, and that can be problematic,” said Dr. Jaime Almandoz, an associate professor of internal medicine in the Division of Endocrinology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. That lean mass loss is generally from muscle. “Lean mass is healthier and associated with better metabolism, so when we lose lean mass, we may lose some of that function.” The more muscle mass a person has, the better the resting metabolic rate, or the number of calories a person burns at rest. When a person loses muscle mass, the resting metabolic rate decreases, too. “If you can maintain your muscle mass, you could have more sustained weight loss because your metabolic rate would not be reduced,” said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. Two drugs in particular have taken off for weight loss: semaglutide and tirzepatide. Semaglutide is the drug found in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy; tirzepatide is the drug in Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro. The medications work in slightly different ways, but both suppress appetite, causing people to consume fewer calories. Losing weight has complex effects on the body, especially during the initial phases. The more weight a person loses during a short period of time, the more muscle mass they’ll lose in addition to fat, Almandoz said. When the body isn’t getting as much energy from food, it pulls from reserves of energy stored as fat and muscle, starting primarily with fat. While it’s normal for some of this extra energy to be pulled from muscle, the body may need to pull more energy from muscle if a person is losing a significant amount of weight quickly, such as 5 to 10 pounds a week instead of around 2 pounds. “That’s why we try to emphasize slow, consistent weight loss rather than quick weight loss, where you’re more likely to pull from your energy stores” in muscle, said Dr. Jonathan Purnell, an endocrinologist and professor of medicine at the Oregon Health and Science University Knight Cardiovascular Institute in Portland. Purnell has done consulting work for Novo Nordisk, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “It’s also a function of how low you go,” he said. “Once you enter into the healthy BMI range, you’re more likely to be pulling from the lean stores.” Despite concerns about muscle mass loss, at the end of the dramatic weight loss period, people may actually have a healthier body composition, that is, the ratio of lean mass — especially muscle —compared to fat. “While lean mass loss is concerning, at the end, you may actually end up with a little more lean mass compared to other components such as body fat,” said Almandoz, who has worked as a consultant for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. That’s important because “the damage from obesity doesn’t come from increased muscle, it comes from increased fat mass, particularly in the abdomen,” according to Aronne, who is a consultant for Eli Lilly. Figuring out how to lose fat but not muscle would be the “holy grail” of weight loss, he said. A 2021 clinical trial that tested the weight loss effects of Wegovy found that while about 40% of the weight people lost tended to be lean mass, including muscle, at the end of 68 weeks, people who took the drug had a lower risk of heart disease and better physical function compared to a placebo group. “Although lean body mass, which includes muscle mass, decreased in absolute terms, the proportion of lean body mass relative to total body mass increased,” Allison Schneider, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, said in an email. Studies showed similar results for the drug tirzepatide, which is sold under the brand name Mounjaro. In a phase 3 clinical trial, “a reduction in lean mass was reported at a similar rate as what is seen in lifestyle-based treatments for obesity,” Jessica Thompson, a spokesperson for tirzepatide-maker Eli Lilly, said in an emailed statement. A new analysis of data from the same trial found that after 72 weeks of taking the drug, about 25% of the weight participants lost was lean mass. However, the participants had an overall healthier body composition. Aronne, who worked on the trial, presented the findings this week at the European Congress on Obesity in Dublin. The analysis has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. There are ways to mitigate lean mass loss during weight loss, and people older than 60 who are already more prone to muscle loss need to be particularly mindful of building muscle, said Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. One way is to make sure you’re eating enough protein, which can be difficult to do while using weight loss drugs. Protein is the building block of muscle; without enough of it, muscles aren’t able to build and repair themselves. People should aim to get 60 to 80 grams of protein every day, which can be difficult to do through diet alone, Purnell said. Simonetti said she recommends looking for protein supplements, such as protein powders, that are low in sugar and have at least 20 grams of protein per serving. Exercise, specifically resistance training, is also a critical part of maintaining muscle mass during weight loss, she said. Complicating matters is that it’s difficult to determine whether you are losing weight from fat or muscle without special equipment. That’s why people on these drugs should stay in close contact with their health care team, Simonetti said. If you’re losing weight at a rapid pace, you are likely losing muscle mass, as well. “People should have a medical team involved when they use these drugs so they can monitor not only muscle loss, but also kidney function, salt and electrolytes,” all of which can be thrown off by dramatic weight loss, she said. Nausea — a common side effect of weight loss drugs — can also indicate acute kidney failure if a person isn’t drinking enough water, she added. There are currently no guidelines for physicians counseling patients on weight loss drugs. For now, many doctors, including Purnell, base their recommendations on guidelines for bariatric surgery patients, since the weight loss effects of surgery are comparable to those seen with the new weight loss drugs. Almandoz said that since the drugs can cause dramatic weight loss, physicians need research-backed recommendations about whether or not they should tell people on the drugs to take extra vitamins or other nutrients. It’s also unclear how these recommendations may be different for older people. “There are a lot of unknowns with these medications but we do know that they are effective and they do bring metabolic benefits and improvements in quality of life,” he said. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

North Carolina’s abortion law may make traveling to end a pregnancy impossible for some in the South,Aria Bendix,"May 20, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC",Abortion Rights,"As lawmakers in North and South Carolina work to impose new restrictions on abortion, options for women seeking to end a pregnancy in the South are diminishing quickly. In North Carolina, a ban on abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy goes into effect on July 1. Gov. Roy Cooper had vetoed the legislation, but the state's Republican-led Assembly voted Tuesday to override that veto. Also on Tuesday, the South Carolina House of Representatives approved a six-week abortion ban, which now advances to the state Senate. And last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would ban most abortions after six weeks. The law will take effect if Florida's Supreme Court upholds its current 15-week ban in an ongoing legal challenge. ""We’re going to see many people forced to continue pregnancies against their will,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder and CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, which operates two abortion clinics in Virginia, along with clinics in Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota and New Mexico. Miller said she was bracing for more women who are seeking abortions to travel to Virginia, which will likely soon be the last Southern state without abortion restrictions. North Carolina’s ban makes exceptions for rape, incest and “life-limiting” fetal anomalies. Proponents of the legislation argue that it offers a compromise on abortion. ""The things in this bill are not obstacles to abortion. They’re safeguards. We seek to balance protecting unborn babies while ensuring the safe care of mothers,"" North Carolina House Speaker Pro Tempore Sarah Stevens said in floor remarks Tuesday night. Even before North Carolina's 12-week ban passed, Miller said her Virginia clinics were seeing patients from across the South. Since January, her call center has received more than 6,000 phone calls from people out of state seeking care in Virginia, she said. Not all of those people make it to her clinics: Miller said that every day, a patient cancels an appointment, often after multiple attempts to reschedule, because of factors that prevent the patient from traveling, such as a child getting sick or a ride falling through. ""They say to us, 'It’s just going be easier for me to have a baby. I can’t figure out how to get there,'"" she said. The time it takes to schedule an appointment and arrange travel also prompts some patients to delay abortions until the second trimester (on average, women don't learn they're pregnant until between five and six weeks' gestation). In many cases, that will entail a surgical abortion, since abortion pills are approved for use only up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. The forthcoming ban in North Carolina could exacerbate those issues, Miller said. Amber Gavin, the vice president of advocacy and operations at A Woman’s Choice, which operates three abortion clinics in North Carolina, said her clinics were already seeing wait times of about 10 days. Gavin said those waits may get longer once the 12-week ban takes effect — even if patient volume decreases — because the new law requires an in-person visit three days before an abortion and mandates that all abortions, even those done using pills, be administered in person. ""It just adds more administrative tasks to our physicians and our medical staff than necessary,"" Gavin said. She added that her North Carolina clinics frequently see patients from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. Come July 1, the clinics will start referring women who are more than 12 weeks pregnant to providers in Virginia, Maryland, Illinois and Washington, D.C., she said. ""It’s just going to have devastating effects to the entire South,"" Gavin said. One remaining option is The Brigid Alliance, a service that provides travel, food, lodging, child care and other logistical support for people seeking abortions across the U.S. Clinics and providers can refer people to the service, which receives funding from private donors. The group's typical client travels more than 1,300 miles round trip and has travel expenses of nearly $1,400. ""A lot of our clients haven’t even left their county,"" said Serra Sippel, the alliance’s interim executive director. ""Many have never been on an airplane before."" In the long term, medical experts and political leaders also fear an exodus of physicians from states with abortion bans, which could limit access to both abortions and maternal health care more broadly in the South. ""The North Carolina ban will harm patients and threaten doctors for providing essential care,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Tuesday. Dr. Catherine Kuhn, associate dean for graduate medical education at Duke University School of Medicine, said residents who are training in obstetrics, gynecology or family medicine will likely need to travel to other states to learn how to administer abortions after 12 weeks. North Carolina might also struggle to attract new medical talent if the state is seen as hostile to reproductive health care, Kuhn added. A survey of medical students, published this week, found that nearly 60% said they were unlikely or very unlikely to apply to a single residency program in a state with abortion restrictions. ""I'm worried that, particularly in women's health and reproductive health care, we'll see a decrease in applications and interest,"" Kuhn said. "
Woman who has refused tuberculosis treatment found in contempt of court as she remains at large,Tim Stelloh,"May 18, 2023, 8:38 PM UTC / Updated May 19, 2023, 9:11 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A Washington state woman who has repeatedly refused a judge’s order to take medication for tuberculosis remains at large weeks after a rarely used arrest warrant was issued. The woman, identified in court documents as V.N., did not appear at a scheduled court hearing on Friday in Pierce County, south of Seattle. V.N. was found to be in contempt of the court's orders. A warrant for her arrest remains in effect, according to court documents filed on Friday. Once she is arrested, V.N. is ordered to be held at the Pierce County Jail for 45 days to receive testing and treatment for tuberculosis so that she no longer poses a threat to the public, the documents state. A lawyer for the woman did not respond to requests for comment. The next hearing is scheduled for June 23. A spokesman for the county’s public health department declined to comment on the case ahead of the hearing and pointed to a previous statement saying the agency has the legal authority to compel people who pose a public health risk to comply with court orders. A judge signed the warrant for V.N.’s arrest in March, after public health officials said they had asked the judge 16 times to order her to self-isolate or take medication for the illness, described in court filings as an active case of the disease. Tuberculosis often damages the lungs and can be fatal. The disease is spread through the air when people cough or sneeze and can be cured with medication. According to the The News Tribune of Tacoma, legal petitions from the Tacoma-Pierce County Public Health Department said V.N. had at one point started taking medication but then stopped. V.N.’s condition isn’t clear. A May 10 petition from the department said an officer with the agency believes V.N. is still infected with the bacteria. A court document filed last month showed that a sheriff’s deputy who had been surveilling the woman after the warrant was issued saw her boarding a bus to a casino. The surveillance was revealed in a declaration filed with Pierce County Superior Court by Patricia Jackson, chief of the county’s corrections bureau. Jackson said the deputy had been tasked with surveilling V.N. to execute the warrant “in a safe manner.” She did not say why V.N. wasn’t arrested or why she told the officer to stop watching V.N. Sgt. Darren Moss, a spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, confirmed on Thursday that V.N. was not yet in custody but has declined to comment further on the case, saying his office “won’t comment on how we conduct surveillance, when we do it or when we will attempt to make an arrest until after that person is in custody.” In another May 10 court filing, a legal assistant with the Tacoma-Pierce County Public Health Department said a person who identified himself as V.N.’s son called the office and asked if his mother had missed a court hearing. He also asked for the next hearing date and for her lawyer’s information, according to the filing. Nearly 100,000 cases of tuberculosis were recorded annually in the United States in the early 1950s. By 2021, that number had declined to 7,882, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pierce County sees roughly 20 active cases of the disease annually, according to the local public health department. "
CDC reports another death linked to recalled eyedrops,Erika Edwards,"May 19, 2023, 3:16 PM UTC / Updated May 19, 2023, 5:19 PM UTC",Health news,"The number of people with highly drug-resistant bacterial infections linked to contaminated eyedrops has reached 81, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday. The 81 cases, up from 68 identified in March, include 14 people who have been blinded and four others who had to have their eyeballs surgically removed. Though most infections have been limited to the eyes, the bacteria can be fatal when it enters the bloodstream. As of Monday, the CDC said, four people have died. ""These were catastrophic and life-altering infections,"" Maroya Spalding Walters, who leads the CDC's antimicrobial resistance team, said in an interview. Though many patients said they’d used multiple brands of eyedrops, EzriCare Artificial Tears was found to be a common brand among those infected. Opened bottles of the EzriCare eyedrops were also found to harbor the same bacteria found in samples taken from patients. The EzriCare products were manufactured by Global Pharma Healthcare in India and sold mostly online. The CDC and FDA said people should stop using them, as well as two other eye products made by the same manufacturer: Delsam Pharma’s Artificial Tears and Delsam Pharma’s Artificial Eye Ointment. The CDC expects the case count to rise, although the rate has slowed since Global Pharma recalled all three of those products in February. The infections come from a specific strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria that has proven difficult, if not impossible in many cases, to control with standard antibiotics. Before last year, this particular form of the bacteria had never been reported in the United States. Now, cases have been discovered in 18 states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. The initial infections started popping up last year. Cases were first investigated in Connecticut early last summer. Doctors in Miami started seeing such infections late last summer. An Ohio woman became infected in November. Some cases occurred among clusters of people living in long-term care facilities, the CDC said, even among patients who never used artificial tears. Sometimes, the bacteria can enter a person's body through the eyes via the eyedrops but never affect the eyes. Those bacteria can then set up shop in the body, colonizing in the respiratory or digestive systems for months without making the person sick. That bacteria, however, can be transmitted to others through shared medical equipment, for example. The Food and Drug Administration has also been leading an investigation into the contaminated drops. But the agency's last update on the matter was Feb. 22. The FDA did not respond to requests from NBC News for a more recent update. Both the CDC and FDA have urged consumers to stop using any of the recalled products. ""Make sure that these recalled products are not still present, aren't hiding on a shelf,"" Spalding Walters said. ""Anytime a product is recalled, there's always a chance that it's going to be still in homes and be used months or years down the road."" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
"Young Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults have the highest cancer death rates, research shows",Kimmy Yam,"May 19, 2023, 2:01 PM UTC",Asian America,"New research shows that Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders between the ages of 20 and 49 have the highest death rates from any type of cancer among all racial groups of that age bracket. The findings, published last month by the National Cancer Institute, weren’t immediately apparent in previous research because federal data has traditionally grouped together those of Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander descent, concealing the disparities, the report said. “We have shown the importance of disaggregating Asian and NHPI individuals, as these groups have disparate cancer mortality rates that are hidden when analyzed together,” researchers wrote. “Policies aimed at equitable cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment, as well as disaggregation of data for racial/ethnic subpopulations are needed to address disparities in cancer mortality across racial/ethnic groups.” Those of Asian descent, the manuscript pointed out, have the lowest cancer death rates across every age group and, when combined with data on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, the death rate largely ended up reflecting the low incidence of the disease among Asian Americans While the Office of Management and Budget disaggregated the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations from Asian Americans in 1997, the National Center for Health Statistics didn’t release single-race mortality data until almost two decades later, when all states implemented the new classification on death certificates, the report said. Therefore, data on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, who represent an estimated 0.4% of the U.S. population, remained “masked.” The report, which also looked at cancer death rates across other racial groups, showed additional disparities. Data on cancer mortality rates among males showed Black men with the highest numbers, followed by whites and Latinos. In looking at women, the mortality rates were highest among Black women. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women came second, followed by white females. High cancer death rates in Black, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities are likely  due in part to unequal access to health care, the report said. Marginalized communities are also more likely to receive “suboptimal” cancer treatment that may not be consistent with the recommended clinical practice guidelines, and are less likely to be included in clinical trials, the report noted. Structural racism was another underlying cause of the racial and ethnic gaps in health. The American Cancer Society’s guidelines for cancer prevention, the researchers point out, focus on “modifiable lifestyle factors” like obesity and physical activity. However, Black, Latino, American Inuit, American Indian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities, which have high obesity rates, are more likely to live in communities with food deserts, high rates of economic insecurity and greater barriers to physical activity. The legacy of U.S. colonization of Hawaii and the long history of “Western interference” has also contributed to health disparities among the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations, Dr. Loïc Le Marchand, associate director for population sciences at the University of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center, told NBC News. “If we compare Polynesians in the South Pacific and Native Hawaiians, not only is the level of obesity higher [in Native Hawaiians], but the type of obesity is different,” Le Marchand said. “The distribution of fat is different. … It’s not just linked to eating more, but it’s also linked to composition of diet.” More disaggregated data and better information on specific populations are critical, Le Marchand said, as they can make a difference in the  decision-making.  And while there are some programs in place in Hawaii and across the country that address these gaps in health care, they are still limited. “Native Hawaiians have been disadvantaged, understudied ... for many decades,” Le Marchand said. “Those health issues exist and need to be addressed.” Le Marchand said that when it comes to treating Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations and other marginalized groups, it’s “not just funding a program here and there.” Integrating leaders from these communities is critical to dispense appropriate care and treatment, he said.

"Abortion bans could drive away young doctors, new survey finds",Erika Edwards,"May 18, 2023, 9:01 PM UTC",Abortion Rights,"Medical students say strict abortion laws are driving them away from pursuing careers as doctors in states where the procedure is banned. The finding comes from a survey of third- and fourth-year medical students, conducted from August through October of last year — just after the June 2022 Supreme Court Dobbs decision that overturned Roe V. Wade, which for nearly 50 years granted the right to an abortion across the U.S. The reluctance to be a medical resident — young doctors who train in hospitals or clinics after graduating medical school — in states with abortion bans could further strain health care shortages in many parts of the country. The survey results reflect the feelings of future obstetricians and gynecologists as well as doctors who plan to go into other specialties, such as surgery or internal medicine, said Ariana Traub, a third-year medical student at Emory University School of Medicine, who conducted the survey. ""The most significant data that we found was that the changes as a result of Dobbs would impact"" where in the U.S. medical students would apply to residency, Traub said. Most respondents, 57.9%, were unlikely or very unlikely to apply to a single residency program in a state with abortion restrictions. The findings, scheduled for presentation this weekend at an annual meeting of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have the ""potential to shift the geographical makeup of health care,"" Traub and her fellow researchers wrote. The survey included responses from 494 medical students in 32 states. Most were women. More than three-quarters, 76.9%, said that access to abortion care would influence where they would pursue their residency. The U.S. is already facing a major shortage of between 37,800 and 124,000 doctors in the coming years, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges. Most concerning for women's health, separate AAMC data found a significant drop in the number of med students pursuing OB/GYN residencies in states with strong abortion policies. The decrease for OB-GYN residency applications, 5.2%, was seen in all states, regardless of abortion laws. That percentage dropped by almost double — to a 10.5% decrease — in applications in states with near-total abortion bans. If the surveys bear out, there could be a serious shortage of OB-GYNs in states with the tightest abortion restrictions. These states already tend to have higher maternal and infant mortality rates. ""I worry that this will impact who will want to apply to our state to train,"" said Dr. Beverly Gray, residency director for the Duke University School of Medicine. North Carolina became the latest state this week to tighten abortion restrictions, making them illegal in most cases at 12 weeks gestation or later. Beyond worries about having enough residents in hospitals, Gray said that her medical school program may be forced to send their medical students to other states for adequate OB-GYN training that includes abortion care. ""Abortion care is part of comprehensive obstetric and gynecology care. If you are unable to receive that basic training, the skill, the technique, and the counseling and managing of complex patients, I believe you're inadequately trained,"" Gray, also an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology, said. Ian Peake is leaving his home state of Oklahoma for a similar reason. He graduates medical school Friday from the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine in Tulsa. On Monday, he'll fly to New York City, where he'll begin his OB/GYN residency at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University. Dobbs was the deciding factor in choosing to practice medicine somewhere other than Oklahoma, which last year enacted the strictest abortion ban in the country. ""For me, it was very clear after the Dobbs decision and the subsequent ban in Oklahoma that this is not the place I would like to train,"" Peake said, preferring instead a residency in a state where he can legally ""practice the full range of health care when it comes to OB/GYN."" Nell Mermin-Bunnell, a third-year medical student at Emory School of Medicine who was also involved with the new survey, explained that procedures to carry out abortions are often done in emergency situations to save lives. The vast majority of procedures done in the second or third term ""are medical emergencies, where either the fetus is no longer viable, and it is dangerous for the pregnant patient to continue carrying the pregnancy, or the pregnant patient is medically unstable, and it is dangerous to their long-term health or to their life,"" Mermin-Bunnell said. ""This happens terrifyingly often."" ""It is hard to walk into work every day and be told that you can't provide the care that might save a patient's life,"" Gray, of Duke University School of Medicine, said. ""There's tremendous moral injury with being put in that situation, to be asked to care for people and not allowed to do the right thing."" Many of the surveyed students are in the midst of their child-bearing years, and may be thinking of planning for their own pregnancy. In fact, 72.7% of respondents said that abortion access changes would likely or very likely influence where they would start a family. Traub and Mermin-Bunnell have several more years of medical school before they must decide where to apply for residency, and for which specialty. The Dobbs decision has caused them both to consider careers in OB/GYN. Traub is unsure whether to stay in Georgia, which bans abortion after six weeks gestation, or go home to California, which has fewer restrictions on abortion care. ""Part of me is like, if I leave this state and if other health care professionals leave the state, we're leaving the population that so desperately needs help,"" Traub said. A move back to California would afford her more experience in abortion care for her patients. ""I want to have reproductive health care for myself or my eventual family that I may have,"" she said.

1 in 5 older adults skipped or delayed medications last year because of cost,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"May 18, 2023, 3:02 PM UTC",Health news,"A growing number of older adults say they can’t afford their prescription medications, a study published Thursday in JAMA Network Open found. About 1 in 5 adults ages 65 and up either skipped, delayed, took less medication than was prescribed, or took someone else’s medication last year because of concerns about cost, according to the study. “That was pretty surprising,” said lead study author Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. A study published in the journal Medical Care found that in 2016 about 1 in 7 older adults were not taking their medication as prescribed because of cost. “So a pretty big jump,” Dusetzina said. The study’s findings were based on a national survey taken by more than 2,000 older adults from June 2022 through September 2022. Dusetzina attributed the increase to rising inflation and prescription drug costs, which are notoriously high compared to other countries of similar size and wealth. The study may not reflect the experience of younger individuals, she said, although other studies have shown they also struggle to pay for certain medications, like insulin. Sometimes people will keep taking their medication as prescribed despite the cost, but will need to resort to other means — sometimes extreme — to afford the medications, Dusetzina said. About 30% of the older adults used a copayment card or coupon to afford their medication. A quarter of the respondents asked a physician for a lower-cost medication, and about 17% of them shopped around at pharmacies to find a lower price. More than 8% of respondents said they went without basic needs — like gas and groceries — to afford their medication, while 4.8% of respondents said they went into debt to get their medication. The study’s findings are in line with earlier studies as well as what’s seen in the real world, said Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts who advocates for universal health care coverage. He was not involved in the research. “It’s certainly something that any physician has heard in the clinic that patients sometimes don’t take the medication or didn’t fill them or didn’t start them because of the sticker price,” he said. The Inflation Reduction Act — signed into law shortly before the study survey concluded — aims to lower the high cost of prescription drugs for older adults, said Tricia Neuman, executive director for the program on Medicare policy at KFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. On Jan. 1, a provision in the law imposed a $35 monthly out-of-pocket cap on the cost of insulin for older adults on Medicare, causing insulin-makers to quickly follow suit for people on private insurance. But some of the law’s other provisions — like a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on drug spending and negotiated drug pricing — won’t go into effect for several more years. “Future polls will tell us the extent to which further action may be needed to drive down drug prices,” said Neuman, who was not involved in the study. In the meantime, outside groups may need to take action, Gaffney said. Billionaire Mark Cuban last year launched the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co., which offers some generic drugs at discounted prices. A study published last June found that Medicare could have saved nearly $4 billion by purchasing generic drugs at the same prices offered by Cost Plus Drug Co. Dusetzina also said that more physicians should get comfortable speaking with their patients about whether they can afford their medications. Nearly 90% of respondents in the study said they would be open to talking with their doctor about the cost of the drugs. “Physicians worry patients don’t want to talk about it,” she said. “I think one way to normalize these conversations is just to ask people if they want to have them.” Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

FDA panel recommends the first shot to prevent RSV in infants by vaccinating pregnant mothers,Aria Bendix,"May 17, 2023, 7:49 PM UTC",Kids' Health,"An independent advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration voted Thursday to recommend a shot that protects infants from RSV by vaccinating their mothers while pregnant. The 14-person panel unanimously recommended the shot, made by Pfizer, based on its efficacy and voted 10-4 to recommend it based on its safety. If the shot is eventually approved by the FDA, it would be the first vaccine that confers protection against respiratory syncytial virus to babies. “Before the pandemic, RSV was the No. 1 cause of infant hospitalization in the United States, so this is a big deal,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, the director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital. Levy is a temporary voting member of the FDA panel but wasn’t involved in Thursday’s vote. In healthy adults, lower respiratory illness caused by RSV is typically mild, but it can be more severe in babies and older adults. The virus kills up to 300 children under 5 every year in the U.S. and up to 10,000 people ages 65 or older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Severe infections can result in pneumonia or bronchiolitis, which inflames airways and clogs them with mucus. It could take months for the FDA to decide whether to approve the shot, but the agency is likely to follow the advisory committee’s recommendation. The FDA approved the world’s first RSV vaccine this month, made by pharmaceutical giant GSK, but the shot is only for adults ages 60 and up. Pfizer also has an RSV shot for older adults up for FDA approval this month. The FDA advisory panel in late February recommended the shot for people ages 60 and up. It’s the same vaccine that would be given to pregnant people. To protect infants, the shot would be given to pregnant people at 24 to 36 weeks’ gestation; the protective antibodies transfer through the placenta. The committee members generally praised the vaccine’s efficacy but shared reservations about the duration of protection and a potential risk of preterm birth. In a clinical trial with nearly 7,400 participants, the vaccine lowered the risk of severe disease from RSV among infants by 82% within roughly three months after birth. By around six months, efficacy was around 69%. Infants 6 months and younger are especially vulnerable to severe cases of RSV. The shot also lowered the risk of developing respiratory disease from RSV that required doctors’ visits by 51% within about six months. After that, however, the vaccine didn’t appear to make a big difference. In a briefing document, the FDA said safety data from the trial seemed “generally favorable.” The most common side effects of the shot reported among pregnant women were fatigue, headache, muscle pain and injection site pain. However, the agency noted that there was a slightly higher rate of preterm births — defined as before 37 weeks’ gestation — among people who received the vaccine (5.7%) versus those who got a placebo (4.7%). The difference wasn’t statistically significant, however, so it’s unclear whether it was vaccine-related. Both rates were lower than the rate of preterm births in the general population: around 10%, according to the CDC. Last year, the pharmaceutical giant GSK halted its trial of an RSV vaccine for infants after it showed a higher preterm birth rate among some vaccine recipients. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the outcome of GSK’s trial was relevant to Pfizer’s study, since the two vaccines are similar. “I worry that if preterm births are in any way a consequence of this vaccine, that would be tragic in many ways,” Offit said at Thursday’s meeting. He voted against the shot based on its safety. Pfizer said that if its shot is approved, it would continue to monitor the risk of preterm birth among vaccine recipients. Levy said researchers generally pay close attention to any potential risk of preterm birth among vaccines given to pregnant people. “There’s always the background concern: Are you inducing some inflammation that could be a problem? Because the body reads inflammation as ‘the woman’s no longer safe, let’s get the baby out.’ So you want a fairly bland vaccine,” he said. But Adam Berger, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health who voted in favor of the shot based on both safety and efficacy, said the vaccine is strongly needed. “There isn’t another option here for prevention and it really could save a lot of lives,” Berger said. Eleven RSV vaccines (including GSK’s approved shot) are being actively studied in U.S. trials, according to data provided to NBC News by PATH, a nonprofit global health organization. Six are for older adults, and five are designed to protect infants or children. A monoclonal antibody injection, which is given directly to infants and functions similarly to a vaccine, has already been approved in Canada, Europe and the United Kingdom. The FDA began reviewing data on that shot in January and is expected to decide this summer or fall whether to approve it. "
FDA approves drug to treat hot flashes and night sweats,Linda Carroll,"May 12, 2023, 10:41 PM UTC / Updated May 17, 2023, 2:55 PM UTC",Women's Health,"The Food and Drug Administration approved on Friday a new nonhormonal medication to treat the hot flashes and night sweats that often plague people during menopause. While not quite as effective as the standard treatment — estrogen or estrogen coupled with progestin — the new prescription drug, fezolinetant, will be welcomed by those who struggle with vasomotor symptoms — episodes of intense heat along with sweating and flushing — and won't or can’t take hormonal therapy, such as breast cancer survivors. The pills will be marketed as Veozah to treat moderate to severe hot flashes, the most common symptom caused by menopause which can last for several years or as long as a decade or more. “I’m so excited about this FDA ruling,” said Dr. Mary Rosser, an assistant professor of women’s health at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and director of Integrated Women’s Health at Columbia. “We’re talking about something that is going to be powerful."" Rosser said the drug will be a ""game-changer"" for women who don't want to take hormone replacement therapy or who have been treated for hormone-sensitive cancers. That includes patients like Diane Hoard, whose hot flashes came on strong shortly after she hit menopause. Hoard remembers a particular blustery and snowy winter day when the temperature was hovering around 32 degrees. “I had my coat wide open,” she told NBC News. “I had sweat running down my forehead. I was miserable.” A prescription for hormone therapy quieted the hot flashes. But a year after she started taking the medication, Hoard was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer and told she couldn’t take hormones anymore. Hoard’s hot flashes came back with a vengeance, hitting her every 30 minutes, ruining her concentration and sleep. “It’s just affecting my life tremendously,” she said. Hoard is looking forward to getting a prescription for the new drug. “I’m looking to just have some normalcy back in my life because it’s been debilitating for me,” she said. With the FDA approval, the pills could be available in pharmacies within weeks, Marci English, vice president and head of BioPharma Development at Astellas, the drug’s maker, said in an interview. The medication isn’t a panacea, however. Hormone replacement therapy cools hot flashes in more than 90% of those who take it. The percentages are smaller with the new medication. A Phase 3 trial showed that it improved hot flashes in slightly less than half of those who took it: 48% of women on a higher dose and 36% of those on a lower dose reported being much, or moderately, better, versus 33% in the placebo group. “I don’t see it as a replacement for estrogen,” said Dr. Samantha Dunham, a clinical associate professor and co-director of the Center for Midlife Health and Menopause at NYU Langone, who has been an adviser for the drug company. “I see it as a nonhormonal alternative for people who aren’t able to or don’t want to take hormone therapy.” The medication works by targeting and blocking a receptor in the brain which regulates body temperature, according to the FDA statement. According to Astellas, a 30-day supply is expected to cost $550. “Unfortunately, the thing that’s going to be the biggest issue I’m sure in my practice and everybody else’s practice is just what the pricing of the drug is,"" Dr. Holly Thacker, director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Specialized Women’s Health, said.  ""It’s very frustrating to have an exciting drug that works, yet most of your patients can’t get access to it or can’t afford it."" The new medication doesn't help other menopause symptoms such as thinning bones or vaginal dryness and painful sex, Dunham said. Relief for hot flashes goes beyond comfort. ""Flashing is really not good for the brain or the cardiovascular system,"" said Thacker. ""So, you know, you just can’t blow those symptoms off in many women.” The clinical data showed relatively few side effects, at least in the time period covered by the trials. Some participants did have abnormal values in tests of liver function, but those markers went back to normal after the medication was discontinued. CORRECTION (May 12, 2023, 11:56 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the name of the medication. It is fezolinetant, not frezolinetant.   "
Chronic pain is more common than diabetes or depression. Better treatments are emerging.,Aria Bendix,"May 16, 2023, 5:38 PM UTC",Health news,"People are developing new cases of chronic pain at higher rates than new diagnoses of diabetes, depression or high blood pressure, according to a study published Tuesday. The research, which appears in the journal JAMA Network Open, relied on data from an annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which asked adults how often they experienced pain in the prior three months. Chronic pain was defined as pain on most days or every day during that window. The researchers compared the responses of more than 10,000 people in 2019 and 2020. To determine the rate of new cases that developed over that period, they used a metric called person-years, which accounts for the number of people in the study and the amount of time between people's survey responses, since not everyone responded at the same intervals. The researchers identified around 52 new cases of chronic pain per 1,000 person-years. That was higher than the rate for high blood pressure — 45 new cases per 1,000 person-years — and far higher than the rates of new depression and diabetes cases. Of those without any pain in 2019, 6.3% reported new chronic pain in 2020, according to the study. ""What we’re finding is, to nobody’s surprise, we have an astounding problem of pre-existing chronic pain in this country and a huge amount of people who are developing chronic pain as each year goes by,"" said Dr. Sean Mackey, chief of pain medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine, who wasn't involved in the research. In 2019, around 21% of the more than 10,000 adults who participated in the NIH study reported chronic pain. By contrast, nearly 19% of U.S. adults had depression, while rates of diabetes, heart disease and asthma were below 10%, according to the CDC. High blood pressure was more common than chronic pain: Around 48% of adults had hypertension, on average, from 2017 to 2020. ""Chronic pain can be a disease in and of its own right,"" Mackey said. He added that people often experience chronic pain across multiple parts of the body, but low-back pain is the most common, followed by headache and neck pain. The new study found that people ages 50 and up had a higher risk of chronic pain than younger adults. However, not all cases persist: Around 10% of adults who reported chronic pain in 2019 said they were pain-free in 2020. To treat chronic pain, many doctors start by prescribing mild painkillers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, then move to stronger drugs like opioids, according to Gregory Scherrer, whose lab at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine studies the underlying mechanisms behind pain. But Scherrer, who wasn’t part of the NIH research, said that “it’s not clear that opioids are always useful,” especially given that they are addictive and come with side effects such as drowsiness and sedation. Mackey estimated that in total, a couple hundred medications are available for people with chronic pain. But almost all are prescribed off-label, he said, which means they may not have been studied as treatments for chronic pain in large trials and aren't always covered by insurance. Doctors sometimes repurpose antidepressants, anti-seizure medications or drugs for abnormal heart rhythms for chronic pain patients, he said. ""One of the biggest problems we have in society is accessibility and affordability of access to these treatments,"" Mackey added. In a study last year, around 20% of people with chronic severe back pain said they weren't receiving treatment for it (though the study did not account for the use of over-the-counter medications). Other options for managing chronic pain include physical therapy, psychotherapy and nerve blocks — injecting an anesthetic or anti-inflammatory drug at the site of the pain. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, Mackey said, and research is underway to give patients better options. Scherrer's lab, for instance, is researching ways to develop new nonaddictive painkillers. In particular, he's hoping to identify nerve cells that are responsible for the physical sensation of pain. ""The goal would be to be able to shut off those cells or decrease their activity,"" he said. Scherrer and Mackey both said methods that stimulate nerve cells with electrodes or magnets have also shown promise. One such technique, called peripheral nerve stimulation, involves a procedure that implants electrodes along nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. The electrodes send pulses to the nerves that trick the brain into turning off or weakening pain signals. Another approach, transcranial magnetic stimulation, involves holding an electromagnetic coil against the scalp, which sends  pulses to the brain that similarly mask pain signals. Richard Nahin, an epidemiologist at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health who led the NIH study, said physicians have also gotten more interested in integrative therapies for chronic pain like acupuncture, massage therapy and yoga. ""Certainly in our clinical trials, which are published in major journals, we are finding benefits to these nonpharmacological approaches,"" he said. Scherrer emphasized the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy as well, which focuses on changing thoughts, beliefs and attitudes to assist with pain management. ""Sometimes the brain can fix itself,"" Scherrer said. ""If you promote a positive attitude and try to encourage the patient to believe that the treatment is going to work, it’s more likely to be successful."" A trial of 850 participants found that cognitive behavioral therapy led to a modest pain reduction but did not reduce the use of opioid medication. The ideal pain management strategy likely involves a combination of different treatments and interventions, experts said. In general, Mackey added, it's better to get treated early, before a person's pain starts to diminish their quality of life. ""If it is intruding on your ability to work, to play, to engage with family and friends, then by all means don’t suffer in silence. Seek out a good clinician,"" he said.

Study reveals staggering toll of being Black in America: 1.6 million excess deaths over 22 years,Liz Szabo | KFF Health News,"May 16, 2023, 3:09 PM UTC",Health news,"Research has long shown that Black people live sicker lives and die younger than white people. Now a new study, published Tuesday in JAMA, casts the nation’s racial inequities in stark relief, finding that the higher mortality rate among Black Americans resulted in 1.63 million excess deaths relative to white Americans over more than two decades. Because so many Black people die young — with many years of life ahead of them — their higher mortality rate from 1999 to 2020 resulted in a cumulative loss of more than 80 million years of life compared with the white population, the study showed. Although the nation made progress in closing the gap between white and Black mortality rates from 1999 to 2011, that advance stalled from 2011 to 2019. In 2020, the enormous number of deaths from Covid-19 — which hit Black Americans particularly hard — erased two decades of progress. Authors of the study describe it as a call to action to improve the health of Black Americans, whose early deaths are fueled by higher rates of heart disease, cancer, and infant mortality. “The study is hugely important for about 1.63 million reasons,” said Herman Taylor, an author of the study and director of the cardiovascular research institute at the Morehouse School of Medicine. “Real lives are being lost. Real families are missing parents and grandparents,” Taylor said. “Babies and their mothers are dying. We have been screaming this message for decades.” High mortality rates among Black people have less to do with genetics than with the country’s long history of discrimination, which has undermined educational, housing, and job opportunities for generations of Black people, said Clyde Yancy, an author of the study and chief of cardiology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. Black neighborhoods that were redlined in the 1930s — designated too “high risk” for mortgages and other investments — remain poorer and sicker today, Yancy said. Formerly redlined ZIP codes also had higher rates of Covid infection and death. “It’s very clear that we have an uneven distribution of health,” Yancy said. “We’re talking about the freedom to be healthy.” A companion study estimates that racial and ethnic inequities cost the U.S. at least $421 billion in 2018, based on medical expenses, lost productivity, and premature death. In 2021, non-Hispanic white Americans had a life expectancy at birth of 76 years, while non-Hispanic Black Americans could expect to live only to 71. Much of that disparity is explained by the fact that non-Hispanic Black newborns are 2½ times as likely to die before their first birthdays as non-Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic Black mothers are more than 3 times as likely as non-Hispanic white mothers to die from a pregnancy-related complication. (Hispanic people can be of any race or combination of races.) Racial disparities in health are so entrenched that even education and wealth don’t fully erase them, said Tonia Branche, a neonatal-perinatal medicine fellow at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago who was not involved in the JAMA study. Black women with a college degree are more likely to die from pregnancy complications than white women without a high school diploma. Although researchers can’t fully explain this disparity, Branche said it’s possible that stress, including from systemic racism, takes a greater toll on the health of Black mothers than previously recognized. Death creates ripples of grief throughout communities. Research has found that every death leaves an average of nine people in mourning. Black people shoulder a great burden of grief, which can undermine their mental and physical health, said Khaliah Johnson, chief of pediatric palliative care at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. Given the high mortality rates throughout the life span, Black people are more likely than white people to be grieving the death of a close family member at any point in their lives. “We as Black people all have some legacy of unjust, unwarranted loss and death that compounds with each new loss,” said Johnson, who was not involved with the new study. “It affects not only how we move through the world, but how we live in relationship with others and how we endure future losses.” Johnson’s parents lost two sons — one who died a few days after birth and another who died as a toddler. In an essay published last year, Johnson recalled, “My parents asked themselves on numerous occasions, ‘Would the outcomes for our sons have been different, might they have received different care and lived, had they not been Black?’” Johnson said she hopes the new study gives people greater understanding of all that’s lost when Black people die prematurely. “When we lose these lives young, when we lose that potential, that has an impact on all of society,” she said. And in the Black community, “our pain is real and deep and profound, and it deserves attention and validation,” Johnson said. “It often feels like people just pass it over, telling you to stop complaining. But the expectation can’t be that we just endure these things and bounce back.” Teleah Scott-Moore said she struggles with the death of her 16-year-old son, Timothy, an athlete who hoped to attend Boston College and study sports medicine. He died of sudden cardiac arrest in 2011, a rare condition that kills about 100 young athletes a year. Research shows that an underlying heart condition that can lead to sudden cardiac death, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, often goes unrecognized in Black patients. Scott-Moore still wonders if she should have recognized warning signs. She also has blamed herself for failing to protect her two younger sons, who found Timothy’s body after he collapsed. At times, Scott-Moore said, she wanted to give up. Instead, she said, the family created a foundation to promote education and health screenings to prevent such deaths. She hears from families all over the world, and supporting them has helped heal her pain. “My grief comes back in waves, it comes back when I least expect it,” said Scott-Moore, of Baltimore County, Maryland. “Life goes on, but it’s a pain that never goes away.” KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

"In South Florida, ‘black snow’ makes breathing difficult for some Black and Latino residents",Patrice Gaines,"May 10, 2023, 7:57 PM UTC / Updated May 16, 2023, 3:09 PM UTC",NBCBLK,"The ash winds up everywhere — it’s in the laundry, on cars and blankets vegetation in backyard gardens. Black snow, as the ash is known, flutters down, covering homes in parts of South Florida intermittently from October through May each year, as planned burns are carried out in thousands of acres of sugar cane fields to help the crops. People who live around the south shore of Lake Okeechobee, an area that includes predominantly Black and Latino communities and many living in poverty, have complained for decades about the ash. While nearby sugar companies and farmers insist burnings are tightly regulated by the state, some residents say they stay in their homes with their windows shut in an effort to thwart respiratory illnesses. Ahead of the current preharvest burn season, Florida State University researchers published a study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, stating that between one and six people die because of health complications brought on by the crop burns each year. The researchers also cite previous work showing that the particulates associated with the burns are known to cause asthma, lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses. Members of Florida’s Stop the Burn movement say they hope the study, as well as joining forces with a similar campaign in Louisiana, will bring national attention to their longtime battle and push sugar companies and farmers to consider alternatives to burning. According to the Sierra Club, an environmental group that has organized the Stop the Burn campaign, Black and Latino residents in western Palm Beach County, who are “surrounded by over 75 percent of the total sugarcane acreage in Florida” are more likely to interact with the fallout of the burns. Kina Phillips, who joined the Stop the Burn campaign seven years ago, had been working as a patient outreach coordinator for a doctor when, she said, she noticed the impact the sugar cane burning was having on the community’s health. “We had to put more people on breathing machines and write scripts for asthma medication during the burning,” she said. “We had to call ambulances when they could hardly breathe.” A review of eight years of hospital data in 2021 by the investigative organization ProPublica and the Palm Beach Post newspaper, showed a spike in hospital and emergency room visits for residents of Belle Glade, the largest city in the burn area, during the burning season. R.D. Williams, CEO of the Hendry Regional Medical Center in Clewiston, Florida, said his center’s records show little fluctuation for respiratory complaints month to month, except some “variability during flu season, which seems to line up well with harvest season.” Farmers burn sugar cane to destroy unneeded leaves so it can be harvested more easily and efficiently. Sugar companies point out that the Florida Forest Service issues permits to farmers for burns and that burnings are carefully monitored by government regulations. The Florida Forest Service did not respond to questions. Sugar farming is big business in South Florida, employing more than 14,000 people, generating about $800 million in revenues annually, according to Palm Beach County. Environmental activists say the power of “Big Sugar” makes some people hesitate to criticize the burnings. “Some people say the sugar companies do a lot of good,” said Luz Torres, a member of the Stop the Burn Campaign who lives in Pahokee. “They are afraid the sugar company will close and they will lose their jobs. Some people tell me, ‘Luz, what’s the difference between what’s burning in the air and people smoking?’ I say, ‘I don’t choose to have ash falling on me and to breathe in smoke.’” The two largest sugar companies in the state, U.S. Sugar. and Florida Crystals have repeatedly stated that they abide by state air quality measures. U.S. Sugar did not provide comment before publication. In response to a 2021 investigation into sugarcane burning in this region by ProPublica and the Palm Beach Post, the company said the reporters were “selectively presenting their preferred interpretation of studies to support a biased conclusion for this story.” In a statement, Florida Crystals said the company “is committed to safe farming practices.” The prescribed burns, the company said, “are regulated and permitted on a daily, field-by-field basis by Florida Forest Service as part of the State of Florida’s nationally recognized regulatory program. Air-quality monitoring conducted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and by private air monitors consistently shows that our Glades farming region has some of the best air quality in the State of Florida — better than the state average, year after year.” But there has long been disagreement over how air quality is measured. Katherine Pruitt, national senior director of policy at the American Lung Association, said the organization does not “support agricultural burning; we believe it has negative health and air impact. But for a community fighting an industry like this, they need more data. It’s a challenge when it’s your story versus mine.” The American Lung Association recently published its “State of the Air” report and gave Palm Beach County an “A” for air quality. “We don’t collect air quality data ourselves,” Pruitt said. “We use EPA collected data. We rely on EPA state monitors. In Palm Beach, there are three monitors for the whole county.” In neighboring Hendry County, there are no monitors, she added. And while EPA monitors do pick up short-term spikes, such as those caused by agriculture burning, these increases tend to get lost when data is averaged over longer periods of time. “We are not seeing an intensity of exposure in those communities because we cannot capture it if there is not a monitor there,” Pruitt said. While the region passed the State of Air report, she said, “the annual particle pollution for Palm Beach County doesn’t look too great. It doesn’t violate clean air standards, but pollution is on the rise. We know burning things produces these deadly particles, but it can also come from tail pipes.” In 2015, the Sierra Club officially began its Stop the Burn Campaign, answering the call of residents in the burn region. Patrick Ferguson, Sierra Club senior organizing representative for Florida, has since visited Brazil, which stopped burning sugar cane fields and instead uses equipment that allows farmers to cut the cane. He said they hope to convince Florida’s sugar companies to do the same. David Mitchell, CEO of CROPS Carbon International., was interviewed for this article from Ireland, where he is working with farmers to reduce their environmental impact. “There is an opportunity for farmers to be heroes again,” he said. One method he points to is storing refuse from sugar cane deep in the ocean to aid marine ecology. Mitchell says the cost of transporting the trash to the deep sea is nominal compared to the current path of burning or other alternatives that require expensive equipment. Following publication of this article, a spokesperson for U.S. Sugar told NBC News that the company would not “be advocating for dumping anything in our oceans.” On the sidelines watching anxiously are independent farmers who have contracts with sugar companies and who say their methods are highly regulated and do not cause harm. Ardis Hammock has lived on her 105-year-old farm for 47 years. “I don’t remember a time when there hasn’t been an activist group that hasn’t been attacking us for some reason,” she said. She owns the farm on the southwest shore of Lake Okeechobee with her husband. “I have sugar cane fields 30 feet outside my house and I don’t have any health issues associated with the burn,” Hammock said. “I raised my two children in this house, and they never had health issues from the burn. As a mom, I would never put my children in harm’s way I thought was caused by my lifestyle.” Phillips, with the Stop the Burn campaign, said she is also concerned about what she might pass on to the children in her family. “My daughter had a son born during the time of burning,” she said. “He was a very healthy baby except we noticed when we took him out, he struggled to breathe.” Though her grandson has become better, the family monitors his breathing because he deals with congestion during the burn season. “I grew up here and there were things we were so used to and adapted to — they were not good,” Phillips said. “But it was normal for all my friends to have asthma, normal for people to have breakouts on their skin and when they went somewhere else, it cleared up. Everybody’s parents got disability checks because they had bad asthma. When we went on school field trips, they had inhalers for us. We didn’t put thought into what was causing it.” She said she is standing up for her ancestors who couldn’t because they were afraid they would lose their sugar company jobs or because they did not have information from health studies. “We can’t leave this on the shoulders of our kids. They will have another injustice they will have to fight.” CORRECTION (May 11, 2023, 12:05 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the number of EPA monitors in Palm Beach County.

Universal flu vaccine based on mRNA tech to be tested by National Institutes of Health,"Spencer Kimball, CNBC","May 15, 2023, 10:29 PM UTC",Cold and Flu,"Patients are now enrolling in an early-stage clinical trial to test a universal flu vaccine based on messenger RNA technology, the National Institutes of Health announced Monday. Scientists hope the vaccine will protect against a wide variety of flu strains and provide long-term immunity so people do not have to receive a shot every year. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is the technology behind Moderna’s and Pfizer’s widely used Covid vaccines. NIH played a crucial role in developing the mRNA platform used by Moderna. “A universal flu vaccine could serve as an important line of defense against the spread of a future flu pandemic,” Dr. Hugh Auchincloss, acting director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement Monday. The universal flu vaccine trial will enroll up to 50 healthy people ages 18 through 49 to test whether the experimental shot is safe and produces an immune response, according to NIH. The study will also include participants who receive a quadrivalent flu vaccine, which protects against four strains of the virus, to compare the experimental universal shot to those currently on the market. The universal shot was developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The clinical trial is enrolling volunteers at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. The current generation of flu vaccines provide important protection against hospitalization but the effectiveness of the shots can vary widely from year to year. Scientists right now have to predict months in advance which flu strains will dominate so vaccine manufacturers have time to produce the shots ahead of the respiratory virus season. The dominant flu strains can change between the time when experts select the strains and the manufacturers roll the shots out. In some seasons, the shots are not matched well to the circulating strains and are less effective as a consequence. Flu vaccines reduce the risk of illness by 40% to 60% when they are well matched against the circulating strains, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But in some years the the vaccines’ effectiveness has been as low as 19% because the shot was not well matched. Flu killed between 12,000 and 52,000 people annually in the U.S. from 2010 to 2020 depending the circulating strains and how well matched the shots were, according to the CDC. "
CDC alerts doctors about mpox outbreak in Chicago and possible summer rise in cases,Benjamin Ryan,"May 8, 2023, 11:02 PM UTC / Updated May 15, 2023, 9:35 PM UTC",Men's Health,"A recent uptick in mpox diagnoses in Chicago, many of them in people vaccinated against the virus and at least one in a previously infected person, has raised concerns about a possible increase in cases among gay and bisexual men during the summer. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert about the new diagnoses and the Chicago Public Health Department reported that the city has seen 20 new cases of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, since mid-April. Howard Brown Health, an LGBTQ-focused clinic in Chicago, diagnosed 11 of the cases. By comparison, only one mpox case, also diagnosed at Howard Brown, was reported to the city health department during the previous three months. Public health experts expressed measured concern that, similar to other cases of infections that are transmitted through sexual contact, mpox cases could rise during the summer, especially as gay and bi men travel to Pride festivals and other major LGBTQ events. “Without renewed vaccination and prevention efforts, we are at risk for a resurgence of mpox,” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy coordinator of the White House national mpox response. “Vaccine is a really important tool, even if it’s not perfect.” Diagnosed cases have been “increasing slightly” in eight countries in recent weeks, including France and several countries in east Asia, said Dr. Rosamund Lewis, the technical lead for mpox at the World Health Organization. About half of the recent French cases were in vaccinated people. Otherwise, global case counts have continued to decline since the early-August peak. Accordingly, on May 11, the World Health Organization declared an end to mpox as a global health emergency. Since mid-April, Lewis said, only 21 of the 111 nations to report cases during the outbreak have reported any new diagnoses. However, many cases may go undetected, she said. Chicago’s weekly mpox case rate is the highest since early November. According to CDC data, which is updated biweekly, the U.S. has had a rolling seven-day average of no more than 17 diagnoses since mid-February. The Howard Brown clinic is analyzing the new cases to determine whether any are part of a linked cluster of infections. Of the first 14 cases out of 20 recently reported in Chicago, 80 percent were in men who have sex with men and the rest had an unknown sexual orientation, according to a spokesperson from the city health department. Information on the six new cases reported Monday is forthcoming. Ten of the individuals were fully vaccinated with two doses of the Jynneos vaccine, including four who received both doses subcutaneously and four who received one dose via that injection technique and the other intradermally. A Howard Brown representative reports that one was previously infected with mpox, in August. None of the 14 cases involved hospitalization, but two individuals were treated with the antiviral TPOXX. Of the 11 cases diagnosed at Howard Brown, all were mild, with none requiring treatment for pain. Even with a breakthrough infection, the vaccine is still likely to reduce the severity of an infection, Dr. Leanna Gordon, the medical director of preventive medicine at Howard Brown, said. The CDC reported Monday that travel history was available on nine of the Chicago cases and four had recently traveled to New York City, New Orleans and Mexico. Gordon emphasized the importance that people at substantial risk of mpox get both doses of the Jynneos vaccine to protect themselves and their sexual partners. “One of our major concerns is that our population at risk are under-vaccinated,” Gordon said. “We haven’t had as much interest in the vaccine as we would like.” According to the CDC, more than 1.2 million doses of the Jynneos vaccine have been administered across the country to 725,000 people, 90% of them male. The agency estimates that only 1 in 4 of those most at risk, including gay and bi men and transgender people, have been fully vaccinated. Two doses of the Jynneos vaccine reduced the risk of mpox disease by 69%, and one dose was 37% effective, the CDC reported in December. Updated figures are expected next week. Public health experts expressed concern that mpox could spread more widely across the country after Chicago hosts the International Mr. Leather festival, a popular destination for gay men, at the end of the month. Daskalakis said the CDC is working with Howard Brown and other local partners to leverage the event to promote mpox prevention and awareness. Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious disease physician at the University of Southern California, said, “We need to maintain vigilance and promote and provide free vaccination.” Mpox, which has an incubation period of about three to 17 days, typically manifests as a rash and lesions. Other potential symptoms include: In France, national health authorities recently reported that of the 19 diagnoses this year through April 3 in the Centre-Val de Loire region, 16 were made after March 1 and all but one were in men who have sex with men. Ten of the cases were in people who were fully vaccinated: six who had two doses of the Jynneos vaccine and four who had received the smallpox vaccine in childhood and a recent Jynneos dose. Last summer's mpox outbreak declined following a combination of vaccination, immunity after infection and behavior change among gay and bi men. Infectious disease experts believe existing immunity from previous infection and vaccination would be likely to prevent mpox from spreading at the same level as last year. But questions remain about the duration of immunity and whether gay men, many of whom reported reducing their number of sexual partners or even practicing abstinence last summer, have returned to their baseline behavior patterns after mpox cases dramatically waned. “Everybody’s efforts have contributed to controlling the outbreak, but it’s not gone,” Lewis said. She noted that there is evidence that mpox can spread both before symptoms begin and from people who never develop symptoms. Dr. Marc C. Shamier, a resident in clinical microbiology at University Medical Center Rotterdam in the Netherlands, reported that in September, about 45% of gay and bi men visiting sexual health centers in Rotterdam and Amsterdam had detectable antibodies against orthopoxviruses, the family to which mpox belongs. “However,” Shamier said in an email, “this level of immunity is not sufficient to fully stop viral circulation, so sporadic clusters of monkeypox are to be expected.” Shamier continued: “Large-scale events such as annual Pride parties could increase the number of sexual contacts among the risk group, which may lead to a rise in viral circulation and infections."" With testing, isolation of cases and higher levels of mpox immunity among risk groups, Shamier expects the number of cases to be relatively low compared to last year. Daskalakis said the recent cases in Chicago amount to “a call to action as opposed to a call to panic.” “We have the tools to take care of this,” he said. “We just have to get it done.” "
Why Lyme disease symptoms go away quickly for some and last years for others,Caroline Hopkins,"May 14, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",Health news,"Why some people recover from Lyme disease, while others experience months, years or even decades of chronic symptoms has long puzzled doctors. New research offers some clues to an immune system marker in the blood that is elevated among people with lingering Lyme disease symptoms, even after they’d received antibiotics. In the new study, published on May 9 in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal, researchers found an immune system marker in the blood called interferon-alpha was elevated among people who had been treated for Lyme disease but had lingering symptoms. Interferon-alpha is one of a handful of key signaling proteins the body makes to tell immune cells to fight off bacteria or viruses. If the blood levels are too high, the immune system can overact, causing pain, swelling and fatigue — symptoms often seen with Lyme disease. In patients with high levels of interferon-alpha, the immune response to the Lyme bacteria may cause chronic inflammation, even once the infection is gone, said Klemen Strle, an assistant research professor of molecular biology and microbiology at Tufts University and an author of the new study. “We think this is a possible driver of persistent symptoms,” Strle said. And since a number of drugs are already approved to lower interferon-alpha, he suggested the research could mean a possible treatment option for lingering Lyme symptoms. The study was small, including 79 people diagnosed with Lyme disease, and found only a link between the higher interferon-alpha levels and the persistent Lyme disease symptoms, not that the immune marker was itself causing the lasting symptoms. A larger clinical trial would be needed to affirm the connection. Anywhere from 30,000 up to 500,000 people develop Lyme disease from a tick bite each year, according to the CDC. For most, the infection is mild and easily treated with antibiotics. About 10% experience symptoms like fatigue and brain fog along with muscle, joint and nerve pain that persists even after treatment. The new findings represent a significant shift in understanding why some people infected with Lyme suffer chronic symptoms. Previously, some researchers believed that a specific strain of the spiral-shaped Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria that causes Lyme might be a cause. Others wondered whether undetectable low levels of infection lingered in the body after treatment. The new research suggests that the way the body reacts to the bacteria — not the bug itself — could result in long-lasting symptoms. It’s still unclear why some people have elevated interferon-alpha, but Strle said he’s looking into a possible genetic cause. Although the interferon-alpha research is still in an early phase, Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the division of pediatric diseases at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., called it ""very well-designed and interesting.” “It provides a possible therapeutic target that could be studied in clinical trials to treat these patients,"" she said. For people coping with ongoing Lyme symptoms, any biological explanation for the condition called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS, is a step forward. Rebecca Greenberg isn’t entirely sure when she first contracted Lyme disease, but she has her suspicions. Greenberg, now 26, clearly remembers her mom tweezing a small, firm tick from the back of her neck after she’d been playing at a playground near Albany, New York, when she was 9 years old. She may have had multiple tick bites from her time spent in the Adirondack Mountains but didn’t worry about them until she started feeling sick at age 15. “I was so tired I would tell my mom I couldn’t wake up for school anymore,” said Greenberg, who grew up in upstate New York but now lives in South Florida. “My muscles would hurt, my joints would hurt and I’d get these migraines.” Doctors told Greenberg her symptoms were likely hormonal, and when Greenberg landed in the emergency room unable to move the left side of her body, they prescribed anti-anxiety medication and suggested she see a neurologist. Those doctors weren’t much help either, Greenberg said. Her symptoms eventually became so severe she stopped attending school and required a wheelchair. It wasn’t until 2011, after Greenberg’s mom posted to Facebook about her daughter’s mystery illness that a pediatrician friend suggested Lyme disease. Antibody tests soon showed Greenberg had been infected with Lyme and two other bacterial infections, babesiosis and bartonella. Even now, she’s still dealing with fatigue and nerve pain. The most debilitating symptoms of her Lyme disease have been the psychiatric effects, including severe anxiety, depression and hallucinations, she said. “I’m essentially still putting Band-Aids on all of my symptoms,” she said. “One tick turned my life upside down."" As the geographic spread of Lyme ticks intensifies, there’s an urgent need for more accurate tests that can pick up infection at its earliest stages, researchers and health officials acknowledge. “There is no doubt Lyme disease and other tick-borne infectious agents are increasing in prevalence,” Strle said. The Environmental Protection Agency warns that disease-carrying ticks are most active in warmer temperatures, and climate change will likely mean the insects will increasingly survive the winter and spread to regions beyond the Northeast, Northern California and northern areas of the Midwest. Testing for Lyme disease is complicated, especially for doctors who aren’t familiar with the process, DeBiasi said. “That leads to many people who have Lyme being missed or people who have symptoms being told they have Lyme when actually they don’t,” she said. “Combine that with bad information on the internet, and you end up with a lot of confusion.” Part of the problem is that once the bacterium is transmitted from a tick into a human, it rapidly spreads through the body at levels that may be too low for a test to pick up. “This quickly becomes a detection issue,” Brandon Jutras, associate professor in the biochemistry department at Virginia Tech, explained. Serology tests, which look for antibodies in the blood, are the best available method for diagnosing Lyme, experts say. However, antibody tests indicate the immune system has mounted an attack against a virus or bacteria, but can’t determine whether there is an active infection. They don’t work until the immune system generates a sufficient number of antibodies, which can take six weeks or more after an initial tick bite. The CDC recommends using a combination of antibody tests to diagnose Lyme, including an immunoassay antibody test like ELISA followed by an immunoblot antibody test like the Western blot test. Doctors and health officials recognize the need for more reliable Lyme disease tests that can pick up infection early on. “We need to do better,” said Jutras, who’s working with a team at Virginia Tech to develop a rapid Lyme test that could identify the actual infection from the earliest sign of a tick bite. “What we really want is a test that says, ‘Does a person still have Borelli spirochete [Lyme bacteria], and do we need to treat it with antibiotics?'” said Dr. Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University. Because testing is inadequate, there’s no way to link long-lasting symptoms to the initial Lyme infection. Many doctors avoid a diagnosis of chronic Lyme since the term implies a lingering infection. “There’s no way to say a Lyme diagnosis from, say, six years ago has anything to do with the symptoms occurring now,” DeBiasi said. “Symptoms like musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, difficulty thinking and depression are nonspecific. There are many, many possible reasons for those symptoms other than Lyme.” Columbia University's Fallon prefers the term “long Lyme.” ""‘Chronic’ is a reasonable term if it refers to having symptoms chronically,"" Fallon said. “The problem is when someone thinks they have an ongoing chronic infection and need more antibiotic treatments.” DeBiasis insists the symptoms people experience are real, even if  PTLDS experiences are the exception. As a pediatric doctor, she’s seen panicked parents seek unproven therapies after finding a tick on their child. In a recent study published in the journal Pediatric Research, DeBiasi and colleagues found 75% of children with Lyme disease were  better within six months of antibiotics, while 9% had symptoms affecting their functioning after six months. “If you give them a little more time, they seem to fully recover,” DeBiasi said. With the exception of Pfizer and Valneva, which are testing a Lyme disease vaccine in clinical trials, the drug development industry has not, for the most part, focused its energies or dollars on Lyme. Federal research grants are lacking too, Jutras said. “A lot of private foundations have stepped up to the plate as it relates to funding research for Lyme, but at the federal level, it may be time to revisit some of the priorities as it relates to where we’re spending research dollars.” "
Michael J. Fox opens up about variety of injuries due to Parkinson’s disease,"Anna Kaplan, TODAY","May 12, 2023, 5:09 PM UTC",Pop Culture News,"Michael J. Fox says he has broken several bones in the past few years, one of the indirect effects of his Parkinson’s disease. Fox pointed to each bone he’s broken in the past few years in an interview with Variety. “I broke this shoulder — had it replaced. I broke this elbow. I broke this hand. I had an infection that almost cost me this finger. I broke my face. I broke this humerus,” Fox said. “And that sucked.” Fox, 61, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease when he was 29, and he said he now has more medical support than he has before. “I have aides around me quite a bit of the time in case I fall, and that lack of privacy is hard to deal with,” he said. Fox said his health issues in recent years pulled him into a dark time, similar to when he was first diagnosed. He said it was the people closest to him that was able to help: “My family pulled me out.” Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended and uncontrollable movements, according to the National Institutes of Health. The symptoms begin gradually and can eventually affect the ability to walk and talk, according to the NIH. The four main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include tremors, muscle stiffness, slowness of movement and impaired balance, which can lead to falls, according to the NIH. Fox officially retired from acting in 2020 because he was struggling to remember his lines, Variety reported, but the “Back to the Future” actor was recognized in November with an honorary Oscar for his advocacy work with Parkinson’s disease. “I’ve won more awards and had more nominations since I announced my diagnosis,” Fox said. “It may be that people feel bad for me, but I prefer to look at it as an acknowledgment for continuing to have a legitimate career.” Fox also starred in a documentary about his rise to stardom in Hollywood and 1991 diagnosis, “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie,” which premiered Friday on Apple TV+. In the documentary, he opens up about his wife Tracy Pollan’s reaction to his diagnosis. “‘In sickness and in health,’ I remember her whispering,” he said. “No one outside of my family knew.” Fox and Pollan have been married since July 1988 and share four children together: Sam, 33, Aquinnah, 28, Schuyler, 28, and Esmé, 21. Fox said he remains optimistic about his future and that there are reasons to be grateful for his life. “I’m still happy to join the day and be a part of things,” he said. “I just enjoy the little math problems of existence. I love waking up and figuring that stuff out and at the same time being with my family. My problem is I fall down. I trip over things and fall down and break things. And that’s part of having this. But I hope that, and I feel that, I won’t break as many bones tomorrow.” Still, Fox balked at people who call him a hero: “It’s just a nice way of people letting me know they are moved by my acceptance of things and by the way that I’ve tried to make a difference.” “But no matter how much I sit here and talk to you about how I’ve philosophically accepted it and taken its weight, Parkinson’s is still kicking my ass. I won’t win at this. I will lose,” Fox added. “But, there’s plenty to be gained in the loss.” "
Football and baseball legend Bo Jackson says he’s had hiccups for nearly a year,"Drew Weisholtz, TODAY","May 12, 2023, 1:56 PM UTC",Health news,"Oncoming defenders on the football field and outfield walls on the baseball field couldn’t stop Bo Jackson, but the two-sport sensation has finally met his match: hiccups. The former Kansas City Royals and Los Angeles Raiders star, 60, says he has had the hiccups for nearly a year. The ailment caused him to miss a recent ceremony honoring fellow Auburn University star Frank Thomas, he said Wednesday on “McElroy and Cubelic in the Morning” on WJOX-FM in Birmingham, Alabama. “I’ve had the hiccups since last July and I’m getting a medical procedure done the end of this week, I think, to try to remedy it,” he said. “But I’m busy at the hospital sitting up with doctors poking me and shining lights down my throat, and probing me every way they can to find out why I’ve got these hiccups, so that’s the only reason that I wasn’t there.” Jackson was emphatic when asked if anyone has come up with a reason why he has the hiccups or if there’s any cure. “Hell, no,” he said. “I have done everything: scare me, drink water upside down, smell the a-- of a porcupine. It doesn’t work,” he said, as the hosts laughed. Hiccups can be classified in one of three ways, according to an article from the British Journal of General Practice posted on the National Institutes of Health’s website. “Depending on their duration, hiccups are classified as transient hiccups (episodes lasting seconds or minutes), persistent hiccups (longer than 48 hours), and recurrent hiccups (episodes of hiccups more lasting than transient and often with frequent repetition),” the the article states. To find out what causes hiccups, the article recommends “a thorough clinical history, asking about smoking and drug misuse, and drugs, gastrointestinal symptoms (heartburn, dysphagia, regurgitation, or abdominal pain), cardiorespiratory symptoms (chest pain, cough, or dyspnoea), and neurological symptoms (headache, diplopia, dizziness, or abnormal sensitivity).” The article also says patients should undergo a physical exam and, when necessary, a battery of tests, such as a blood test, chest X-ray, ECG, gastroscopy, abdominal CT and cranial MRI. Jackson is considered to be one of the greatest athletes in history, winning the Heisman Trophy in 1985 as the best player in college football. He would later star as a running back with the Los Angeles Raiders for four years, while also playing Major League Baseball as an outfielder with the Royals, Chicago White Sox and California Angels for eight seasons. His playing career in both sports was cut short after he suffered a hip injury during a playoff game with the Raiders in 1991. "
"At least 2 cases of drug-resistant ringworm infections found in the U.S., CDC says",Erika Edwards,"May 11, 2023, 5:04 PM UTC / Updated May 11, 2023, 6:56 PM UTC",Health news,"Two cases of highly contagious, drug-resistant ringworm infections have been detected in New York City — the first such cases reported in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. The infection was first identified in a 47-year-old woman who had developed a bad case of ringworm, also known as tinea, while traveling in Bangladesh. A rash had erupted across most of her body and typical antifungal creams did nothing to alleviate it. ""My radar went up immediately,"" said Dr. Avrom Caplan, an assistant professor of dermatology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who treated the patient and was one of the report's authors. The woman's infection turned out to be caused by a relatively new species of ringworm-causing fungus, called Trichophyton indotineae. Over the past decade, infections from this drug-resistant fungus have spread rapidly in South Asia, likely driven by overuse of medications to treat them, including topical antifungals and corticosteroids, the CDC report said. The woman's case spurred Caplan to ask his colleagues if they had seen similar infections. He soon discovered a second case in a 28-year-old New York woman. That woman had developed ringworm across much of her body during the summer of 2021. In this case, however, the patient had not traveled outside the U.S. Neither woman had underlying health conditions that might increase their risk for drug-resistant infections. Caplan alerted public health officials about the two cases in February. Outside Asia, cases have been identified in Europe and Canada. Trichophyton indotineae's emergence in the U.S. did not surprise Dr. Jill Weatherhead, an assistant professor of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""We've learned over the years, especially with the Covid pandemic, that something happening in another part of the world is likely to happen in our part of the world at some point,"" said Weatherhead, who was not involved with the new report. Like drug-resistant bacteria, drug-resistant fungi are a serious public health concern. Cases of Candida auris, another type of drug-resistant fungal infection, have been spreading in health care facilities in the U.S. That infection is extremely difficult to treat and can be deadly. ""We're always so focused on antimicrobial resistance as it relates to bacteria that we forget that those rules also apply to fungi,"" said Dr. Adam Friedman, professor and chair of dermatology at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. Friedman, who was not involved with the new report, said he has witnessed an uptick in patients with fungal infections whose conditions either take longer to respond to usual treatments or require additional medications. ""If you are treating something with a drug that you expect would work, but it doesn't get better, you need to go back to the drawing board,"" he said. Ringworm is not caused by a worm, as the name would suggest. It is a fungal infection. It spreads easily through skin-to-skin contact and usually looks like a circular pattern of raised, itchy scales. It can pop up on the face, chest, scalp or groin area. Ringworm can occur at any age but is more common in children. Typically, cases are treated with antifungal creams. But some particularly difficult cases require antifungal medications, such as terbinafine or itraconazole, taken in pill form. The two New York patients detailed in the CDC report were successfully treated with the oral drugs. But the medications, especially itraconazole, require a physician's care. The drug can cause heart failure and should not be taken with certain medications, according to the National Library of Medicine. Caplan said that he suspects there may be other U.S. cases of Trichophyton indotineae. The husband and son of the 47-year-old patient, for example, have also developed ringworm, and are undergoing testing to see if the fungi are the same. At this point however, he said, Trichophyton indotineae ""is not a widespread problem"" in the U.S. Caplan suggested people with suspected ringworm infections contact a dermatologist for evaluation. He also recommended washing linens, clothes and towels regularly to minimize the spread of the fungi. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
"Mpox is no longer a global health emergency, WHO announces",Aria Bendix,"May 11, 2023, 2:50 PM UTC / Updated May 11, 2023, 4:32 PM UTC",Health news,"The World Health Organization on Thursday declared an end to the global health emergency for mpox, the rare but potentially serious disease formerly known as monkeypox. Over the last three months, countries reported nearly 90% fewer cases compared to the previous three-month period, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Thursday. ""Yesterday, the emergency committee for mpox met and recommended to me that the multicountry outbreak of mpox no longer represents a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. I have accepted that advice. And I’m pleased to declare that mpox is no longer a global health emergency,"" Tedros said. The WHO issued the emergency declaration in July amid a major global uptick in cases. The designation is reserved for the most serious disease outbreaks and has been assigned to seven since 2007: mpox, Covid, Zika, H1N1 flu, polio and Ebola (which has gotten the declaration twice). More than 87,000 mpox cases and 140 deaths have been reported across 111 countries since January 2022, according to the WHO. The U.S. has recorded more than 30,000 cases and 42 deaths since May 2022, when the country’s outbreak began. Mpox belongs to the family of poxviruses, which includes smallpox. People with the disease often develop a rash, which may be on the hands, feet, chest, face or mouth, or near the genitals. Over the course of this outbreak, the virus has mostly spread through contact with lesions during sexual activity, and men represent the overwhelming majority of cases. The U.S. began widely distributing the Jynneos mpox vaccine to at-risk groups in June. The country's outbreak peaked in August, with more than 400 cases per day, but cases have dropped off since. Around 1.2 million vaccine doses have been administered during the outbreak, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that just 1 in 4 of the people most at risk are fully vaccinated. CDC data shows that a two-dose series of the Jynneos vaccine reduces the risk of mpox disease by 69%. The agency recommends the shots for men who have sex with men as well as transgender, nonbinary or gender-diverse people who have gotten a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease or have had more than one sexual partner in the past six months. The CDC issued a reminder this week about mpox vaccinations heading into the summer, as gay and bisexual men travel to LGBTQ events, which fueled outbreaks last year. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health recommended vaccines for people at higher risk for mpox ""to reduce the risk of contracting or transmitting mpox at upcoming festivals and Pride events."" The department cited a recent cluster of mpox cases in Chicago as evidence that infections could rise again. One Chicago-based clinic, Howard Brown Health, reported eight new cases of mpox between mid-April and Monday, compared with just one case in the prior three months. According to the CDC, more than half the cases in the Chicago cluster are among people who have gotten mpox vaccines. The agency is conducting studies to determine how long immunity after vaccination lasts. Tedros said Thursday that travel-related mpox cases in all regions of the world highlight the virus's continued threat. ""While we welcome the downward trend of mpox cases globally, the virus continues to affect communities in all regions, including in Africa, where transmission is still not well understood,"" he said.

More gay and bisexual men can donate blood under new FDA rules,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"May 11, 2023, 3:46 PM UTC",Health news,"The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that it finalized a new rule that will allow more gay and bisexual men to donate blood. Under the latest guidelines, all potential donors would need to complete individualized risk assessments — regardless of gender or sexual orientation. People who have had anal sex with new partners or more than one partner in the last three months would be asked to wait to donate blood. The updated guidelines mean most gay and bisexual men who are in monogamous relationships with other men will no longer need to abstain from sex to donate blood. Previously, the FDA allowed donations only from men who have sex with men if they hadn't had sex with other men for three months. “The implementation of these recommendations will represent a significant milestone for the agency and the LGBTQI+ community,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a release. The agency will continue to monitor the safety of the blood supply, he added. The FDA's restrictions on blood donations from men who have sex with men stem from the AIDS crisis, which began in the early 1980s, when little was known about HIV. The agency first proposed the new rules, which are in line with those in Canada and the United Kingdom, in January. People who are taking medication to prevent or treat HIV infections would be asked to wait to donate blood under the new guidelines. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
How doctors diagnosed a woman's eye infection linked to bacteria in eyedrops,Erika Edwards,"May 11, 2023, 2:20 PM UTC",Health news,"How a rare type of bacteria infected and ultimately blinded Nancy Montz's left eye was a head-scratcher for Dr. Morgan Morelli, a physician who specializes in infectious diseases. The Ohio woman had been infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium resistant to most antibiotics. Morelli, chief fellow in the division of infectious diseases and HIV medicine at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, had never seen this kind of bacteria in an eye. In fact, the particular kind of highly drug-resistant bacterium had never been reported in the United States. ""We were racking our heads trying to figure out how this happened,"" she said. Montz, 72, of Perry, did not wear contacts — a common route for bacteria to enter the eyes. Last November, in chilly northeastern Ohio, she certainly hadn't been swimming in any nearby lakes, another potential source of unusual bacteria. ""We thought that this was just some sort of freak accident,"" Morelli said. ""We had no idea that this case was going to be linked to a global manufacturing issue."" It took several months to confirm that Montz's infection had come from a contaminated bottle of EzriCare artificial tears, a product since linked to dozens of similar eye infections nationwide. Details of Montz's case were published Thursday in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. As of March 14, at least 68 people in 16 states had been diagnosed with such eye infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Eight patients, like Montz, lost vision in at least one eye. Four people had to have their eyeballs surgically removed. Three have died. EzriCare Artificial Tears, as well as Delsam Pharma's Artificial Eye Ointment, were recalled in February. The products had been manufactured by Global Pharma Healthcare in India and sold mostly online. The CDC expects more cases will be identified and plans to update its investigation into the cases in the coming weeks, a spokesperson said. The agency confirmed to NBC News that Montz is one of 68 patients so far in its ongoing investigation. Montz's infection was advanced when it was diagnosed, and she is unlikely to see out of that eye again. She first realized something was wrong when she woke up with an unusual smear of yellow discharge on her pillow. Her left eye was cloudy and she had trouble seeing out of it. The eye was ""real funky looking,"" Montz said. She couldn’t feel any pain or soreness, however, because a prior health problem had numbed the entire left side of her face, including her left eye. Her husband encouraged her to see a doctor, who prescribed antibiotics. But the drugs, which almost always take care of eye infections, didn't work. Within 48 hours, her eye became much worse. That's when Morelli got involved. Her team ultimately found the bacteria that had infected Montz's eye was also in the bottle of EzriCare artificial tears she'd ordered through Amazon. ""She probably scratched the left eye with the eyedropper accidentally and didn't realize it because she had no feeling,"" Morelli hypothesized. ""That allowed the infection to enter the eye much more easily and quickly in that eye before it ever affected the right one."" Morelli recommended several ways to reduce the risk of any type of eye infection: Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
"A simple, low-cost treatment process could save 22,000 new mothers' lives every year, scientists suggest",Julianne McShane,"May 10, 2023, 10:42 PM UTC",Women's Health,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa — A low-cost device, paired with a quick bundle of treatments to stop blood loss, could help prevent an estimated 22,000 maternal deaths per year, according to research released Tuesday. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, investigated ways to detect and reduce the prevalence of postpartum hemorrhages — the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide and the second-leading cause in the U.S., behind mental health conditions. The researchers looked at the use of a device called a calibrated plastic drape — essentially a plastic bag with labels to identify levels of blood loss up to 500 milliliters, which is considered the baseline for postpartum hemorrhage. They concluded that using the device nearly doubled the rate of accurate detection of postpartum hemorrhage compared to estimating blood loss visually, as many health care providers do. Providers who then delivered a bundle of treatments within 15 minutes based on the measurement — including a uterine massage, medications to induce contractions and stop bleeding, IV fluids and a physical exam — saw a 60% reduction in severe blood loss among patients relative to providers who administered the treatments one by one over a longer time. Postpartum hemorrhage is a serious but rare condition characterized by heavy bleeding that causes a severe drop in blood pressure. It affects 1% to 5% of women who give birth, and people with blood clotting disorders face increased risk. An estimated 14 million women per year experience postpartum hemorrhages worldwide, resulting in about 70,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. “Why is it that women are still dying? It’s because we aren’t picking up the cases and not treating them early enough,” said the new study’s lead author, Dr. Arri Coomarasamy, a professor at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. “If you control the bleeding early, then you win, and if you don’t, then you are really fighting a losing battle,” he added. That’s why the study’s proposed interventions “might be a game changer,” said Dr. Willibald Zeck, the chief of sexual and reproductive health and rights at the United Nations Population Fund, who was not involved in the trial. The study involved more than 210,000 women across 80 hospitals in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania. (About 70% of maternal deaths globally occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020, according to a WHO report.) Among the participants, 17 patients treated with the proposed set of interventions died, compared to 28 who received standard care. Traditionally, treatments for postpartum hemorrhage are delivered sequentially as providers assess what works, the new study noted. But Coomarasamy and his collaborators — who presented their findings at the International Maternal Newborn Health Conference in Cape Town — are pushing for the simultaneous delivery of various treatments to help save precious time. “It doesn’t matter which one works in the end if what you want to do is stop the bleeding,” Coomarasamy said. “The clock is ticking and the woman is bleeding — that’s where the problem is, and that’s where the bundle makes a real difference.” Widespread implementation of the proposed regimen would require governments — especially in low-income countries — to supply calibrated drapes and the components of the treatment bundle, including two kinds of drugs, along with trained personnel to administer them, the researchers said. Some such efforts are already underway. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which funded the study, will pay for a year’s supply of calibrated drapes in the 80 hospitals that were part of the trial, the researchers said. Allisyn Moran, the head of the WHO’s maternal health unit, who was also not involved in the trial, pointed out that the majority of providers in the study who delivered the proposed treatment regimen were midwives. “It’s an opportunity for us to also think about how we really strengthen midwifery care and midwives in all different settings,” Moran said. However, the study has some limits: It did not measure patients’ experiences of the care they received, nor did it include hospitals in high-income countries. But the researchers said they expect the results to be generalizable to other countries, noting the persistence of postpartum hemorrhage as a cause of maternal death in the U.S. A panel of independent experts is expected to review the study findings and determine whether the WHO should officially endorse the proposed interventions, a process that could take months.

A 'peanut patch' desensitized toddlers with peanut allergies in a promising late-stage trial,Aria Bendix,"May 10, 2023, 9:00 PM UTC",Kids' Health,"A wearable patch could prevent severe allergic reactions in toddlers with peanut allergies, according to the results of a promising clinical trial. The late-stage trial, which involved more than 200 children ages 1 to 3 with peanut allergies, found that after wearing the experimental patch around 22 hours a day for a year, 67% were able to tolerate 300 to 1,000 milligrams of peanut protein — the equivalent of one to four peanuts. The findings were published Wednesday evening in the New England Journal of Medicine. “Amazingly, not only did it raise the amount of peanut [tolerance] in these children, but the nature of the reaction also changed. There was a decrease in the number of severe reactions,” said Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, the study’s lead author and director of the Food Challenge and Research Unit at Children’s Hospital Colorado. The patch, a product called Viaskin from biopharmaceutical company DBV Technologies, contains a small dose of peanut protein equal to about 1/1,000th of a peanut kernel. A new patch is applied each day and worn between the shoulder blades so the skin absorbs the protein. Immune cells then carry the protein to other parts of the body, where they help suppress the allergic response, according to the company. There are no approved treatments for children under 4 with peanut allergies. The Food and Drug Administration has approved one for those ages 4 to 17, however: a powder called Palforzia that can be mixed with foods like applesauce, yogurt or pudding. The powder is similarly meant to lower the risk of severe allergic reactions by increasing kids' tolerance to peanuts over time. The Viaskin trial, however, is the first to study a non-oral option for this younger age group. Dr. Pharis Mohideen, DBV Technologies’ chief medical officer, said the goal of Viaskin isn’t to get kids to tolerate peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches or eliminate an allergy altogether. “We’re trying to build a protective layer for them so that if there is an accidental peanut exposure, they won’t have a reaction, or that reaction will be very mild and not send them to the emergency room,” he said. Getting kids with an allergy to a point where they can tolerate several peanut kernels, Mohideen added, is “absolutely life-changing” and would ease parents’ anxiety about taking their kids to restaurants or on airplanes. “If a label says ‘may contain peanuts,’ but you know you can tolerate a full peanut kernel, the likelihood that that product is safe is pretty high,” he said. About 1 in 50 children in the U.S. have a peanut allergy. A 2018 report determined that the prevalence of peanut allergies in the country tripled in the previous two decades, but the reasons for the trend aren’t fully clear. Up to 20% of people with a peanut allergy eventually outgrow it, though some people’s allergies worsen over time. In the Viaskin trial, four of the participating toddlers developed anaphylaxis — an allergic response often characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling in the throat, pale skin, blue lips, fainting or dizziness. The reactions weren't considered severe, though three required epinephrine, an injection more commonly known as an EpiPen. Greenhawt said most side effects in the trial were localized skin reactions. Other research into peanut allergy interventions is ongoing. Researchers at the UNC School of Medicine recently completed a Phase 2 trial in children ages 1 to 11 that involved putting a tiny amount of peanut protein under the tongue. Out of 47 kids who completed the treatment, 70% were able to tolerate the equivalent of around three peanuts, and 36% were able to tolerate the equivalent of around 16 peanuts. Viaskin is also being studied in children ages 4 to 7 and has previously been studied in adolescents and adults. But Greenhawt said the patch seems to be most effective in toddlers because younger kids’ immune systems are more malleable. Dr. Kanwaljit Brar, a pediatric allergy and immunology specialist at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone, said most of her patients with peanut allergies are babies and toddlers. Her older pediatric patients have seen improvements from Palforzia, she added, but it’s not suitable for everyone because it requires doctors’ visits every two weeks and isn’t covered by all insurance providers. The patch could eliminate some of those barriers to access, Brar said. ""I actually have a daughter with a peanut allergy, and this would be a great option for someone like me who’s a really busy parent,"" she said. Mohideen said DBV Technologies eventually plans to submit Viaskin to the FDA for approval, but added that the agency has asked the company to gather more safety data about the patch in both toddlers and children before it applies. There is no specific timeline for completing an application yet, he said. "
Your costs for Covid tests and treatments may rise after the public health emergency ends,Aria Bendix,"May 10, 2023, 6:44 PM UTC",Coronavirus,"Most people can expect to pay more for Covid tests after the federal public health emergency expires at the end of the day Thursday. The emergency declaration guaranteed widespread access to free Covid-related health services starting in January 2020. But once it ends, people with employer-based private health insurance could start paying for at-home Covid tests as well as rapid or lab tests at a doctor's office or clinic. Several large insurance companies — including UnitedHealthcare, Cigna and Aetna — have said their coverage of at-home tests, which cost about $11 on average, will end on Thursday. In California, however, residents will have continued access to free tests, vaccines and treatments given by licensed health care providers through Nov. 11. Additionally, the U.S. government is distributing free at-home tests from the national stockpile through the end of the month. The Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday that the government could decide to ship more tests in the future depending on supply. Federally purchased doses of Paxlovid — the go-to treatment for people at risk of severe disease — could also remain free as long as supply lasts, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank. Here are the expected changes to Covid-related costs. "
FDA advisory panels back making Opill birth control pill available over the counter,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"May 10, 2023, 5:39 PM UTC / Updated May 10, 2023, 6:32 PM UTC",Health news,"Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday voted unanimously to recommend making a birth control pill available without a prescription. The 17-0 vote by two advisory panels came despite serious reservations from agency officials about the quality of the data used to support switching the birth control pill, called Opill, from prescription to over the counter. The agency did not have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the drug. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendation of the committees, though the vote is expected to weigh heavily on its final decision, expected in late summer. If approved, Opill — from French drugmaker HRA Pharma — would be the first birth control pill available for over-the-counter sales in the United States. ""Opill has the potential to have a huge positive public health impact,"" Kathryn Curtis, a scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said following the vote. Making the medication available over the counter should increase access and reduce unintended pregnancies, she said. Advocacy groups have been pushing for years for an over-the-counter birth control pill. Many major medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, support over-the-counter use. The meeting took place over two days, and included two FDA advisory groups: the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Obstetrics, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee. On Tuesday, FDA officials pointed out several flaws in the company’s data, including a lack of information on whether women, including those with low literacy skills, would be able to understand the drug’s instruction label. Failure to take the birth control pill at the same time every day could lead to unintended pregnancy, they said. FDA panel members, however, said Wednesday that they believed most women could determine on their own whether the medication is appropriate to use. “We need to trust women,” Dr. Katalin Roth, a professor of medicine at the George Washington University of School of Medicine and Health Sciences, said after the vote. “I urge the FDA to approve.” HRA Pharma also noted that even when the birth control pill is prescribed, women can still miss doses, citing studies that about 15% of women may miss three or more doses at least once per month. Agency officials were concerned about side effects, such as vaginal bleeding, and whether users, particularly teenagers, would know to seek the help of a health care provider. Another concern was whether women with breast cancer or a history of breast cancer would know not to use the drug. FDA panel members said they didn’t expect that to be a problem because they said many women with breast cancer are aware they should not use hormonal contraceptives. Dr. Karen Murry, an FDA official who oversees nonprescription medications, acknowledged the importance of increasing access to effective contraceptives, noting that the agency has been put in a ""very difficult position"" because the company did not provide ""adequate"" data. The FDA approved Opill as a prescription drug in 1973. It contains  one hormone, progestin, and is taken daily. HRA Pharma is asking the FDA to approve the over-the-counter version for all users of reproductive age, including teenagers. Dr. Rachel Blake, a Boston-based obstetrician-gynecologist and fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said that if the medication is approved without an age restriction, teens and college-age women will likely gravitate to the over-the-counter version because it will be easier to get. “Sometimes younger patients either have barriers to getting to a doctor or just haven’t seen an OB-GYN yet,” said Blake, who isn't on either of the FDA advisory panels, “and so those patients will probably make use of the over-the-counter pills.” The medication will need to come at a “very, very low cost,” she added, because over-the-counter medications typically aren’t covered by insurance. HRA Pharma has not yet disclosed the price of the over-the-counter version. The move to switch from prescription to over the counter comes amid legal battles over women’s reproductive rights. Last summer, the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion. Another case, which could limit access to mifepristone, one of the drugs used in medication abortions, is working its way through the lower courts. Dr. Melissa Simon, a professor of clinical gynecology at Northwestern University, said the FDA advisory panels ""did the right thing"" by recommending Opill for over-the-counter sales despite the agency's skepticism. Simon, who isn't on either of the advisory panels, said progestin-only drugs, like Opill, carry a lower risk compared to ones that contain estrogen, which carry an increased risk of blood clots and stroke. She stressed that the pills need to be taken every day to be effective, recommending that women ""set a phone alarm or time it with something each day, like waking up in the morning or brushing your teeth."" During the FDA meeting, representatives of HRA Pharma said that making birth control over the counter could prevent more than 37,000 unintended pregnancies in one year. The company also noted that over-the-counter birth control pills are already available in several other countries. FDA officials noted, however, that other countries often do not treat nonprescription medications in the same way as the U.S. In other countries, in addition to prescription and over-the-counter use, there’s often a third category: pharmacist dispensed. While a person in another country may not have to get a physician’s prescription, they may have to speak to a pharmacist who may or may not dispense the medication.

Babies who have DNA from three different people born in the U.K. for first time,The Associated Press,"May 10, 2023, 5:19 PM UTC",Health news,"LONDON — Britain’s fertility regulator on Wednesday confirmed the births of the U.K.’s first babies created using an experimental technique combining DNA from three people, an effort to prevent the children from inheriting rare genetic diseases. The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority said fewer than five babies have been born this way in the U.K. but did not provide further details to protect the families’ identities. The news was first reported by the Guardian newspaper. In 2015, the U.K. became the first country to adopt legislation regulating methods to help prevent women with faulty mitochondria — the energy source in a cell — from passing defects on to their babies. The world’s first baby born using the technique was reported in the U.S. in 2016. The genetic defects can result in diseases such as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart problems and intellectual disabilities. About one in 200 children in Britain is born with a mitochondrial disorder. To date, 32 patients have been authorized to receive such treatment. For a woman with faulty mitochondria, scientists take genetic material from her egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that still has healthy mitochondria but had the rest of its key DNA removed. The fertilized embryo is then transferred into the womb of the mother. The genetic material from the donated egg comprises less than 1% of the child created from this technique. “Mitochondrial donation treatment offers families with severe inherited mitochondrial illness the possibility of a healthy child,” the U.K. fertility regulator said in a statement Wednesday. The agency said it was still “early days” but it hoped the scientists involved, at Newcastle University, would soon publish details of the treatment. Britain requires every woman undergoing the treatment to receive approval from the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority. The regulator says that to be eligible, families must have no other available options for avoiding passing on genetic disease. Many critics oppose the artificial reproduction techniques, arguing there are other ways for people to avoid passing on diseases to their children, such as egg donation or screening tests, and that the experimental methods have not yet been proven safe. Others warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could be a slippery slope that eventually leads to designer babies for parents who not only want to avoid inherited diseases but to have taller, stronger, smarter or better-looking children. Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell expert at the Francis Crick Institute, a biomedical research center in London, said it would be critical to monitor the babies’ future development. “It will be interesting to know how well the (mitochondrial donation) technique worked at a practical level, whether the babies are free of mitochondrial disease and whether there is any risk of them developing problems later in life,” he said in a statement. Scientists in Europe published research earlier this year that showed in some cases, the small number of abnormal mitochondria that are inevitably carried over from the mother’s egg to the donor’s can reproduce when the baby is in the uterus, which could ultimately lead to a genetic disease. Lovell-Badge said the reasons for such problems were not yet understood and that researchers would need to develop methods to reduce the risk. Previous research assessing another technique to create babies from three people, including an egg donor, found that years later the children were doing well as teenagers, with no signs of unusual health problems and good grades in school. Doctors in the U.S. were the first to announce the world’s first baby using the mitochondria donation technique, after the treatment was conducted in Mexico. "
"The smell of coconut may help keep mosquitoes away, small study finds",Kaitlin Sullivan,"May 10, 2023, 3:01 PM UTC",Health news,"What makes a person extra repulsive to a mosquito? It might be the scent of coconut. That was one of the more curious findings of a small study published Wednesday in the journal iScience, which looked at whether different scented soaps made people more or less attractive to mosquitoes. They found that the answer wasn’t as simple as use this soap, not that one. Instead, the interplay of scents between human bodies and the products they used proved to be much more complicated. “It’s a simple question with a very complex answer,” said the lead study author, Clement Vinauger, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Virginia Tech who studies the molecular genetics of how mosquitoes choose their prey. “What really matters is how the chemicals in the soap combine with the chemicals of the individual person.” That could explain why coconut seemed to repel mosquitoes, while citrusy scents known to repel the pesky insects instead appeared to attract them. Only female mosquitoes seek out blood, and only after they mate, when they need its nutrients for their eggs to develop. The rest of the time they feed on sweetly scented flowers. When we use perfumed products on our skin, “we are blurring the lines between humans and plants,” Vinauger said. “Mosquitoes have a single resource that smells like both.” A person’s scent comes from a unique combination of more than 350 chemicals, some of which are produced by the body and others that are produced by bacteria that live on and in us. Everyone has the same chemicals, just in different ratios, some more attractive to mosquitoes than others, said Ali Afify, an assistant professor of biology at Drexel University in Philadelphia, who wasn’t involved with the new study. There are a few known variables. Pregnancy or illness can change the chemical ratios and alter your attractiveness to mosquitoes. So can drinking beer or being physically active. Perfumes, soaps and lotions also play roles. “Everything you use on your skin can make you more or less attractive to mosquitoes,” Afify said. To see which chemicals could tip the scales in either direction, four volunteers were each asked to wash with four different brands of soap — Dial, Dove, Native and Simple Truth. In each instance, the volunteer washed one forearm and left the other untouched and then wore nylon sleeves on both arms for one hour. They repeated the process with the three other soaps. After the hour was up, the researchers removed the odor-soaked sleeves. They placed each sleeve in a cup and put the cups in a mesh cage full of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The species is found in the southern half of the U.S. and as far up the East Coast as Connecticut. The scent in the cup that attracted the most mosquitoes was deemed most attractive, and the results surprised the scientists. All four soaps contained limonene, a compound found in citrus that is a known mosquito repellent. But that didn’t seem to matter in three of the four soaps. They made people more attractive to mosquitos. The odor samples pulled from washed arms also had increased amounts of a chemical called terpene, a compound commonly found in essential oils and the one that gives cannabis its scent. The fact that the terpenes in soap seemed to make people more attractive to mosquitos didn’t seem to add up. “Terpenes tend to be repellent,” said Christopher Potter, an associate professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Maryland who studies mosquito olfaction. That the soaps weren’t repellent “suggests that what the mosquitos are picking up on is far more complicated,” said Potter, who wasn’t involved in the new research. It could be that certain scents amplify repellent or attractive compounds that naturally exist in humans, rather than eliciting those responses themselves, he said. In the end, the team identified four chemicals that were associated with being slightly more attractive to mosquitoes and three that appeared to repel them, but the results were generally weak and variable for all chemical scents tested except one: coconut. “It confirms what past studies have found, that mosquitoes don’t like coconut-scented products, so our safest bet right now is to use those,” Vinauger said. The new research was a proof-of-concept study, meaning the team set out to determine whether or not there was a phenomenon that warranted future research. It’s still unclear whether the coconut scent itself repels mosquitoes or whether it enhances one of the naturally occurring chemicals on human skin that is a repellent. It’s also unclear whether that is true for all of the roughly 200 species of mosquitoes that feed on humans or just the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes used in the study. Because odors are complex — a specific combination of about 12 chemicals is responsible for the strawberry scent — a single scent or compound isn’t likely to be solely responsible for how attractive a person is to mosquitoes. “Some may play a bigger role, but there won’t be just one that is the smoking gun that explains attraction,” Potter said.

Scientists announce rough draft of human pangenome,Evan Bush,"May 10, 2023, 3:00 PM UTC",Science News,"Researchers have constructed a rough draft of a human pangenome, a collection of DNA that represents the genetic information from 47 individuals. The development — a landmark in genomics — magnifies and expands scientists’ view of the code that makes us both uniquely human and different from one another. The new pangenome, which was described in articles published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature, could help scientists unlock small genetic differences that contribute to the development of conditions like heart disease or schizophrenia, among others, researchers said Tuesday at a news briefing. “We are finding remarkable patterns of genetic variation,” said Evan Eichler, a genome sciences professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine who was involved in the project. “There were hints of this before, but we didn’t actually have the right microscope to see this.” The pangenome dramatically expands upon the original human genome reference, which scientists have been using for about two decades. That original reference came largely from a single person, which limits its effectiveness. Because the DNA of 47 people is represented, the new pangenome better reflects the genetic information of people across the globe and from different backgrounds. Scientists say it represents much of the genetic diversity among humans, including the most common variations. “We now understand that having one map of a single human genome cannot adequately represent all of humanity,” said Karen Miga, an author of the research who is the associate director for human pangenomics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Genomics Institute. Miga added that the new effort was a more inclusive and “equitable” approach. The new pangenome could help scientists identify influential genetic differences that have flown under the radar because of limitations of the old reference sequence. Researchers behind the project say it has the potential to contribute to personalized, precision medicine — the development of medical care that’s tailored to an individual’s genetic makeup. Such a powerful tool also raises important ethical questions over genetic privacy and whose data is included and how. The research group said it’s sensitive to those concerns. More than 100 scientists contributed as authors to the research papers describing the work. The scientists, who are calling themselves the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, plan to ultimately include genetic samples from about 350 people in the reference. The data will be publicly available and shared openly. To build the pangenome, scientists used data from the 1000 Genomes Project, which included participants from across ethnic groups. The data is anonymous, meaning that some steps have been taken to protect the identities of those whose DNA is on display. The scientists said the 47 people used in this project represent a diverse geographic distribution across different human populations. Researchers and clinicians typically use the human genome reference as a baseline with which to compare a subject’s DNA and to scrutinize it for key differences that could indicate things like a genetic disease trigger. It has limitations: The original reference genome introduces bias, and its performance isn’t equal in all groups of people, the researchers said. The scientists hope the pangenome reference will improve performance and make it more inclusive. “By sampling broadly across the genetic tree of humanity, it benefits everybody,” said Ira Hall, a professor who is part of the research group and is the director of the Yale Center for Genomic Health at Yale University. The new pangenome takes up about 3 gigabytes of space on a computer. The researchers have developed algorithms that reference, map and search within the pangenome’s structure. In the immediate future, the consortium expects that the expanded scope of the reference will help scientists better study particular genes. This research follows another recent landmark moment in genomics. Last year, scientists announced that they had finally sequenced a human genome in its entirety, including the extremely repetitive and complex pieces of DNA that had left them in the dark for decades. Both of these breakthroughs were made possible by the advance of new technology that can perform much longer reads of DNA, which eliminates much of the puzzle work involved in matching together short fragments of genetic code. The pangenome research does raise concerns about privacy, representation and over who controls genomic information. Sleuth scientists examining previous genome projects found that it was possible to identify the names of subjects based on published data that was shared publicly after they consented to share it with researchers. Genetic research includes a history of concern over mistreatment, exploitation and a lack of engagement in indigenous and tribal communities. The research group members said they are committed to respecting tribes and groups that have formal policies against contributing genomic data to their project and “not to work around issues of data sovereignty,” said Eimear Kenny, director of the institute for genomic health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who is an author on the research.

"Screen all women for breast cancer at 40, instead of 50, new guidelines say",Aria Bendix,"May 9, 2023, 3:00 PM UTC",Women's Health,"Women should get screened for breast cancer every other year starting at age 40, according to draft guidance issued Tuesday by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. That's earlier than the independent panel of experts previously recommended: The last guidance, from 2016, suggested biennial screenings starting at age 50, but noted that women in their 40s could talk to their doctor about getting screened, particularly if they have a family history of breast cancer. Screenings usually involve a mammogram, which is an X-ray image of the breast. The change is the result of new scientific evidence, the task force said. The rate of breast cancer among women ages 40 to 49 increased 2% per year, on average, from 2015 to 2019, according to the National Cancer Institute. The task force estimated that the new recommendations could prevent at least one additional breast cancer death for every 1,000 women. ""With our new recommendation, it saves 20% more lives across the board for all women,"" said Dr. Wanda Nicholson, the task force's vice chair. She added that the recommendation does not apply to women with a personal history of breast cancer, those who've had an abnormality on a previous biopsy, women exposed to chest radiation at a young age or those with a genetic marker for breast cancer, who may need to be screened more frequently. But many radiologists think the recommendations don't go far enough. “They’re taking a step in the right direction, but I do worry about the every-other-year timing,"" said Dr. Melissa Durand, an associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging. ""Annual screening is going to catch the most amount of cancers when they’re at their smallest sizes and when treatment can be most effective,"" she said. ""We will miss cancers if we screen every other year."" Many other medical groups already recommend annual screenings before age 50, including the American Cancer Society and the American College of Radiology, which recommends yearly screenings starting at 40. In 2019, around 60% of women ages 40 to 49 reported having a mammogram within the past two years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We disagree with the U.S. task force in so many different ways,” said Dr. Stamatia Destounis, chair of the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Commission. The group issued guidelines last week recommending that all women have a conversation with their doctor by age 25 to determine if they need to be screened earlier in life. It also recommended that women with dense breasts, a breast cancer diagnosis before age 50 or a personal history of breast cancer get an MRI each year. Durand said most radiologists follow the American College of Radiology's recommendations. But primary care doctors may look to the task force to know when to refer patients for mammograms, and insurers often follow the panel's recommendations to determine which costs to cover. Right now, insurance companies cover annual mammograms for women who want them, but some radiologists worry that could change. Screening every other year won't do much to decrease disparities in breast cancer outcomes, according to Dr. Phoebe Freer, chief of breast imaging at the University of Utah's Huntsman Cancer Institute. Black women are 40% more likely than white women to die from breast cancer. Nicholson said much of that disparity is due to inequities in the health care system, such as a lack of timely follow-up after screenings or uneven access to treatment. But the task force ultimately determined that the risks of annual mammograms — including false positives and unnecessary imaging or biopsies following a scan — outweighed the benefits, she said. Radiologists also questioned why the task force did not recommend annual screenings for women with dense breasts, which make it harder to detect cancer. ""If you have a mammogram and it shows that you have dense breast tissue, you should get a mammogram every year and you should have some form of supplemental screening, whether it's by ultrasound or MRI,"" Durand said. Nicholson said the task force ""really looked deep"" for evidence that women with dense breasts required separate guidelines but couldn't find it. Although the task force's recommendations weigh the benefits of detecting cancer against the risks of annual scans — including radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies — radiologists consider those risks to be relatively small. Durand said the advanced mammogram technology widely used now is unlikely to show a false positive. And only around 1% to 2% of women who get screened end up needing a biopsy, Freer said. She added that doctors are likely to detect abnormal growths that aren't cancerous whether women are screened annually or biennially. Most women, Freer said, ""are willing to take the risk of being recalled for additional imaging to then be told that they’re OK."" "
Stressed out and burned out: Younger nurses feel strain of nursing shortage,Erika Edwards,"May 8, 2023, 10:07 PM UTC",Health news,"It's unusual for Emma Cooper, a nurse who cares for women after they've given birth, to be proud of the work she does every day. ""To have a patient sitting in front of me crying because they feel that they haven't been taught how to feed their baby is so upsetting,"" Cooper, of Portland, Maine, said. The explanation for the lapse in guidance is simple: ""None of us had time."" Cooper and her nursing colleagues at Maine Medical Center have so many patients that they are unable to focus appropriately on any single one, she said. Nurses nationwide are overworked, overloaded with patients and, quite frankly, over it all. There are not enough nurses in the workforce to ease the problem. And it's younger nurses, like Cooper, 27, who are sounding the alarm. ""Imagine trying your hardest every day at work, and you're barely scratching the surface of usefulness,"" Cooper said. ""Then you get in your car and cry."" Cooper's frustrations mirror the findings of a survey published last week of more than 18,200 registered nurses. The survey from AMN Healthcare, a health care staffing agency, was riddled with evidence of a stressed out, burned out nursing population. ""Our survey data illustrates the growing dissatisfaction and wellbeing struggles among nurses — and the workforce challenges that this is escalating,"" Landry Seedig, AMN Healthcare's chief operating officer, said in an email to NBC News. The findings show a recent drop in job satisfaction that had remained over 80% for a decade. In 2023, 71% of survey respondents said they were satisfied with their nursing career. Younger nurses were much less satisfied with their careers and jobs compared to older generations, and were least likely to recommend the job to others. Just 42% of Gen Zers and 43% of millennials said they would encourage their peers to pursue nursing as a career, compared with 62% of baby boomers. But signs of dissatisfaction were apparent in the majority of nurses surveyed. More than three-quarters said they felt emotionally drained, up from 62% in 2021. And 70% of respondents in 2023 said they worried that their job is hazardous to their health, compared with 51% during the height of the pandemic in 2021. The latest survey also showed that more than half of surveyed nurses felt unappreciated and often felt like quitting. Among the biggest issues, nurses say, is the large number of patients they must care for each day. Spencer Paddyaker, 28, is an emergency room nurse in the Dallas area. A typical shift has him caring for at least six patients at once. Each of those patients may need help at the same time. One needs assistance getting to the bathroom. Another is having chest pain and is frightened about what it means. Another patient has questions about the medications they've been prescribed. ""All these things, piece by piece, are fine. It's when they start to happen all at once that it becomes cumbersome,"" Paddyaker said. ""While you're addressing the person who is very sick or demands your attention immediately, your other patients start to feel a little blown off and neglected."" Last week, Cooper urged the Legislature in her home state of Maine to pass a bill that would set minimum requirements for nurse-to-patient ratios. Cooper is involved with National Nurses United, a union that represents registered nurses. The state does not have a law limiting the number of patients each nurse can care for during each shift. Only California has passed a law mandating a minimum nurse-to-patient ratio. ""We need more nurses at the bedside,"" Cooper said. ""My patients deserve better."" Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, a 26-year nursing veteran and president of American Nurses Association, remembers ""working 12 hour shifts and not going to the bathroom or getting anything to drink."" ""That should have never been accepted as normal,"" she said, adding that she is proud of this generation ""for not putting up with what I put up with."" ""They're holding us accountable for an environment that we allowed to happen for a very long time,"" Kennedy said. Bernadette Melnyk, dean of the College of Nursing at The Ohio State University, said that ""nurses have a huge long history of taking great care of everybody else, but they often don't prioritize their own self care."" ""We've got a population of about 5 million nurses that overall isn't so healthy,"" she said. Job satisfaction among nurses was higher during the height of the pandemic than it is now. In 2021, 48% of nurses said they were ""extremely satisfied"" with their job, compared to 33% in 2023, the AMN Healthcare survey showed. ""As Covid patients started to decrease, we started to get people coming back to the hospital who held off their medical treatments"" during the pandemic, Kennedy said. ""Now they're even sicker than they would have normally been. Nurses didn't get a break."" Nearly 9 in 10 nurses said the nursing shortage is worse than it was five years ago, the survey found. Nearly all respondents — 94% — said there is a severe or moderate shortage of nurses in their area. National Nurses United balks at the idea of a true shortage. ""There is only a shortage of nurses willing to work in environments that risk their licenses and the safety of their patients,"" the Union wrote in a media statement. In January, thousands of nurses in New York City went on strike, demanding in part an increase in staffing to ease a shortage that's being felt nationwide. Cooper, who is part of a union, said that while she has the deepest admiration for her health care co-workers, she and her peers deserve time and flexibility to focus on their patients. She has advice for other nurses frustrated by their workload. ""Stand up, use your voice,"" Cooper said. ""You know how to be an advocate already; you do it everyday for your patients. It's time for you to do it for yourself."" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
Hundreds of Hawaii residents rely on bottled water ever since 'forever chemicals' were found in their wells,Aria Bendix,"May 7, 2023, 11:15 AM UTC",Health news,"Around 650 Hawaii residents have been relying on bottled water since March, after the state health department detected synthetic chemicals, known as PFAS, in the local water system. The contamination dates back to at least October, when Hawaii’s Department of Health detected the chemicals in one of two wells that serve Kunia Village, an affordable housing development on O'ahu. The department announced in January that the levels detected exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed limit for two types of PFAS — called PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water, as well as Hawaii’s state limit, above which communities are expected to treat their water systems or provide an alternative source. The concentration is under the current EPA limit, however. Kunia Village stopped using the contaminated well after that. Then in early March, the water system’s operator started dispensing bottled water to residents out of concern that the second well might also be contaminated, which health department tests confirmed last week. Residents were instructed to use bottled water for drinking or brushing teeth and tap water for washing hands, doing laundry or taking baths. “We just felt it’s important to act quickly and conservatively,” said Stephanie Whalen, president of the Kunia Water Association. PFAS stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, but they're more often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they're nearly impossible to destroy so can linger permanently in air, water and soil. The class of chemicals is associated with health consequences, including low birth weight, high cholesterol and thyroid disease. PFOA, in particular, has been linked to an increased risk of kidney cancer. A study published last year found that exposure to high levels of PFOS was associated with an increased risk of liver cancer. PFAS are used in the manufacturing of consumer products such as food wrappers, cosmetics and textiles because of ​​their ability to resist stains, grease and water. They're also found at some military sites due to the use of a PFAS-based firefighting foam dating back to the 1970s. The military still uses the foam to respond to emergencies but has stopped using it for testing and training. PFAS contamination in water is widespread across the U.S. The Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization focused on toxic chemicals, told NBC News that at least 1,500 sites would violate EPA’s proposed PFAS limits for drinking water — 4 parts per trillion — which the agency hopes to finalize by the end of this year. The EPA, meanwhile, said in March that up to 6,300 water systems — serving as many as 94 million people — contain levels of PFAS above its proposed limits. “There are very few places we’ve looked for PFAS and not found them,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicology professor at East Carolina University who reviewed the water sampling results from Kunia Village. “That’s just a testament to just how pervasive they are in the environment.” But Kunia’s levels are higher than the average background concentrations found across the country, according to Anna Reade, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. “This is a pretty alarming level that they’re picking up,” Reade said. In one Kunia Village well, PFOA levels were up to double the EPA’s proposed limit, and PFOS levels were up to 3.5 times higher. In the other, PFOA levels were around five to seven times higher than the proposed threshold, and PFOS levels were at least 11 times higher. “It hits all of the marks of being too contaminated for people to drink safely,” Reade said. Hawaii’s health department said it has been testing small water systems located near probable PFAS hot spots — such as industrial or military sites — with the help of grant money from the EPA. Kunia Village is one such site, the department said, but added that it did not know how long PFAS were present in the area's water before the tests in October. “The major concern is, people may have been consuming this for many, many years — maybe even decades,” DeWitt said. Testing for PFAS is becoming more common, though: The Safe Drinking Water Act requires large public water systems — and some medium and smaller ones — to screen for the chemicals through 2025 and report results through the following year. The type of monitoring that Hawaii is doing is voluntary, Reade said, but over the next few years, ""we will get quite a bit more information on what we’re facing in our drinking water."" Individual water systems respond to high levels of PFAS in different ways. Some provide bottled water temporarily, but Reade said that many also employ long-term solutions like connecting to a new water source or installing a specialized treatment system. It can take a while for communities to decide on or implement such solutions, however. The town of Emmaus, Pennsylvania, for example, is still weighing its options more than a year after elevated PFAS levels were detected in its water. The source of the contamination in Kunia Village hasn’t been identified, but the health department said the PFAS compounds detected appear to match those from other sites with known contamination from firefighting foam. DeWitt, too, said that in Kunia Village's case, “it seems as if the sources are military sources, as opposed to an industrial source or a landfill.” The health department said it is waiting on the Army, which owns one of the wells, to provide more information. The U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii said it does not know the source of the contamination but is investigating whether PFAS-containing materials may have been stored, used or released at military sites nearby. In April, Whalen said, Kunia Village started running water from a different source through the water line to flush out the contamination. It's waiting on results of more recent tests. ""Those results come back clean, great. We'll stop bottled water. They don't, then we continue bottled water,"" Whalen said. Low levels of PFAS have been detected in several water systems in Honolulu this year as well. Reade said it's not surprising given the state's history of military activity. ""I think it will, unfortunately, be an issue that Hawaii will have to deal with beyond a few wells,"" she said. "

CDC switching gears on Covid tracking,Erika Edwards,"April 28, 2023, 10:05 PM UTC / Updated May 5, 2023, 10:10 PM UTC",Coronavirus,"While images of ICUs filled with Covid patients struggling to breathe may remain a haunting image of the early pandemic years, the public health emergency is coming to a close. Not only did the World Health Organization declare Friday that Covid is no longer a global threat, the United States is set to wind down public health emergency protections on May 11. As part of the end of the public health emergency in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will stop tracking levels of Covid spreading in communities around the country. The new focus will rely mostly on hospitalizations, according to two CDC reports released Friday. The change in how the CDC reports Covid data comes as ""99 plus percent of the population is in a low community level,"" Dr. Brendan Jackson, head of the CDC's Covid-19 Response, said during a media briefing Thursday. The agency will cease using a color-coded system that's been in place on its Covid Data Tracker since February 2022. The system indicates high, medium or low transmission of Covid, county by county. As most people use rapid, at-home Covid tests which don't get reported to states or the CDC, it has become difficult to get an accurate view of how much virus is causing mild infections. When the public health emergency ends on May 11, jurisdictions around the country will no longer be required to report testing data to the CDC. ""Without those testing data, that Covid community level map will shift to a map that's really driven by our data around hospital admissions,"" Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC's principal deputy director, told NBC News. While the public health emergency is winding down, there are still more than 1,000 people dying of Covid in the U.S. each week and almost 9,000 Covid patients in the hospital, according to CDC data. It is hospitalization information that matters most to public health officials. This indicates when a virus has evolved to a point when the most vulnerable in a population are becoming sicker and need more robust care. Moving forward, hospitalized Covid patients will be the main indicator of trends, the reports' authors wrote. This includes visits to emergency departments that result in Covid diagnoses. ""Functionally, that's all we've been really looking at for quite some time,"" said Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease expert and an associate professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. The CDC's new tracking, Wolfe said, ""is the right thing to do."" In 2020, ""our goal was to count every snowflake,"" Shah said, referring to each case of Covid. Three years later, ""we don't need to be out there counting every snowflake. We can just take a ruler out and understand how much snow has fallen."" Covid-related deaths will also be calculated, based on death certificate data. And PCR testing from about 450 laboratories across the country will be taken into consideration for tracking — searching for any blips or early rises in activity. Because the Covid virus continues to evolve, the CDC will keep tracking wastewater samples covering 40% of the population. ""This gives us an early look at what might be coming down the pike,"" including potential new variants, Shah said. ""When you take these metrics all together, our insight into what's happening with Covid doesn't really change."" Most Americans won't notice the change in daily lives. ""For a lot of folks out there, these changes to the data won't affect the ways that they go about their day to day lives, or the decisions that they make"" in mitigating further spread of the virus, Shah said. Even in areas with low levels of spread, the CDC recommends staying up to date with Covid vaccinations. The agency recently signed off on a second round of booster shots for people ages 65 and older. Whether it's Covid or any other virus, infectious disease experts maintain diligence in stopping the spread. ""The most important thing from a public health standpoint is about infection control,"" said Dr. Sadiya Khan, an epidemiologist at Northwestern Medicine. ""Those are things like washing our hands, making sure that people who are having symptoms like fevers and coughs and are actively ill are quarantining in their home and not out in public."" According to the CDC's tracker, the average number of weekly cases has been falling steadily since early January. As of May 3, the weekly average was 77,294 cases. Shah issued a stark reminder: Covid is still among us. ""Even though the public health emergency may be coming to a close,"" he said, ""CDC's work around Covid-19 hasn't come to an end.""

FDA appears skeptical about over-the-counter birth control pill,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"May 5, 2023, 6:48 PM UTC",Women's Health,"Food and Drug Administration scientists on Friday expressed skepticism about whether the birth control pill can be switched from prescription to over-the-counter. The assessment by FDA staff, included in briefing documents published Friday, comes ahead of a two-day meeting scheduled for next week, when the agency’s advisers will vote on whether to recommend that the agency allow a birth control pill called Opill to be sold over-the-counter. If the advisers recommend it and the FDA goes on to approve Opill for over-the-counter use, it would be the first time the pill could be sold without a prescription. HRA Pharma, which makes Opill, expects the agency could make a final decision by the end of the summer. Whether women can follow the package's instruction label and take the medication correctly seemed a chief concern of the FDA scientists, who doubted whether the pill maker had provided sufficient data. Birth control pills must be taken at the same time every day. Failure to do so could lead to an unintended pregnancy, agency scientists wrote. But missing doses is not uncommon: Studies have shown that about half of women report missing a dose at least once a month. The FDA approved Opill for prescription use in 1973. As part of the company’s application for over-the-counter use, the agency requested additional information about the drug’s effectiveness in today’s population. The updated analysis provided by the company, however, fell short, FDA scientists said, noting that it was based on low quality studies, many of which dated to the 1960s and '70s. FDA staff also questioned the findings from another study, called Access, in which researchers assessed whether participants took the drug according to the label’s instructions. The study found that about 97% of the time participants reported taking the drug correctly or following the label’s instructions if a dose was missed. The agency, however, said it found that “a substantial portion” of participants overreported the number of pills they took or reported taking more pills than were dispensed — factors that “call into question the reliability of all of the actual use data.” In a statement released in response to the FDA’s briefing documents, a spokesperson for Perrigo, which owns HRA Pharma, maintained that Opill is safe and effective for over-the-counter use. “Daily birth control was approved more than 60 years ago and progestin-only pills have a long track record as a safe and effective method to prevent pregnancy,” the spokesperson said. “We look forward to presenting our data and having a meaningful discussion on these topics on May 9 and May 10.” Dr. Melissa Simon, a professor of clinical gynecology at Northwestern University, said she had not yet reviewed the FDA's conclusions Friday, but stressed that birth control pills like Opill are very safe. ""The chance of harm happening from taking one pill every day from an over-the-counter access standpoint, it's very low harm,"" she said. ""You can harm yourself with other over-the-counter medications in the aisles of a pharmacy or local drug store much more than you can with these Opills."" She noted that birth control pills are already available over the counter in more than 100 countries. The push for easier access to birth control comes amid a changing political landscape for women’s reproductive rights. Last June, the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court in April rejected a lower court’s decision to issue a nationwide injunction on the drug mifepristone, one of two medications used in medication abortions. That case is still working its way through the lower courts, with the 5th Circuit scheduled to hear oral arguments on May 17. HRA Pharma is asking the FDA to approve the over-the-counter birth control pill for all women of reproductive age. Making the pill available without an age restriction could be especially important for younger teens and adults who often have a lot of barriers to accessing health care and getting birth control prescriptions, said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Among 15 to 17 year olds in the United States, 72% of pregnancies were unintended, according to data provided by the FDA. Other contraceptives, like condoms, involve the active participation of the women’s partner. Brandi declined to comment on the FDA's conclusions in the briefing documents. In Friday’s documents, the FDA noted that in a prescription setting, progestin-only medications have been demonstrated to be safe. The agency noted that there is a risk of breast cancer and undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, and said it planned to ask the advisory committees next week whether they think consumers will be able to evaluate those safety risks for themselves. (These risks are common among hormonal birth control medications.) Agency staff also noted that there was a lack of information on use in adolescents and whether they could follow the label’s instructions. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
Small study points to possible cause of myocarditis following mRNA vaccination in young men,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"May 5, 2023, 6:02 PM UTC",Health news,"An overactive immune response to the mRNA Covid vaccines may be the culprit in rare cases of heart inflammation seen in some young men after they receive the shot, a small study published Friday in the journal Science Immunology suggests. The study was based on 23 patients ages 13 to 21 who developed myocarditis after their second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. An analysis of blood samples from nine of these patients — all of whom had gotten Pfizer — found elevated cytokine levels. Cytokines help coordinate the body’s immune response to pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and other invading microbes, as well as vaccines. But at too high levels, cytokines can trigger a rapid expansion of white blood cells that are capable of causing inflammation. That’s what appears to be happening in some young men who develop myocarditis or pericarditis — two types of heart inflammation — after getting the Covid vaccine. “It’s a little bit of a double-edged sword,” said senior study author Carrie Lucas, an associate professor of immunobiology at Yale University School of Medicine. The vaccinated individuals mount a strong immune response, she said, but that response is also causing “cells to overreact and cause tissue inflammation.” The researchers found no evidence that antibodies that target the virus’s spike protein played a role in heart inflammation. Previous research had suggested that such antibodies may also bind to proteins in the heart tissue, causing inflammation. “Our findings point to inflammation-induced heart damage,” said Yale immunologist Akiko Iwasaki, another author on the study, “and rule out elevated levels of anti-spike antibodies in patients.” Despite the study's small size, Dr. Ofer Levy, the director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children's Hospital, was optimistic about the findings. The research, he said, could provide insight into developing treatments for vaccine-induced myocarditis. There are currently no drugs for the condition, though most people fully recover on their own. “The better we understand what the vaccine is doing, the better we can build a better mousetrap,” said Levy, who was not involved in the study. Dr. Leslie Cooper, the chair of the cardiology department at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said the study, though small, is “an important contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms” of vaccine-induced myocarditis in young men. Cooper was also not involved with the new research. The findings, he said, suggest that one potential treatment for the inflammation could be a drug that targets the body's excess immune response after vaccination. Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining of the heart) following Covid vaccination is very rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of March 2, there have been 376 confirmed cases of myocarditis in children ages 12 to 15 after more than 25 million vaccine doses were administered, according to the agency. In teens ages 16 and 17, there have been 316 confirmed cases after more than 14 million vaccine doses were administered. Most cases that do occur are in male teens and young adults, usually after the second dose of a primary series of either the original version of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. Those vaccines, however, are no longer in use in the U.S. after the Food and Drug Administration switched to the updated bivalent formula and moved away from a two-dose primary series. A CDC study published in January that looked at children ages 5 to 11 found no cases of myocarditis following a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine. The patients included in the new analysis had not previously had Covid before they were vaccinated. All experienced symptoms of heart inflammation one to four days after their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Although the analysis only looked at the Pfizer vaccine, Levy said it’s reasonable to extrapolate the findings to the Moderna vaccine, which also uses mRNA technology. Other vaccines and viral infections can also cause myocarditis, Iwasaki said. Myocarditis has been reported in a small number of people who received the Novavax Covid vaccine, which doesn't use mRNA technology. And Covid itself is more likely to cause heart inflammation than mRNA vaccination. While the study helps explain what is driving the inflammation in people who got an mRNA vaccine, a number of questions remain. The findings don’t explain why the inflammation only appears to affect the heart and not other organs, Lucas, the senior study author, said. Nor do they explain why the condition affects men more than women. The study also doesn’t give insight into what long-term health problems — if any — people may experience following vaccine-induced myocarditis, which is often milder than the kind caused by viral or bacterial infections. Pfizer and Moderna are both conducting long-term clinical trials to track possible health issues in the years following a diagnosis of vaccine-associated heart problems in teens and young adults. Some people who’ve developed myocarditis after a viral infection can develop scarring in the heart, reducing its ability to pump blood and circulate oxygen around the body. Lucas said the findings support earlier recommendations from the CDC for males ages 12 to 39 to wait up to eight weeks before getting their second dose of the primary series as a way to reduce the risk of myocarditis. She added that the study could also help to identify biomarkers that could measure whether someone might be at risk for heart inflammation following vaccination. The researchers said they hope larger trials will confirm their findings, although they noted that finding more participants could be difficult as the condition is very rare. “We were really motivated to understand this rare vaccine-associated myocarditis to hopefully make it even more rare in the future,” Lucas said.

TikTok users slam recent weight loss trend videos as fatphobic,Uwa Ede-Osifo,"May 5, 2023, 5:52 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"A TikTok trend in which users pretend to show “before and after” weight loss photos is being criticized by some as fatphobic. Using the popular editing tool CapCut, trend participants have been applying an effect called ""Big Face"" to make their faces appear larger. Then they export the modified image to TikTok for a comparison video: the Big Face selfie versus the original selfie, with the label ""What I would look like if I lost 100lbs."" In other words, the ""after"" images are actually photos of how the users currently look. The videos have been met with criticism by some online who say the trend mocks plus-sized individuals and stigmatizes weight gain. “People who are relatively in shape are making fun of fat people,"" said Julia Barberi, 31, who posted a critical video about the trend on TikTok. ""It’s a terrible filter. There are no positives. When we constantly see things about losing weight in the media, it just encourages the point that we aren’t enough as is."" The trend comes as some users on TikTok continue to grapple with body issues and eating disorders, a problem that has also been an issue on Instagram and Snapchat. On TikTok, posts on For You Pages can hit users unexpectedly with information about diet and exercise. Also, a range of inspirational lifestyle content, usually ""get ready with me"" series or ""outfit of the day"" videos, can be met with comments of users disparaging their own bodies or comparing themselves to other creators. A few months ago, a TikTok “bloated” filter received similar backlash. TikTok users posted videos with a double chin, before the video would transition to reveal their true face. Other filters that modify people’s faces or bodies have also sparked debate on how they could contribute to body dysphoria or self-esteem problems. A spokesperson for TikTok did not immediately respond to request for comment. TikTok user Dominique Navarro said at first she thought the ""What I would look like if I lost 100lbs"" videos were meant to be positive. “Like many people in the comments of these videos I found myself initially impressed, went to the posters' profile and then quickly realized a filter was used to make them appear fat,” said Navarro, who documents her weight loss journey and discusses fitness on her TikTok account. “I then realized many of the encouraging comments were just satire."" The comments section of videos participating in the recent trend have generated a wide range of reactions. Some users, not realizing this was a joke, offered encouragement and shared anecdotes about their own weight loss journeys. “you got this I’m currently struggling too,” one commenter in a response to a video. The video's creator replied, “You got this as well! It’s a trend but I hope you reach your goals <3.” Others called out the videos for being tone-deaf. “This trend will never be funny how do you guys not understand that?” one individual said. “It’s weird,” another wrote. “Editing yourself to look a certain way so that your original self looks ‘better’ & you get compliments.” Navarro said she believes trends like this can be harmful for people struggling with weight or eating disorders. “A majority of people are fatphobic whether they realize it or not,” Navarro said. “People seem to believe being fat is the worst thing you could possibly be in the world, and as someone who has been fat & within a healthy weight range, I know that's not true."" If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, contact The National Eating Disorders Association at 1-800-931-2237 during select hours, text NEDA to 741741 at any hour in a crisis, or visit NEDA’s website.

WHO declares end to Covid global health emergency,Aria Bendix,"May 5, 2023, 1:41 PM UTC / Updated May 5, 2023, 2:32 PM UTC",Coronavirus,"Covid is no longer a global public health emergency, the World Health Organization said Friday. The WHO issued the declaration more than three years ago, on Jan. 30, 2020. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he made the decision following a recommendation from the WHO’s emergency committee, which met on Thursday for the 15th time. ""I have accepted that advice,"" Tedros said. ""It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency."" The WHO's designation of a ""public health emergency of international concern"" is reserved for the most serious disease outbreaks. The organization has assigned the label to seven outbreaks since 2007: monkeypox, Covid, Zika, H1N1 flu, polio and Ebola (which has twice been designated an emergency). Globally, Covid deaths have fallen steadily over the last three months, from more than 41,000 weekly deaths at the start of January to around 3,500 on April 24, according to WHO data. “For more than a year, the pandemic has been on a downward trend, with population immunity increasing from vaccination and infection, mortality decreasing and the pressure on health systems easing. This trend has allowed most countries to return to life as we knew it before Covid-19,” Tedros said on Friday. However, he noted that worldwide, someone died of Covid every three minutes last week — a figure that only includes reported deaths. “The worst thing any country could do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,” Tedros said. The U.S. is set to end its Covid public health emergency on Thursday. The designation has been in place since January 2020. President Joe Biden signed a resolution into law last month ending the country's Covid national emergency. Weekly deaths in the U.S. have reached similar levels to those recorded in March 2020. The country is seeing around 158 daily deaths, on average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""What this news means is that it is time for countries to transition from emergency mode to managing Covid-19 alongside other infectious diseases,"" Tedros said on Friday. "
Kindergartner dies amid an outbreak of unidentified illnesses at Detroit school,Aria Bendix,"May 4, 2023, 10:19 PM UTC",Kids' Health,"Public health officials in Detroit are investigating an outbreak of unidentified illnesses at an elementary and middle school after a kindergartner died. The Detroit Public Schools Community District said Wednesday that the school, Marcus Garvey Academy, ""has experienced an unusually high rate of flu-like symptoms including student fevers, and vomiting, namely at the early grade levels."" The kindergarten student's cause of death has not been confirmed, so it is not yet known whether it was related to the outbreak. The Detroit Health Department said in a statement Wednesday that it has not confirmed the cause of the illnesses. It told parents and caregivers to be on the lookout for several symptoms, including fever, headache, lethargy, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, among children ages 4 to 7. Garvey Academy will be closed through Monday for deep cleaning, the statement said. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services referred questions about the outbreak to the Detroit Health Department, which did not respond to requests for comment. Wayne County did not immediately respond to inquiries, either. Dr. Kevin Dazy, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Michigan, said the continued circulation of respiratory viruses — which tend to peak in the winter — could still be driving outbreaks in schools. Detroit is still experiencing winter weather, he noted, which has prompted kids to spend more time indoors this spring. “Sure, this is a little bit later in the season. By no means is it unheard of that we may see another wave of any viral respiratory illness,” Dazy said. He said that his hospital has not seen any patients connected to the Garvey Academy outbreak but that the school's reported illnesses did not surprise him. “When you’re in a confined area, such as a classroom, of course that can make one child very contagious to the other kids in the class,” he said. Dazy added that it is hard to know why the source of the outbreak has not been identified yet but noted that doctors often test less for respiratory viruses during off-peak seasons, which could delay diagnoses. In a separate incident this week, a Detroit day care facility temporarily closed Wednesday for deep cleaning because of an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease. The day care, Focus: HOPE Center for Children, said it had identified 17 cases as of Tuesday. But the disease is mild, and it is unlikely to be related to the outbreak at Garvey Academy. Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads easily through droplets from coughs or sneezes or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. It is common in infants and children younger than 5, with symptoms that usually include fever, mouth sores and a skin rash. The day care is scheduled to reopen Monday. "
"After $3 million worth of kratom is seized, FDA continues to warn of its dangers",Kaitlin Sullivan,"May 4, 2023, 3:40 PM UTC",Health news,"Last week, U.S. marshals seized an estimated $3 million worth of kratom that was being sold as a supplement by an Oklahoma-based company. It’s not the first time that authorities have seized kratom, which is considered a “drug of concern” by the Food and Drug Administration. The incident, however, highlights the ongoing demand for the drug, even as the FDA continues to warn about its potential dangers. Kratom is a plant that grows naturally in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and has a long history of use in Southeast Asia. In the U.S. it’s not approved for any purpose, but millions of Americans take it for myriad reasons, saying it boosts energy, treats pain and anxiety, provides a high and even relieves symptoms of withdrawal from opioids. The FDA, however, maintains that the drug is unsafe. “There are no FDA-approved uses for kratom, nor have there ever been, and the agency has received concerning reports about the safety of kratom,” Lauren-Jei McCarthy, an FDA press officer, told NBC News in an emailed statement. In 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration moved to classify kratom as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it has no medical uses and has a high potential for abuse, but reversed course after public outcry. Kratom is still unregulated at the federal level, but five states have bans on the substance, according to the American Kratom Association, a group that advocates for kratom access in the U.S. In a statement from April 2022, the FDA warned the public against using kratom, or Mitragyna speciosa, which is the scientific name for the plant, saying that the substance “affects the same opioid brain receptors as morphine” and that it appears to have “properties that expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and dependence.” In the same statement, the agency said it was “actively evaluating all available scientific information on this issue and continues to warn consumers not to use any products labeled as containing the botanical substance kratom or its psychoactive compounds, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.” McCarthy said that in the year since that alert was issued, the agency has not come across any data that would warrant kratom’s approval as a drug. Dr. Alan Kaye, a professor of anesthesiology and pharmacology at LSU in Shreveport, Louisiana, said that “the concern is real.” “Kratom has a number of pharmacologic effects and one is through activating opioid receptors, Kaye said. “That gives an analgesic effect, but also can lead to addiction.” The molecules in kratom also bind to serotonin receptors and calcium blocking channels, he said, which prevents calcium from entering the cells of the heart and arteries, which is how medications used to lower blood pressure work. “When you have an herbal product like this, that is really used as an analgesic and also for psychoactive stimulation, it’s ripe for abuse,” Kaye said. “It’s not surprising that there are cases of toxicity and death and it’s a growing public health concern.” A 2022 study found that nearly one-third of people in the U.S. who use kratom met the criteria for kratom use disorder, which included increased use, tolerance, withdrawal, unsuccessful quit attempts and craving. In recent years, research has also linked kratom to liver damage and death, but has also recognized the plant as a safer option for pain management than opioids. A 2021 review published in The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology noted that research found kratom can relieve pain and cause mild euphoria, with a lower risk of adverse respiratory and nervous system effects compared to traditional opioids. However, its use has been linked to liver toxicity, seizures and death. A 2020 study also found that kratom users in the U.S. are typically more prone to substance abuse than people who use cannabis, alcohol or cigarettes. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says on its website that adverse side effects from kratom are rare but serious, and include psychiatric, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. They note that a very small number of deaths have been linked to kratom and nearly all deaths involved other drugs or contaminants — which Kaye said is one of the major concerns with kratom in the U.S. Supplements and unregulated drugs do not have set standards or government-issued monitoring of their safety, and concerns over kratom’s purity and toxicity in the U.S. triggered the 2022 FDA alert. Four years earlier, the FDA had issued a mandatory recall of kratom products after a salmonella outbreak was linked to kratom sold by Triangle Pharmanaturals, LLC. “If it is ever studied to a point that the FDA puts its thumb of approval on it, it will be in a purified form and there will be data that shows its safety,” Kaye said. For now, the FDA continues to tell people not to take kratom. “The agency stands ready to evaluate data that could demonstrate evidence-based medicinal purpose for kratom,” McCarthy said. “However, to date, we are not aware of any evidence that would meet the agency’s standard for approval of kratom as a drug.” Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

"As colon cancer spreads in younger adults, new research identifies earliest symptoms",Erika Edwards,"May 4, 2023, 4:01 AM UTC",Health news,"Prolonged and unexplained bouts of diarrhea, stomachaches and spots of blood during bowel movements may be signs of early-onset colorectal cancer — a disease that's increasingly found in young adults not old enough to qualify for colonoscopies. The most troubling early symptom is rectal bleeding, a possible sign of colon cancer that's not comfortably discussed beyond the bathroom. ""It can be difficult or embarrassing to talk about,"" said Dr. Matthew Kalady, the director of the division of colon and rectal surgery at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""But the reality is everybody deals with something like this,"" and it's important to understand what's normal and what's not, he said. The new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, published Thursday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, included 5,075 people with early-onset colorectal cancer. The goal was to find symptoms that might give early signals of colorectal cancer, a disease that has been surging among younger people in recent years, with an troubling number not being diagnosed until advanced stages. According to the American Cancer Society, the proportion of colorectal cancer cases occurring in people under age 55 doubled from 1995 to 2019, from 11% to 20%. The new research found four distinct signals up to two years before a colorectal cancer diagnosis: Participants had at least one of those symptoms that began as early as two years before they were diagnosed. However, colonoscopies are recommended only at or after age 45. That means people may have symptoms long before they seek doctors' care or are ever diagnosed with colon cancer — a treatable disease if it's caught early, experts say. ""We kind of brush these things away as patients,"" said an author of the study, Dr. Cassandra Fritz, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology at the Washington University School of Medicine. Still, ""these symptoms should alarm you,"" Fritz said. ""Go see a doctor to get further evaluation."" Nearly half of the study participants experienced at least one of those symptoms three months before they were diagnosed. The risk for cancer diagnosis rose as additional symptoms popped up. The research highlights an “alarming problem” for young adults and the doctors who take care of them, said another author of the study, Yin Cao, an associate professor of surgery in the public health sciences division at Washington University School of Medicine. “We are sending a very clear message that young adults need to be aware of these symptoms,"" Cao said in an interview. The worry is that doctors, gastroenterologists and younger people are too often misdiagnosing or ignoring symptoms. “To date, many early-onset colorectal cancers are detected in emergency rooms, and there often are significant diagnostic delays with this cancer,"" Cao said in a statement. Symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain can be normal and fleeting. Experts said such symptoms lasting more than a week without any known cause warrant a call to the doctor. ""What I tell patients is if you have some diarrhea that resolves quickly, that's probably nothing to worry about,"" Fritz said. ""But if you notice that it's lasting for weeks or a month, that might be something to have a conversation about"" with your primary care doctor. Dr. William Dahut, the chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, urges people to pay attention to early symptoms that may indicate problems. ""If there's something that you feel that's out of the ordinary, push a little harder for more diagnostic tests,"" Dahut said. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
"FDA approves world's first RSV vaccine, a shot for adults ages 60 and up",Aria Bendix,"May 3, 2023, 5:12 PM UTC / Updated May 3, 2023, 5:46 PM UTC",Health news,"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the world's first RSV vaccine: a shot for adults ages 60 and up, made by pharmaceutical giant GSK. The milestone was decades in the making. Researchers first attempted to develop a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus roughly 60 years ago. In a late-stage clinical trial, the single-dose shot lowered the risk of symptomatic illness by 83% and of severe illness by 94%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must still recommend the vaccine before it becomes available to the public. A CDC advisory committee is scheduled to meet in June to discuss how the shot should be used. Dr. Phil Dormitzer, GSK’s senior vice president and global head of vaccines research and development, said the company is already manufacturing doses of the vaccine, to be sold under the brand name Arexvy. “The goal is to have shots available in the fall so that people can get them before the next RSV season coming up late fall and winter,” Dormitzer said, though he did not give specific production numbers. RSV causes a lower respiratory illness that is typically mild for healthy adults. But in serious cases, the virus can lead to pneumonia or bronchiolitis, which inflames airways and clogs them with mucus. Older people and infants are particularly at risk: RSV kills up to 10,000 people ages 65 or older and up to 300 children under 5 every year in the U.S. RSV cases typically peak between late December and mid-February, but cases last year started climbing in the summer as people left pandemic precautions behind. As of late April, the rate of RSV hospitalizations for the current season was around 51 per 100,000 people, according to the CDC. That's up from 19 hospitalizations per 100,000 people by the same point in the prior season. GSK’s trial showed that protection from its vaccine lasted at least six months. ""It’s not like you have to wait to the very last minute because it’s not going to last long enough,"" Dormitzer said. ""We know from studies we have done that getting a vaccine — for example, in the fall — should cover you through the next RSV season."" Dormitzer said the company's data also suggests it is safe to administer the RSV vaccine at the same time as a standard flu shot. But GSK is still studying whether the vaccine can be administered alongside high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines (shots with an added ingredient to encourage a better immune response), which are the types the CDC recommends for older adults. GSK’s trial is ongoing, so the company plans to keep collecting data  over the next two RSV seasons. It will also monitor people who receive the newly approved shot. So far, commonly reported side effects in the trial include injection site pain, fatigue and muscle pain. The FDA noted a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm) among vaccine recipients relative to the control group, and it identified one case of Guillain-Barré syndrome — a rare neurological disorder that damages nerve cells and causes muscle weakness or paralysis — that was potentially related to the vaccine. Dormitzer said it’s hard to know what to make of the Guillain-Barré case but added, “I would not say it’s a great concern at this point.” A panel of FDA advisers in March voted 10-2 in favor of approving the vaccine based on its safety and unanimously recommended the vaccine based on its efficacy. A second RSV vaccine for older adults, from Pfizer, is up for FDA approval later this month. The FDA advisory panel voted 7-4 to recommend that shot based on its safety and efficacy. Some members expressed concerns that not enough participants in Pfizer’s trial got infected with RSV to adequately assess the shot’s efficacy, and several worried about a potential association with Guillain-Barré. One man in Pfizer’s trial developed Guillain-Barré after he received the vaccine, and a woman developed Miller Fisher syndrome, a related, rare nerve disease. The FDA has asked Pfizer to conduct a study on the risk of Guillain-Barré after its vaccine is approved. Pfizer also tested a second application of its shot in pregnant people to help protect infants from RSV. The FDA is reviewing that data, with a decision likely in August. Dormitzer said GSK doesn't have further plans to study its shot among pregnant people after a previous trial involving a slightly different version of the vaccine showed a higher preterm birth rate among some vaccine recipients. However, GSK is studying its shot in people ages 50 to 59 — particularly those with underlying health issues. Dormitzer said that data should be available sometime after July. "
States threaten crackdown on copycat versions of Ozempic and Wegovy,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"May 3, 2023, 3:23 PM UTC",Health news,"A growing number of states are threatening to take legal action against pharmacies that make or dispense unauthorized versions of the weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy. At least four states are already curbing the manufacturing of copycat versions over safety concerns and more could soon follow, experts say, as the two medications soar in popularity in the U.S. Some compounding pharmacies in the U.S. have been offering what appears to be semaglutide — the active ingredient in both Ozempic and Wegovy — amid an ongoing shortage. Compounding pharmacies typically mix and alter drug ingredients to create medications tailored to specific patient needs. They are allowed to make compounded versions of commercially available drugs under special circumstances, like a shortage, according to the Food and Drug Administration. But state regulators that oversee pharmacies in Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and West Virginia say they are aware that some compounding pharmacists are using a different form of semaglutide that is not approved by the FDA, raising safety concerns. It's not clear if any consumer has been harmed by the compounded versions, but states are now threatening to crack down, each telling compounding pharmacies in recent weeks to stop making the unapproved versions of the drug or face legal and/or regulatory consequences. ""The Board is charged with protecting the public,"" the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy, which oversees pharmacies in the state, wrote in a statement published online on April 21. ""Therefore, compounding semaglutide drug products in a way that fails to conform with governing law may lead to enforcement action."" Joe Fontenot, executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy, told NBC News that the warnings do not mean compounding semaglutide is banned. The states communicated with compounding pharmacies ""to cease compounding with unapproved forms of semaglutide,"" he said. ""Compounding pharmacies may only compound drug products using bulk drug substances that comply with FDA guidelines."" But semaglutide is approved for use only in its ""base form,"" the FDA said in a letter to states, which can only be acquired from Novo Nordisk, the patent holder of Ozempic and Wegovy. That makes it nearly impossible for compounding pharmacies to make the drug because Novo Nordisk does not share the drug ingredients with compounding pharmacists, said Susan McCoy, executive director of the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy. Regulators are particularly concerned with medications that are made using semaglutide sodium salt, a cheaper and modified version of the compound that is used for scientific research but not intended for use in humans, Fontenot said. Jeremy Kahn, a spokesperson for the FDA, said semaglutide salt is not an ingredient in any FDA approved drugs. The compound can sometimes be found to purchase online as well as at spa and weight loss clinics. It is often cheaper and easier to access than the brand name Ozempic and Wegovy, which can cost around $1,000 or more for a month's supply. “Salt versions of medications aren’t always a bad thing,” said Jim Yawn, the owner of Uptown Pharmacy, a compounding pharmacy in Madison, Mississippi. “A lot of medications are actually in the form of salt for stability issues.” But Yawn, whose pharmacy does not make compounded semaglutide, said that the salt version of semaglutide — like many other substances not approved for use in the U.S. — isn’t regulated, monitored or tested by the FDA. That means patients may not always know what they are getting, he added. He noted that he once saw a document from a manufacturer meant to verify that the substance was indeed semaglutide and met the FDA’s standards for approval. The document looked “like something that was purchased on the Alibaba marketplace that was slid out the back doors of a Chinese chemical plant,” he said. The warning from state regulators means compounding pharmacists making unauthorized versions of Ozempic and Wegovy could face a fine, be put on probation or lose their license to dispense medications, said Rick Niemi, the CEO of Valor Compounding Pharmacy, which is based in California but ships medications to states nationwide. ""Revoking your licenses means you're literally out of business,"" said Niemi, whose pharmacy does not make compounded semaglutide. He said state pharmacy regulators take the selling of unapproved medications very seriously. ""This is not the candy business. It's the drug business,"" he said. So far, no compounding pharmacy has been fined or lost their license in Louisiana and Mississippi, according to state regulators. Fontenot said Louisiana had not yet taken any legal or regulatory action against compounding pharmacies in the state. Neither has Mississippi, McCoy said. The executive directors of the Boards of Pharmacy in North Carolina and in West Virginia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Al Carter, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, a nonprofit that represents state pharmacy regulators, said that it is not aware of any other states taking similar action. ""However, we do know that most states are investigating the compounding of this product outside of the federal guidelines for drugs listed on the FDA shortage list,"" he said. Allison Schneider, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic and Wegovy, said in a statement that the company is aware of several compounding pharmacies claiming to offer compounded semaglutide and is “taking action against these entities,"" though she did not provide further details. “We will not tolerate the unauthorized and inappropriate usage of our brand trademarks by third parties,” she said.

Brazilian police raid Bolsonaro’s home as part of Covid vaccine data investigation,Reuters,"May 3, 2023, 1:29 PM UTC",Coronavirus,"BRASILIA, Brazil — Brazil’s federal police on Wednesday raided former President Jair Bolsonaro’s home in Brasilia as part of a probe into a group suspected of adding false vaccine data into the government’s Covid database, two sources familiar with the matter said. Two of Bolsonaro’s closest aides, Mauro Cid and Max Guilherme, have been arrested in the same operation, the sources added. Federal police earlier in the day said in a statement they were serving 16 search and seizure warrants and six preventive arrest warrants in Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro as part of the operation, but did not disclose the names of those targeted. A spokesman and a lawyer for Bolsonaro did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Police said the “false data” were allegedly added to the database between November 2021 and December 2022, when Bolsonaro was president, to alter immunization statuses of still unnamed people. “As a result, they were able to issue vaccine certificates and use them to circumvent restrictions imposed by public authorities in Brazil and the United States,” police said, adding the group also had an “ideological reason” for doing so. Bolsonaro while in office was a vocal skeptic of Covid vaccines who vowed to never get the jab. "
Allergies in the sky: Airlines are pressed to treat severe reactions,Erika Edwards,"May 2, 2023, 9:58 PM UTC / Updated May 3, 2023, 12:47 AM UTC",Health news,"Lindsey Ulin wasn't feeling great when she boarded her flight from Phoenix to Austin, Texas, in early March. Ulin, 28, had just spent four days on vacation, hiking and enjoying the warm weather in Scottsdale, Arizona, with her mother and sister. Just before boarding their flight home, they had lunch at a little French restaurant at the airport. Ulin had a burger, fries and a side of Brussels sprouts — all food she'd eaten before without issue. But nausea soon crept in. ""I really thought it was just indigestion from eating lunch, and that it would get better on its own,"" Ulin said. The feeling did not go away once they were in the air. Hives popped up on her face and chest. She couldn't get enough air into her lungs. Panic followed. ""We were still 30 minutes away from landing and my family was having to sit there and helplessly watch as I struggled to breathe,"" Ulin said. ""Things were getting worse very quickly."" As a resident physician in internal medicine at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, Ulin recognized that she was experiencing a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. The condition can be deadly unless the person is given an emergency injection of epinephrine. It works by increasing blood flow throughout the body and relaxing muscles that block airways. The injection device, usually placed on the thigh, administers the medicine automatically and is designed to be user-friendly, even for children who have never used one. They come with clear instructions for use, often with audio help, and can be used immediately. But there wasn't an epinephrine auto-injector on board during Ulin's flight. The airline didn't carry one. None of the passengers did, either. And Ulin had no idea what had caused her allergic reaction. ""I accepted that I was probably going to die,"" she said. Medical emergencies on flights are not uncommon. A 2013 study found that dozens of such events occur on commercial flights each day in the United States. Most are related to stomach aches, anxiety or a feeling that a person is about to pass out. Some emergencies, however, are life-threatening. Commercial airlines are required to carry a basic set of medical tools, including aspirin, a stethoscope and devices used to help with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. The Federal Aviation Administration, however, does not require EpiPens, or epinephrine auto-injectors, on commercial flights, a lapse that frustrates allergists. “As someone who has frequently assisted in these emergency situations,” airlines should “absolutely” carry the auto-injectors, Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist and immunologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City, wrote in an email. Parikh is also a member of the Allergy & Asthma Network, an advocacy and research group. The airline emergency kits do carry epinephrine, but in vials that only trained medical professionals may be able to use in the event of a heart-related issue, for example. There is a growing movement to add epinephrine auto-injectors to address allergies on commercial airlines. ""I strongly advocate for this,"" said Dr. Tyler Barrett, an emergency medicine physician with Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. We need something ""that is designed for rapid, easy administration by a layperson."" In Ulin's anaphylaxis case, the flight attendant simply handed her a vial as Ulin was struggling to breathe. Ulin tried to break open the vial against the tray table in front of her, unsure of what to do next. A passenger walked up, identifying himself as a doctor who could administer the medicine with syringes he found in the airline's medical kit. ""I knew in that moment that this was going to be OK,"" Ulin said. Ulin described her frightening allergic reaction in a series of tweets in late April. She has not been able to figure out what caused her allergic reaction. Still, she now carries multiple epinephrine auto-injectors at all times. The Aerospace Medical Association recently advised the FAA that airlines should routinely carry epinephrine auto-injectors and other allergy medicines in doses for both adults and children. The agency is also considering updating the kits to include automated blood pressure cuffs and Narcan, which reverses the effects of opioid overdoses. ""The FAA is reviewing the emergency medical kit requirements,"" the agency said in a statement to NBC News. Travelers, even those who have never had allergies before, can avoid risk during flights by wiping down seats, armrests and tray tables upon boarding, Jenna Riemenschneider, senior director of advocacy and policy at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, said.

Why tuberculosis cases have risen in recent years after decades of decline,Aria Bendix,"May 2, 2023, 3:51 PM UTC",Health news,"After declining for nearly three decades, tuberculosis cases in the U.S. ticked up each year from 2020 to 2022. Cases rose more than 15% in that time, though the disease is still less prevalent than it was before the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 8,300 tuberculosis cases last year, compared to nearly 8,900 in 2019. Doctors who treat tuberculosis patients blame the pandemic for the rise in cases, since reduced access to medical care may have prevented some infections from being identified or delayed diagnoses long enough for a latent infection to progress to active disease. ""The number of tests done for TB dropped across the board in this country because everyone was busy looking for Covid,"" said Richard Chaisson, director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Tuberculosis Research. As a result, some newer cases of active tuberculosis could have been avoided, Chaisson said. Last week, a Maryland high school reported a new case, and a woman with tuberculosis in Washington has garnered attention since January because she has refused numerous orders to isolate or receive treatment. Other pandemic-related factors may also have hindered the disease's spread, according to Dr. Priya Shete, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco. Shete said it's possible that some ""public health measures that protected our communities from Covid also kept people from transmitting TB."" Travel restrictions may have also limited transmission temporarily, Chaisson added. Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that can spread through the air when a person with an active case of coughs, sneezes or speaks. Symptoms include a bad cough that lasts three weeks or longer, chest pain, or coughing up blood or phlegm, according to the CDC. But up to 13 million people in the U.S. have latent infections, meaning the bacteria is inactive and the host isn’t contagious and doesn’t have symptoms. Around 5% to 10% of those latent cases, if left untreated, will develop into active disease. The uptick in cases since 2020, though likely a blip in the overall downward trend, is a reminder of how important tuberculosis screenings are, according to Dr. Luke Davis, an associate professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health. ""If we could just get everyone who’s at risk screened once, that would be a huge public health victory,"" he said. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of disease experts, on Tuesday released its latest set of screening guidelines for tuberculosis. The recommendations are the same as the previous 2016 guidance: Groups at increased risk — including those in homeless shelters or correctional facilities and people who were born or previously lived in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis — should be screened for latent infections. Davis said the recommendations are primarily a way to encourage screenings and prompt insurance providers to cover the costs. But right now, Shete said, Medicare and Medicaid do not pay for screenings for latent tuberculosis. To screen for tuberculosis, doctors either administer a skin or blood test, though the latter is more common. The task force's recommendations don't specify how often people should be screened but note that it's reasonable to screen annually if a person is at continued risk of exposure. Shete said immigrants to the U.S. are disproportionately affected by tuberculosis, though they're screened for latent infections before entering the country. In 2020, more than 71% of all active tuberculosis cases in the U.S. were among people born outside the country, according to CDC data. More than half of new cases that year were among people born in Mexico, the Philippines, India, Vietnam or China. ""Unfortunately, screening and testing of the millions of at-risk individuals in immigrant communities estimated to be at risk for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is lagging,"" Shete and several colleagues wrote in an editorial in the journal JAMA on Tuesday. The editorial noted that around 80% of U.S. tuberculosis cases occur among racial or ethnic minority groups. Tuberculosis is 70 times more prevalent among Asian people in the U.S. who weren’t born in the country than among U.S.-born white people, CDC data shows. Among U.S.-born Asian Americans, tuberculosis cases rose more than 62% from 2021 to 2022. ""These communities are intertwined,"" Shete said. ""U.S.-born Asian communities are sometimes within the same household as non-U.S.-born Asian communities."" Homeless shelters or correctional facilities also bring a higher risk of infection, since residents live in close proximity. Tuberculosis was 11 times more common among people experiencing homelessness than among the general U.S. population as of 2016, according to an analysis published in 2021. From 2021 to 2022, there was a nearly 61% increase in tuberculosis cases among correctional facility residents. Chaisson said that could be due to reduced testing earlier in the pandemic. But the U.S. can reverse these trends, Davis said. ""It is realistic, actually, to eliminate TB in the United States in our lifetime,"" he said. ""That’s really what we should be working for."" "
"Loneliness poses health risks as deadly as smoking, surgeon general says",The Associated Press,"May 2, 2023, 3:41 PM UTC",U.S. news,"WASHINGTON  — Widespread loneliness in the U.S. poses health risks as deadly as smoking a dozen cigarettes daily, costing the health industry billions of dollars annually, the U.S. surgeon general said Tuesday in declaring the latest public health epidemic. About half of U.S. adults say they’ve experienced loneliness, Dr. Vivek Murthy said in an 81-page report from his office. “We now know that loneliness is a common feeling that many people experience. It’s like hunger or thirst. It’s a feeling the body sends us when something we need for survival is missing,” Murthy told The Associated Press in an interview. “Millions of people in America are struggling in the shadows, and that’s not right. That’s why I issued this advisory to pull back the curtain on a struggle that too many people are experiencing.” Research shows that Americans, who have become less engaged with worship houses, community organizations and even their own family members in recent decades, have steadily reported an increase in feelings of loneliness. The number of single households has also doubled over the last 60 years. But the crisis deeply worsened when Covid-19 spread, prompting schools and workplaces to shut their doors and sending millions of Americans to isolate at home away from relatives or friends. People culled their friend groups during the coronavirus pandemic and reduced time spent with those friends, the surgeon general’s report finds. Americans spent about 20 minutes a day in person with friends in 2020, down from 60 minutes daily nearly two decades earlier. The loneliness epidemic is hitting young people, ages 15 to 24, especially hard. The age group reported a 70% drop in time spent with friends during the same period. Loneliness increases the risk of premature death by nearly 30%, with the report revealing that those with poor social relationships also had a greater risk of stroke and heart disease. Isolation also elevates a person’s likelihood for experiencing depression, anxiety and dementia, according to the research. Murthy did not provide any data that illustrates how many people die directly from loneliness or isolation. The surgeon general is calling on workplaces, schools, technology companies, community organizations, parents and other people to make changes that will boost the country’s connectedness. He advises people to join community groups and put down their phones when they’re catching up with friends; employers to think carefully about their remote work policies; and health systems to provide training for doctors to recognize the health risks of loneliness. Technology has rapidly exacerbated the loneliness problem, with one study cited in the report finding that people who used social media for two hours or more daily were more than twice as likely to report feeling socially isolated than those who were on such apps for less than 30 minutes a day. Murthy said social media is driving the increase in loneliness in particular. His report suggests that technology companies roll out protections for children especially around their social media behavior. “There’s really no substitute for in-person interaction,” Murthy said. “As we shifted to use technology more and more for our communication, we lost out on a lot of that in-person interaction. How do we design technology that strengthens our relationships as opposed to weaken them?” "
Australia to ban recreational vaping in e-cigarette crackdown,Reuters,"May 2, 2023, 9:51 AM UTC",World,"Australia said on Tuesday it will ban recreational vaping and tighten other aspects of e-cigarette laws in the biggest crackdown on the tobacco industry in more than a decade to try to stop an alarming rise in teenage vaping. The government aims to ban all disposable vapes, which often comes in fruity flavors, ban the import of non-prescription vapes and limit nicotine levels, aiming for the sale of vapes to be confined to helping smokers quit. “Just like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavors to create a new generation of nicotine addicts,” Health Minister Mark Butler said in a speech at the National Press Club. Vaping, widely seen as a safer alternative to smoking cigarettes and useful for helping smokers quit, involves heating a liquid that contains nicotine in what is called an e-cigarette and turning it into a vapor that users inhale. But studies have shown the potential of long-term harm from the addictive e-cigarettes. Under the new rules, vapes will be sold only in pharmacies and require “pharmaceutical-type” packaging. Disposable vapes popular with young people will also be banned. Though a prescription is needed to buy nicotine vapes in Australia, lax border enforcement and a thriving illegal market mean they are readily available in convenience stores and other outlets. Major vape manufacturer Philip Morris welcomed the crackdown on such shops. “Nicotine vaping products sold in corner stores have always been illegal,” a spokesperson for the company said. “We have been urging enforcement against these illegal products for several years and hope this will now happen.” Butler said vaping had become a recreational product in Australia, mostly sold to teenagers and young people, who are three times as likely to take up smoking. Doctors backed the vaping crackdown but urged the government to do more to limit the number of young people taking it up. “Nicotine vaping products are being sold featuring colourful flavours and we have even seen products featuring the same type of imagery as children’s breakfast cereal including cartoon characters,” said Nicole Higgins, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. About 22% of Australians aged 18-24 have used an e-cigarette or vaping device at least once, data last year showed. The federal budget, due out next week, will include $155 million for measures to protect against the harm caused by tobacco and vaping. Australia has one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in the world. In 2012, it became the first country to force cigarette producers to abandon distinct, colorful branding and sell their products in uniformly drab packets. Tobacco firms were quick to switch to e-cigarettes that offer different flavors and created designs targeting a new generation of users. Butler said the government had no plan to follow neighboring New Zealand in banning cigarette sales for future generations but said the tax on tobacco would be raised by 5% a year over the next three years in a bid to curb sales. Some countries have tried to restrict vaping and some see it as a good way to get smokers to kick the habit. Britain said in April up to one million smokers would be encouraged to swap cigarettes for vapes, in what was a world first, offering financial incentives for pregnant women and providing e-cigarette starter kits to help.

Troubled teenage relationships can have lasting health consequences,Erika Edwards,"May 1, 2023, 4:00 AM UTC",Health news,"Teenagers engaged in toxic, controlling dating relationships may be at risk for a variety of problems as they enter adulthood, including drug use, as well as mental and physical health struggles, new research finds. The study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, also showed that such teens are likely to repeat patterns of unhealthy — potentially dangerous — intimate relationships. ""If an adolescent goes from one relationship to another, they are more likely to find themselves in the same situation in the future,"" said study author Antonio Piolanti, a post-doctoral researcher in the Institute of Psychology at the University of Klagenfurt in Austria. ""We have to try to break this cycle."" Piolanti and his colleagues reviewed 38 studies conducted between 2004 and 2022 that focused on the effects of a variety of teen dating violence, including sexual, physical, cyber and psychological abuse. Most of the studies were done in the United States, and followed teens for at least one year. Altogether, the studies found that young people — most often women — who had been in troublesome romantic relationships during their teen years were more likely to repeat those dating patterns, as well as starting drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes and marijuana. Teen dating violence ""was also significantly associated with increased sexual risk behaviors, such as unprotected sex or sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol,"" the study authors wrote. Several of the reviewed studies linked teen dating violence with symptoms of depression in young women for up to six years following the teenage relationship. The research adds to a worrisome body of evidence showing that girls in particular are at risk for intimate partner violence. A February report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2021, nearly 20% of teenage girls said they had been victims of violent sexual behavior. More than 1 in 10 said they had been raped. In the new study, the overall prevalence of physical violence was 20%, while psychological abuse was much more common, at up to 88%. That includes verbal and nonverbal controlling behavior. Psychological manipulation can be subtle, perhaps undetectable by the developing teenage brain, said Dr. Anisha Abraham, head of the Division of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine at Children's National in Washington, D.C. ""That might be really difficult for them to grasp, as they're just trying to feel good about their relationship,"" Abraham said. Abraham was not involved with the new research. The new findings do not mean that all teenagers in violent relationships will suffer lasting negative consequences. But ""adolescence is a really fundamentally important time where trajectories are set in terms of where young people are going and how they experience the rest of adulthood,"" said Dr. Richard Chung, an adolescent medicine specialist at Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina. ""Experiences, whether positive or negative, whether helpful or hurtful, during adolescence can have a lot of consequences,"" Chung, who was not involved with the new research, said. The research review did not include data on LGBTQ teens, though Abraham noted that gay, lesbian and bisexual teenagers ""certainly experience higher rates of physical and sexual dating violence compared to those people who are identified as heterosexual."" Talking with children as early as possible about healthy relationships is critical, experts agreed. ""There's a natural default assumption to believe that you don't have to have those conversations until your teen starts dating,"" said Chung. ""That's probably too late."" Abraham recommended modeling appropriate, respectful behavior among family members from the very beginning. ""It starts with the relationships that they see at home,"" she said. As kids get older, Abraham, who has two teenagers, recommends checking in regularly about what's happening in their friend groups, finding out whether dating has begun among their peers. ""That is something that I do,"" she said. ""It's really important to have conversations, not just with girls, but also with boys, in terms of what are normal healthy relationships."" That includes covering the topics of consent and respect. Dr. Rina Lazebnik, head of the Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, regularly asks her teen patients about their dating and even sex lives. ""It's a process. You have to talk to them in different ways based on their level of development,"" Lazebnik said. ""I don't use a computer while I talk to them because I find that it is very important for me to make eye contact. That lets them know that they have all my attention. Generally, they are open.""

Eating disorders among teens more severe than ever,Caroline Hopkins,"April 29, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",Health news,"Teen eating disorders have never been this rampant — or this severe. Hospitalizations for eating disorders spiked during the pandemic, doubling among adolescent girls, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most teens have returned to a normal life of in-person school, sports and social activities, eating disorders, especially anorexia, remain at an all-time high, experts warn. “The kids are not OK,” said Melissa Freizinger, the associate director of the eating disorder program at Boston Children’s Hospital. “As the pandemic started and then progressed, we kept thinking, ‘Oh, it’s going to get better in 2022. Oh, it’s going to get better in 2023. But it hasn’t.” Eating disorder-related health visits — which include hospital stays, pediatrician visits, telehealth talk therapy, and everything in between — more than doubled among people younger than 17 in the past five years, according to a recent report from the data company Trilliant Health. From 2018 through mid-2022, visits among this age group  jumped 107.4% across all eating disorders, from around 50,000 visits at the beginning of 2018 to more than 100,000 in 2022. Visits related to anorexia nervosa, which has the highest death rate of any mental illness, jumped 129.26%. "
Unexplained rise in life-threatening brain infections in children worries pediatricians,Aria Bendix,"April 28, 2023, 10:53 PM UTC",Health news,"After seeing an unusually high number of children with life-threatening brain infections last year, doctors are calling attention to the puzzling trend. In a presentation Thursday, researchers at the Southern Nevada Health District said there were 18 cases of pediatric brain abscesses — pus-filled pockets in the brain — in Clark County in 2022. By comparison, there was an average of five cases annually from 2015 to 2021. The findings were released at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s annual Epidemic Intelligence Service Conference and first reported by CNN. Dr. Taryn Bragg, an associate professor at the University of Utah who treated the Nevada cases, said that last spring, “every single call I was getting from the ER was a kid coming in with a brain abscess."" But cases in Nevada have declined considerably in recent months, she said. Bragg said she treated two patients for brain abscesses at the start of the year and hasn’t seen any since then. Brain abscesses are rare and generally form when fungi or bacteria enter brain tissue because of injury or infection. The body uses healthy tissue to form an abscess to stop the infection from spreading. If left untreated, the condition can cause permanent brain damage or death. The reasons for the recent spike in brain abscesses among children are unknown. When the CDC investigated the trend last year, its report identified a national increase in pediatric brain abscesses in summer 2021, followed by a peak in March 2022. However, the report also said the increase was “consistent with historical seasonal fluctuations observed since 2016” and showed that the rate of abscesses declined to baseline levels from March to May 2022. Bragg noted, however, that the CDC investigation ended as cases in Nevada were continuing to spike. Dr. Shaun Rodgers, a pediatric neurosurgeon at Cohen Children’s Medical Center — part of Northwell Health in New York — said his hospital is still seeing an above-average number of brain abscesses, a trend that started around the end of 2022. “It’s not just us. It’s hospitals all over the country,” Rodgers said. “When we’re talking to colleagues, it seems like everyone is feeling that we’ve definitely had an uptick in these types of infections.” He noted, though, that because brain abscesses are rare, this year’s total is still in the single digits at his hospital. Dr. Samir Shah, vice chair of clinical affairs and education at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, said brain abscesses occur in about one out of every eight million people, on average. But even so, he added, ""we always worry when we hear people say, ‘Hey, we’re seeing a little bit more of this.’ All of a sudden we’re on high guard because, if there is something going on, we absolutely want to know."" Shah, who co-authored the national CDC report, suggested that the trend could partly be due to the surge of respiratory viruses and bacterial infections — including group A strep — over the winter. Many experts think a lack of exposure to viruses and bacteria during the pandemic weakened people's ability to fight them off. “As soon as we started to undo some of these [pandemic restrictions], you started to see the viruses come back, you saw more sinus infections, and then, not surprisingly, you ended up seeing more brain abscesses,” Shah said. Respiratory viruses can lead to sinus infections, which can predispose kids to brain abscesses, Rodgers explained. ""It seems like we're having an uptick in sinus infections that have sort of gone undiagnosed for a while, and then they can actually go through the bone and get into the brain,"" he said. Other researchers haven't ruled out the possibility that Covid itself may play a role. Another CDC report identified a roughly 100% increase in brain abscesses, on average, across eight pediatric hospitals during the first two years of the pandemic. One hospital in particular — Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan — saw a 236% increase in bacterial brain infections during that time. “We were wondering if the virus itself was causing some sort of inflammatory process that was allowing these bacteria to invade,"" said Dr. Rosemary Olivero, the hospital’s division chief of medical subspecialties. ""That has not been a question that we’ve been able to answer yet.” But Olivero said brain abscesses at her hospital are now back to baseline levels — she estimated that the hospital has seen less than five cases so far this year. Shah said Cincinnati Children’s has only seen a couple cases of brain abscesses this year. In general, he added, the symptoms to look out for include fever, headache and vomiting. Children experiencing the condition may also have seizures or stroke-like symptoms such as impaired motor skills or slurred speech. Doctors treat the abscesses with antibiotics, and multiple surgeries are often required. Shah said a one- to two-week stay in the hospital is fairly typical, followed by two to four weeks of additional IV antibiotics at home. Although doctors can voluntarily report brain abscess cases to public health departments, they are not required to do so. That makes the national picture unclear, so several doctors are calling for more surveillance. ""It would not surprise me, if you looked all across the country, that you started seeing more of these"" cases, Shah said. "
Shortage of penicillin limits access to the go-to drug for syphilis,Aria Bendix,"April 27, 2023, 11:14 PM UTC",Health news,"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday reported a shortage of an injectable form of penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat syphilis and other bacterial infections like strep throat. The drug joins a growing list of medications facing supply shortages in the U.S. Liquid amoxicillin, another antibiotic used to treat strep, has been in short supply since October, according to the FDA. The form of penicillin affected, called penicillin G benzathine, is the preferred drug for syphilis, because it can be used in adults, children and pregnant people. It's often administered in outpatient clinics or urgent care settings. Dosages for both children and adults are in short supply, according to the FDA. ""The nice part about penicillin G benzathine is that you can give it to a pregnant mother and if she has syphilis, it will also treat the baby,"" said Dr. Jeremy Cauwels, the chief physician at Sanford Health, a medical system in Minnesota and North and South Dakota. He said pharmacists in his network have been dealing with a limited supply of penicillin since the winter. Syphilis cases in the U.S. reached a 70-year high in 2021, the last year for which data is available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sexually transmitted infection can result in organ damage or death if left untreated. The FDA attributed the penicillin shortage to increased demand. Pfizer, the sole supplier of that form of penicillin in the U.S., pointed to the amoxicillin shortage as the main issue, because it prompted doctors to recommend penicillin instead. The rise in syphilis cases most likely further accelerated demand, the company said. The amoxicillin shortage arose during a surge of respiratory virus infections over the fall and winter, when the antibiotic was prescribed for secondary bacterial infections resulting from Covid, flu or respiratory syncytial virus. Amoxicillin has also been used to treat a rise in severe strep cases dating to the fall. In November, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended penicillin G benzathine as an alternative to amoxicillin for strep throat patients. Strep throat case numbers remain elevated. The CDC said last week that unpublished data from its national surveillance program showed a five-year high in emergency department visits for regular strep infections in February and March. Pfizer said it has been delivering more of its injectable penicillin to the market than ever before but still can’t keep up with demand. The FDA said on its website that supply issues are expected to resolve sometime from October to December. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists has reported an additional shortage of another form of penicillin, penicillin G procaine, which doesn't last as long in the body or cross the placental barrier. But Michael Ganio, the society's senior director of pharmacy practice and quality, said ""benzathine is probably a little bit more of a challenging shortage, because it is the drug of choice."" Overall, the Covid pandemic seems to have worsened drug supply issues, Cauwels said. New medication shortages increased by nearly 30% from 2021 to 2022, according to a March report from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The reasons, it said, include a surge in demand for certain drugs, overreliance on foreign suppliers and manufacturers’ moving overseas. The U.S. is seven months into a shortage of Adderall, a medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Four cancer drugs, including two common forms of chemotherapy, are under shortage as well, according to the FDA. Injectable medications are more than twice as likely to experience shortages compared to other forms, such as oral or topical drugs, the Senate committee report said. Cauwels said his health system doesn't expect to get additional penicillin supply until the fall, although it is likely to have enough until then. Its amoxicillin supply is also limited, he added, but it’s getting a steady allocation based on what it has used in previous years. He added that although there are alternatives to Pfizer's penicillin drug for treating syphilis, other antibiotics come with more side effects. The injectable penicillin became the go-to, he said, because ""we know it always works and we know it’s easy to administer."" "
"Mediterranean diet may protect against diabetes more than realized, study finds",Linda Carroll,"April 27, 2023, 11:01 PM UTC",Diabetes,"The Mediterranean diet has already been shown to help protect the aging brain and may significantly lower risk of heart disease. A new study has now found a much stronger link than previously realized between the Mediterranean diet — which is filled with whole grains, fish, fruits and olive oil — and a reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes. Previous research looking at the impact of a Mediterranean diet on diabetes have shown mixed results, possibly because the studies were based on participants remembering and self-reporting the type of food they ate. For the new research, published Thursday in PLOS Medicine, British scientists used blood samples to develop a biomarker scoring system. They first ran a small trial, called the Medley trial, with 128 adults ages 65 and older who were randomized to consume either the Mediterranean diet or continue eating as they usually did for a period of six months. A comparison of blood samples from the two groups turned up a host of biomarkers of fatty acids and carotenoids, the substances that give color to vegetables such as pumpkins, carrots and tomatoes. For the second part of the research, scientists from the University of Cambridge, in the U.K., analyzed data — including blood samples and self-reported diet information — from more than 340,000 middle-aged participants in a long-running European study. Over about 10 years, 9,453 had developed Type 2 diabetes. Then the researchers compared biomarker scores from the 9,453 to 12,749 randomly selected participants without diabetes in the large study. They found a nearly 30% reduction in diabetes risk using the biomarker data, compared to 10% reduction from the self-reported data. That means previous studies probably underestimated the impact of the Mediterranean diet. The findings strengthen the case for recommending the Mediterranean diet for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes, said senior author Dr. Nita Forouhi, a professor of population health and nutrition and program leader in nutritional epidemiology at the University of Cambridge. “The 20% of participants with the highest values of the biomarker score had a 62% lower risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes relative to the 20% with the lowest biomarker score values,” Forouhi said in an email. For someone consuming an average of 2,000 calories per day, researchers defined it as, at least: And a daily maximum of: Weekly recommendations included: And a maximum of: Dr. Peter Goulden, chief of the division of endocrinology, diabetes and bone diseases at Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West, called the new biomarker scoring an exciting development. “If you compare the biomarker score with self-reports, the effect is three times larger,” said Goulden, who is also an associate professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “So that’s very powerful.” Further studies will be needed to corroborate the findings and determine if they would apply to a wider population, he said. A downside is the biomarkers don't determine whether the benefits are from fruit and vegetable consumption or some other aspect of the diet, said Linda Van Horn, a clinical nutrition epidemiologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University in Chicago. Still, this approach “is more objective, so I would say it’s a step in the right direction,” she said. The importance of the findings is underscored by the rising rates of diabetes around the world, said Dr. Anna Beth Bradley, an assistant professor of medicine, diabetes, endocrinology and metabolism at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “If you look at the prevalence of diabetes globally, you see that in Europe, the incidence is around 6% to 7%, while in the U.S., it’s around 11%, which suggests that the standard American diet probably has contributed to the rise in diabetes,” Bradley said. “That terrible American diet is leaking over to other countries with diabetes rising in pretty much every country.” "
Map of gun deaths across the U.S. shows cities have lower rates than rural counties,Aria Bendix,"April 26, 2023, 10:54 PM UTC / Updated April 27, 2023, 5:15 PM UTC",Health news,"Gun death rates are consistently higher in rural areas than in big cities, two decades of data show. From 2011 to 2020, the most rural counties in the U.S. had a 37% higher rate of gun deaths per capita than the most urban counties, according to research published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Surgery. That's up from a 25% difference from 2000 to 2010. The findings are based on an analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors attributed the trend to a rise in gun suicides, which outnumbered gun homicides in 2021 by more than 5,300 and are more likely to occur in rural counties. ""Rural areas are sort of ignored when we pass firearm laws, because people think that it’s just a city problem, while it’s not,"" said Paul Reeping, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Davis' Violence Prevention Research Program, who conducted the research as a doctoral student at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. ""Suicides were always the highest in rural areas. That hasn’t changed,"" Reeping said. ""It's just that the gun deaths overall have gone up, including firearm suicides, in those areas."" From 2011 to 2020, the most rural counties had a 46% lower rate of gun homicide deaths than the most urban counties but a 76% higher rate of gun suicide deaths, according to Reeping’s analysis. The map below, which uses a different CDC dataset from the set the report used, shows where gun deaths were concentrated from 2011 to 2020. Counties in darker blue had higher rates of firearm deaths per 100,000 people. "
"FDA approves first pill for fecal transplants, made from healthy bacteria in human waste",The Associated Press,"April 27, 2023, 3:04 PM UTC",Health news,"U.S. health officials on Wednesday approved the first pill made from healthy bacteria found in human waste to fight dangerous gut infections — an easier way of performing so-called fecal transplants. The new treatment from Seres Therapeutics provides a simpler, rigorously tested version of stool-based procedures that some medical specialists have used for more than a decade to help patients. The Food and Drug Administration cleared the capsules for adults 18 and older who face risks from repeat infections with Clostridium difficile, a bacteria that can cause severe nausea, cramping and diarrhea. C. diff is particularly dangerous when it reoccurs, leading to between 15,000 and 30,000 deaths per year. It can be killed with antibiotics but they also destroy good bacteria that live in the gut, leaving it more susceptible to future infections. The new capsules are approved for patients who have already received antibiotic treatment. More than 10 years ago, some doctors began reporting success with fecal transplants — using stool from a healthy donor — to restore the gut’s healthy balance and prevent reinfections. The FDA approved the first pharmaceutical-grade version of the treatment last year from a rival drugmaker, Ferring Pharmaceuticals. But that company’s product — like most of the original procedures — must be delivered via the rectum. Cambridge, Mass.-based Seres will market its drug as a less invasive option. The treatment will be sold under the brand name Vowst and comes as a regimen of four daily capsules taken for three consecutive days. Both of the recent FDA approvals are the product of years of pharmaceutical industry research into the microbiome, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in the gut. Currently most fecal transplants are provided by a network of stool banks that have popped up at medical institutions and hospitals across the country. While the availability of new FDA-approved options is expected to decrease demand for donations from stool banks, some plan to stay open. OpenBiome, the largest stool bank in the U.S., said it will keep serving patients who aren’t eligible for the FDA-approved products, such as children and adults with treatment-resistant cases. It has supplied more than 65,000 stool samples for C. diff patients since 2013. “OpenBiome is committed to maintaining safe access to ‘fecal transplantation’ for these patients as a vital last line of defense,” said Dr. Majdi Osman, the group’s medical chief. OpenBiome’s standard stool treatment costs less than $1,700 and is typically delivered as a frozen solution within days of ordering. Seres did not disclose the price it will charge for its capsules in a statement Wednesday evening. “We want to make the commercial experience for physicians and patients as easy as possible,” said Eric Shaff, the company’s chief executive officer, in an interview ahead of the announcement. “Ease of administration — in our view — is one of the aspects of the value we’re delivering.” Seres will co-market the treatment with Swiss food giant Nestle, which will also split the profits. Seres will receive a $125 million milestone payment from Nestle in connection with the FDA approval. Overseeing the fledgling industry of U.S. stool banks has created regulatory headaches for the FDA, which doesn’t traditionally police homemade products and procedures used in doctor’s offices. In the early days of the trend, the FDA warned consumers about the risks of potential infections from the fecal transplants, as some people sought out questionable “do it yourself” methods from videos and websites. Seres executives say their manufacturing process relies on the same techniques and equipment used to purify blood products and other biologic therapies. The company starts with stool provided by a small group of donors who are screened for various health risks and conditions. Their stool is likewise tested for dozens of potential viruses, infections and parasites. The company then processes the samples to remove the waste, isolate the healthy bacteria and kill any other lingering organisms. Thousands of capsules can be made from each stool sample, making it a more efficient process than current fecal transplants, according to the company. The FDA warned in its approval announcement that the drug “may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents. It is also possible for Vowst to contain food allergens,” the agency noted. The FDA approved the treatment based on a 180-patient study in which nearly 88% of patients taking the capsules did not experience reinfection after 8 weeks, compared with 60% of those who received dummy pills. Common side effects included abdominal swelling, constipation and diarrhea. "
"People with diabetes lost up to 34 pounds taking Eli Lilly drug, company says",Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"April 27, 2023, 10:15 AM UTC",Health news,"An Eli Lilly drug helped obese patients with Type 2 diabetes lose 15% of their body weight, or about 34 pounds, on average, in a late-stage clinical trial, the drugmaker said in a news release Thursday. The results add to evidence that the drug, tirzepatide — which is sold under the brand name Mounjaro for Type 2 diabetes — can be used as an effective weight loss aid. Results from another trial released last year found that tirzepatide helped patients without Type 2 diabetes lose 22.5% of their body weight on average, or about 52 pounds. Patients in that trial had obesity or were overweight. Weight loss can be more difficult for people with diabetes. That’s because of the way their body responds to insulin, said Dr. Shauna Levy, a specialist in obesity medicine and the medical director of the Tulane Bariatric Center in New Orleans. She was not involved in the trial. “The more progressed the diabetes, the worse the insulin resistance and the harder it is to lose weight,” Levy said, adding that the medication could be “extremely helpful” for people with Type 2 diabetes who need help losing weight. The trial results released Thursday looked at 938 adults with obesity or overweight and Type 2 diabetes. Study participants had an average body weight of 222 pounds. The participants in the trial received a weekly injection of tirzepatide or a placebo for 72 weeks. Two doses of tirzepatide were studied: a 10-milligram dose and a 15 mg dose. Participants who got the 10 mg dose lost, on average, 13.4% of their body weight, or 29.8 pounds, while people who got the 15 mg dose lost, on average, 15.7% of their body weight, or 34.4 pounds, according to the company. In comparison, people who got the placebo lost 3.3% of their body weight, or 7 pounds. The drug was well tolerated, and side effects were similar to those in the trial with people without diabetes. Side effects in that trial included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation. Thursday’s results were announced in a news release and haven’t been made available for peer review yet. Losing weight can be effective for the prevention and treatment of Type 2 diabetes, said Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina. “If we want to reduce the morbidity and mortality of diabetes, we need to treat one of its underlying risk factors: obesity,” Spratt said. The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing tirzepatide over whether it can be used as a weight loss aid in people with obesity or who are overweight. It’s among a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, which mimic a hormone that helps reduce food intake and appetite. The drugs were initially developed for Type 2 diabetes but were later found to induce weight loss. Two other GLP-1 agonists, Ozempic and Wegovy, from Novo Nordisk, are in high demand in the U.S. because of their weight loss effects. Tirzepatide also imitates a second hormone, called GIP, which along with reducing appetite may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat. Mike Mason, the head of Eli Lilly’s diabetes and obesity division, told NBC News that Thursday’s results will complete the company’s submission package to the FDA. The company expects the agency could reach a decision as early as late 2023. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
Popular diets help you lose weight but may not be so good for heart health,Linda Carroll,"April 27, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Heart Health,"Some of the most popular diet plans may help with weight loss, which can lower the risk of heart disease. But an eating plan that includes a lot of unhealthy oils and saturated fats can raise the risk of heart disease, even if it does help reduce weight. That's why a committee of experts with the American Heart Association developed a ranking of the top 10 diets in the U.S., scoring them based on how well they followed guidelines for a healthy heart. It’s the first time the heart association has rated the most popular diets. The list, published Thursday in Circulation, gave the lowest scores to the paleo and ketogenic, or keto, diets for their reliance on fats from animal sources, such as butter and full-fat dairy, while severely restricting carbohydrates. Top marks were given to the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, which focuses on whole grains, vegetables and low-fat dairy. Pescetarian — eating fish but not red meat —and vegetarian diets also scored highly for their heart benefits. It's not that eating fat in general is bad for the heart, said the chair of the committee, Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Unsaturated fats — such as plant-based oils, like olive oil or sunflower oil, or fish, like salmon, and walnuts — can reduce LDL cholesterol levels and lower the risk of heart disease. Gardner and other committee members rated diets according to how well they followed the American Heart Association's scientific guidelines for a healthy heart: In the new report, the committee divided the diets into four tiers, based on a point given for each guideline. The highest-scoring diets included: Vegan and low-fat diets were ranked in the second tier. Both encourage consuming legumes and nuts while limiting alcohol and foods and beverages with added sugars. However, following a strict vegan diet could contribute to vitamin B-12 deficiency, according to the heart experts. Low-fat diets lost points for treating all fats the same and because people tended to replace fats with carbohydrates or added sugars. The third tier included very low-carb and very low-fat diets for being too low in fiber or for restricting fruits, nuts and healthy fats, such as plant oils. The keto and paleo diets also fell into the fourth tier, in part because of restrictions on fruits, whole grains and legumes, which can result in reduced fiber intake, Gardner said. Dr. Deepak Bhatt, the director of Mount Sinai Heart and a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said, “The recommendations not only align with science, but also probably with what our mothers told us growing up: Eat your fruits and vegetables.” The top-scoring diets also emphasize whole grains, which “not only reduce cardiovascular risk but also cancer risk and other ailments, like diabetes,” said Bhatt, who was not associated with the new report. Brooke Aggarwal, an assistant professor of medical sciences in the cardiology division at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said the American Heart Association “has done a great job of taking popular diets and categorizing them according to how well they align with AHA guidelines.” “Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, so we should all be concerned with how to prevent it,” Aggarwal said. For people drawn to the keto and paleo diets, eating more unsaturated fats could help. “If red meat is preferred, then it should be lean,"" she said. The key to lowering heart disease risk is increasing fruits and vegetables, choosing healthy sources of protein and minimizing processed foods. “Ultimately, it comes down to what a person can adhere to and fit into their lifestyle,” Aggarwal said. “Managing weight is important.” "
"What to know about XBB.1.16, the 'Arcturus' variant","Akshay Syal, M.D.","April 26, 2023, 10:00 PM UTC",Coronavirus,"A new Covid variant is spreading in the U.S., but will it cause a surge in cases? XBB.1.16 — dubbed “Arcturus” on social media — is another descendant of omicron. It was first detected in early January and the majority of cases have been seen in India so far. It’s been steadily rising in the U.S. in recent weeks, although it still made up slightly less than 10% of new confirmed Covid cases as of Saturday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last week, the World Health Organization deemed XBB.1.16 a “variant of interest” as it continues to spread and outcompete other variants. Ali Mokdad, a professor of global health at the University of Washington, said it’s still too early to predict what XBB.1.16 will do. But what he’s seen so far has been reassuring. “We haven’t seen an increase in hospitalizations, we haven’t seen an increase in any of the indicators that make us worry,” Mokdad said. Mokdad said that XBB.1.16 is gaining ground on the previously dominant strain in the U.S., called XBB.1.5. That increased transmissibility appears to be due to the subvariant’s ability to avoid immune detection in the body. “It can’t be spreading so fast unless it has some immune escape,” Mokdad said. The virus has two ways of surviving, Mokdad said. One way is to be more infectious and evade immunity from previous infections or vaccinations, “which this one is doing,” he said. The other one is to become really deadly. “We haven’t seen that yet.” Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of infectious disease at the University of California, San Francisco, said that aside from the increase in transmissibility, so far XBB.1.16 is not too different from XBB.1.5. That means that “hopefully, it’s not going to be too different” in terms of how sick it makes people and how well the vaccines work. XBB.1.16 doesn’t appear to be making people sicker than earlier omicron strains, according to Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program. “To my knowledge, we’re not seeing a different spectrum of symptoms or severity associated with this variant of interest,” Ryan said during a media briefing last week. Some news reports have mentioned that XBB.1.16 infection causes a “new” symptom — conjunctivitis, or pink eye — though the WHO noted that this symptom was already known to be associated with Covid. As early as the spring of 2020 there were reports of itchy, sore eyes in Covid patients. In May 2020, the American Academy of Ophthalmologists noted that mild conjunctivitis could be a symptom of Covid. ""It's not a new symptom,"" but it may be more common than previously thought, Chin-Hong said. Mokdad said that labs haven’t yet determined how well the Covid vaccines work against XBB.1.16. Chin-Hong said he wasn't particularly concerned about the vaccines. ""Because it's so similar to XBB.1.5, we think that vaccines will be fine,"" he said. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC said that older adults and immunocompromised individuals could get a second dose of the updated booster shot, which protects against an earlier omicron subvariant. XBB.1.16 certainly won’t be the last new variant that emerges. The subvariant is yet another offshoot of the growing omicron family tree. XBB.1.16 is a descendant of the XBB subvariant, which itself formed when two strains of omicron subvariant BA.2 combined, according to the WHO. Already, two other XBB strains, XBB.1.9.1 and XBB.1.9.2 are also rising in the U.S. Together, the two strains account for about 11% of new cases, according to the CDC. On Wednesday, the WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, said the XBB.1.9 strains are likely similar to what’s been seen with previous XBBs. “This just indicates to us that the virus continues to evolve and it will continue to evolve because the virus is circulating pretty much unchecked,” Van Kerkhove said.

Amphetamines are often prescribed along with depression and anxiety medications,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"April 26, 2023, 7:34 PM UTC",Health news,"A large number of U.S. adults are being prescribed drugs like amphetamines, which have a risk for misuse, along with medications for depression and anxiety, a new study has found. The practice, the authors say, could lead to higher rates of misuse and addiction and cause unknown side effects. The Drug Enforcement Administration classifies amphetamines and methylphenidate as Schedule II controlled substances, the same designation given to cocaine, OxyContin and fentanyl. Those drugs, which stimulate the body’s nervous system, are prescribed for a variety of conditions, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders and nasal congestion, but are sometimes prescribed off-label to help treat disorders like depression and anxiety in combination with other medications. “Off-label” prescribing refers to medications prescribed for uses other than what they were approved for. “We are concerned given the risks of these drugs,” said the study’s lead author, Thomas Moore, a researcher at the Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness at Johns Hopkins University, noting that prescription stimulants are “highly potent” and that data on using them in combination with other psychiatric medications is limited. The research was published Monday in BMJ Open. “These drugs have a high potential for physical and psychological dependence,” he said. The use of prescription stimulants in combination with other medications appears to be rising, he said, although the study did not compare use to previous years. The study’s findings were based on insurance claims data from more than 9.1 million adults with private health insurance from Oct. 1, 2019, to Dec. 21, 2020. Prescription stimulant use was defined as adults’ filling one or more stimulant prescriptions that contained amphetamines and methylphenidate, the active ingredient in Ritalin. Researchers found that more than 276,000 adults were using Schedule II prescription stimulants. Among them, just under half — around 45% — were using the drugs alongside other psychiatric medications, including antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs and opioids. Some physicians may prescribe stimulants to treat the side effects of other psychiatric medications or to enhance them. That is sometimes called a “prescribing cascade,"" Moore said. “An antidepressant is prescribed for a patient and maybe one of the side effects is sedation, and so they add a stimulant, like amphetamines,” he said. “Or maybe the drug has fairly modest effects, and so they add an amphetamine, and they’ll get a little more kick out of it.” It's common for conditions like depression to aggravate another mental disorder someone might have, said Dr. Robert Bassett, the associate medical director of the Poison Control Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. If one ""has worsening or untreated depression, the depressive symptoms can make the ability to focus harder, leading to worsening symptoms of ADHD,"" he said. More females, at 52.6%, used both stimulants and other psychiatric medications compared to males, at 36.2%, according to the study. In addition, young people — particularly those ages 19 to 34 — were more likely than older people to take combinations of medications. Amphetamine products accounted for 86.4% of the stimulant prescriptions, while methylphenidate products accounted for 13.6% of prescriptions. Dr. Scott Hadland, an addiction specialist at Mass General for Children in Boston who was not involved in the study, stressed “caution” when interpreting the study’s findings. The study examined how common it is for people to receive prescription stimulants in addition to other psychiatric medications, but it did not examine whether people misused or were dependent on those medications, he said. He also noted that prescription rates for stimulants like Adderall are rising in the U.S. in general, so it is more likely that someone would be taking one or more medications at the same time. A study published in 2021 found a 79% increase in prescription stimulant use among adults from 2013 to 2018. “It’s not uncommon for people with ADHD to have another condition like depression,” he said. Moore said he is concerned about the practice because stimulants alongside medications for conditions like depression and anxiety have not been thoroughly tested in clinical trials. When such prescriptions are used together, people could misuse them or experience unpleasant side effects. “We have very little scientific information about whether this practice is safe and effective,” Moore said. He said that although the study relies on commercial health insurance data, it may not represent the uninsured or people on government health programs, like Medicare and Medicaid. Doctors should prescribe the lowest effective dose possible, Bassett said. Hadland, of Mass General for Children, said doctors should make sure they are prescribing stimulants “appropriately” and are aware of all other medications patients may be receiving.

"Promising new malaria vaccine has been approved in two countries, with others likely to follow",Aria Bendix,"April 26, 2023, 5:41 PM UTC",Health news,"Ghana and Nigeria both approved a new malaria vaccine this month — an important step in the fight against a disease that kills more than 600,000 people annually. At least 10 other African countries are reviewing trial data for the shot, according to the World Health Organization, so more approvals are expected in the coming weeks. The vaccine, developed by researchers at Oxford University, is the second to become publicly available. The first, a shot called Mosquirix from drugmaker GSK, has been administered through a pilot program in Kenya, Ghana and Malawi since 2019 but is still in limited supply. The new vaccine is the first malaria shot to be approved in Nigeria, whose deaths from the disease make up 31% of the worldwide total. ""It’s good news,"" said Dyann Wirth, an infectious diseases professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, adding, ""These vaccines can save lives and save hospitalizations, reduce the impact of the disease in the most vulnerable young children."" An estimated 619,000 people died of malaria in 2021, the latest annual total available, and 96% of those deaths occurred in Africa, according to the WHO. The disease is caused by a parasite that spreads to humans through mosquito bites. Scientists have been researching possible malaria vaccines since the 1960s; Mosquirix took more than 30 years to develop and test. To prevent infection, countries with high rates of malaria mostly rely on mosquito nets, insecticides or antimalarial drugs for children. The Oxford vaccine consists of three doses administered every four weeks, followed by a fourth dose a year later. So far, the only peer-reviewed data on it comes from a small trial of 450 infants up to 17 months old in Burkina Faso. Among that group, the shot was found to reduce the risk of malaria by 77%. Adrian Hill, the vaccine’s lead developer and co-director of the Oxford Martin Program on Vaccines, said a Phase 3 trial of 4,800 children up to 3 years old showed similar safety and efficacy. But those findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The WHO is still evaluating data on the Oxford vaccine and has not yet recommended it for use. Countries without their own regulatory processes for approving vaccines often defer to the WHO’s recommendations, Wirth said, so they may still wait for that. The WHO said it does not have a specific timeline for its decision. ""Sadly, we’re not seeing the urgency that WHO and every other regulator in the planet showed with Covid,"" Hill said, ""which is disappointing, given that there are huge numbers of deaths from malaria in young children in Africa."" The WHO's recommendation of Mosquirix in 2021 represented a major milestone, but manufacturing challenges have led to a slow rollout. In 2015, GSK closed the Belgium plant where the vaccine was produced, and it did not reopen until 2019. Last year was the first in which the plant continuously manufactured the vaccine’s antigen — the component that stimulates an immune response. GSK has asked a company in India, Bharat Biotech, to produce the antigen instead, but that won't happen until 2028. To date, 1.5 million children have received the Mosquirix shot, according to the WHO. In addition to the three countries already administering it, 11 others have applied to receive doses, the WHO said. ""The demand for this vaccine has been unprecedented, with 29 countries already coming forward to Gavi saying that they would like to introduce this vaccine already,"" Dr. Mary Hamel, the WHO's team lead for malaria vaccines, said on a media call Wednesday. (Gavi is an international vaccine alliance that partners with the WHO, governments and nonprofit groups.) ""Demand far outstrips the supply that’s currently available,"" Hamel added. GSK said it expects to have around 4 million doses available later this year, and a total of 18 million by the end of 2025. But the WHO estimates that 80 to 100 million annual vaccine doses are required to immunize children at risk of malaria. The Oxford vaccine could help alleviate the shortage. The Serum Institute of India has already committed to produce 20 million doses in the next two months. (The company is manufacturing the doses “at risk,” meaning it hasn’t made a deal with a buyer yet.) The Oxford shot is also cheaper, at $3 per dose relative to around $10 for the GSK shot. Like the Oxford vaccine, Mosquirix consists of four doses. The first three are administered monthly, starting when an infant is 5 months old, followed by the fourth once they reach 15 to 18 months. In a large-scale trial, three doses of the vaccine reduced the risk of malaria in children by 28% after four years, while four doses had a slightly higher efficacy of 36%. Hill said the Oxford vaccine's efficacy also wanes over time but was ""still very high"" after at least 3 1/2 years. It's possible, though, that the Oxford shot will prove less effective outside of a trial setting, Wirth said, since the study in Burkina Faso largely administered vaccines before the seasonal peak in malaria transmission, which comes in July. “I expect that, when released at large scale, it will have a similar efficacy to the existing recommended vaccine,” she said. Neither vaccine will eliminate the need for additional measures to keep malaria from spreading, Wirth added. “Is it a magic bullet? Will the vaccine alleviate the need for bed nets or insecticide spraying? No, definitely not,” she said. “The vaccine will also not replace the need for drugs, but it can be added to the existing tools to have greater impact.” "
"Adults are getting allergies for the first time. Thanks, climate change.",Erika Edwards,"April 25, 2023, 8:11 PM UTC / Updated April 26, 2023, 12:39 AM UTC",Health news,"For several years now, we are living in a world where every sneeze, each hint of a scratchy throat or stuffy nose, gives a person pause. Is it Covid? Just a cold? For a growing number of adults in their 30s, 40s and 50s, those symptoms are turning out to be hallmarks of something they've never had to deal with before: seasonal allergies. ""What I see is people coming in for the first time, especially over the last five, seven years or so,"" said Dr. Clifford Bassett, an allergist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. ""They will always say, 'I don't understand how this is happening to me.'"" Dr. Michele Pham, an allergist and immunologist at UCSF Health in San Francisco, has noticed the same trend. ""We've had patients coming to us saying, 'This hasn't been an issue in the past,'"" said Pham. ""Now they're getting symptoms, or their allergy symptoms have significantly worsened."" It's not clear how many people are feeling pollen pain for the first time, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported recently that about a quarter of adults in the United States had a seasonal allergy in 2021, the first time the CDC tracked data on seasonal allergies for adults. A large driver of adult-onset seasonal allergies appears to be climate change. ""The pollen season right now is about three weeks longer than it was 30 years ago, and there's about 20% more pollen in the air,"" said Dr. Neelu Tummala, an ear, nose and throat specialist and co-director of the Climate Health Institute at George Washington University. Those statistics come from research published in 2021. As the Earth's core temperature increases, Tummala explained, the ground thaws earlier in the year, rousing trees from their winter slumber, prompting them to flower and produce pollen earlier than ever. It's not just that the season is lasting longer. The sheer amount of pollen in the air has exploded. The combustion of fossil fuels — another cause of global warming —increases carbon dioxide. As CO2 levels go up, plants and trees produce more pollen. Dr. Stanley Fineman, an allergist at Atlanta Allergy and Asthma and a spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, calls the phenomenon a ""pollen storm."" ""The pollen counts, particularly this season, have been much, much higher than they’ve been in the past,"" he said. Symptoms are starting earlier in the year and are more severe. The increase in symptomatic allergies translates into more money spent on treatments, visits to the doctor and impacts on quality of life. ""It's not just like pollen allergy seasons are annoying,"" Tummala said. ""They also also impact cognitive function. They impact sleep quality."" Many people are likely genetically predisposed to allergies, but were never bothered by them before, experts say. Now that the pollen counts have grown, ""I think it affects them more, because their system is overloaded,"" Fineman said. Kiara Wilson, a 32-year-old teacher in Brooklyn, New York, said that all she experienced the past few spring seasons was a slightly itchy throat. This allergy season, however, has been much different. ""I couldn't stop sneezing. Like, I had to sneeze between 50 to 75 times,"" Wilson said. ""I actually had to buy an allergy medicine for the first time."" While many symptoms of allergies, such as congestion and coughing, can overlap with respiratory viruses, one symptom is a telltale sign of an allergic reaction: itching. ""The biggest symptom I would suggest is the itchiness of the eyes, nose and throat,"" Bassett said. ""You don’t get itchiness if you have a cold or if you're having a sinus infection."" Symptoms aren't always clear, however, and can overlap with other respiratory illnesses. ""We've definitely had patients come to our clinic who thought they were having allergies, but they had Covid instead,"" Pham said. The vast array of allergy medications in pharmacies can be overwhelming. Topical therapies, either prescription or over-the-counter, that target the itch sensation tend to be most effective, UCSF Health's Pham said. Those include nasal sprays, eyedrops and skin creams. Not only are people seeking pollen relief for the first time; the lengthening allergy season and the growing amount of pollen in the air have prompted doctors to shift treatment guidance. Tummala, of George Washington University, said some patients are needing to use allergy medications more often, in higher doses, or in combination with other strategies. ""Before you could get away with just using an intranasal steroid, and now you have to do a neti pot rinse and then the steroid,"" she said. Pollen counts tend to be lower in the mornings. ""If you need to do outdoor activities, that's the time to do it,"" Fineman said. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
"Supply of cancer drug Pluvicto should increase in second half of the year, company says",Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"April 25, 2023, 6:34 PM UTC",Cancer,"Supply of the cancer drug Pluvicto should increase “meaningfully” in the second half of the year, the drug’s manufacturer Novartis said Tuesday amid widespread shortages. Pluvicto, a drug for advanced prostate cancer, started having supply problems in February as demand increased. The Food and Drug Administration listed it as being in short supply in early March. The Swiss drugmaker said in February that it had temporarily stopped accepting new orders, leaving some prostate cancer patients out of treatment options. The drug is made in small batches and must be given to patients within five days, making it nearly impossible to stockpile. During a Tuesday call with investors, executives at Novartis said the drug should be more widely available around late summer to early fall as the company ramps up production at a new facility. On Friday, the company announced that a manufacturing facility in Millburn, New Jersey, had received FDA approval to begin making the drug for commercial use in the U.S. Production will begin “in the coming weeks” and ramp up gradually, according to the company. Novartis is also planning to ask the FDA to allow Pluvicto to be made at another manufacturing site in Indianapolis, which could also help with supply, according to slides shared by the company on the earnings call. That site could open by the end of the year, according to the company. The drug is made for use in the U.S. at a site in Ivrea, Italy. ""Taken together, those three sites obviously have a lot of production capacity for Pluvicto,"" Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said on the call. Pluvicto is among a handful of cancer drugs in short supply in the U.S. BCG, a drug for bladder cancer; and methotrexate and cisplatin, two common chemotherapy drugs, are also in shortage, according to the FDA. A fifth drug, fluorouracil, is also in short supply, according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, a group that tracks nationwide drug shortages. Novartis estimates it could produce at least 250,000 doses of Pluvicto annually by 2024, according to slides shared by the company. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "

Bill to combat youth fentanyl crisis to be introduced after multiple teens overdose in a Texas school district,Daniella Silva,"April 24, 2023, 9:46 PM UTC",News,"CARROLLTON, Texas — Ryan Vaughn's daughter, Sienna, was just 16 years old when she died of an overdose after unknowingly ingesting fentanyl. The cheerleader and high school junior had just finished enjoying a barbecue at home with her family Feb. 19, when she and a friend went upstairs to hang out. “We discovered them an hour to two hours after they had taken these pills. My daughter was already dead,” Vaughn said Monday. Her friend was able to be revived. The girls had taken what they believed was Percocet but actually contained fentanyl, the highly potent and addictive synthetic opiate that can be deadly with a dose as small as the tip of a pencil. “She made one mistake,"" Vaughn said. ""But because fentanyl is so deadly, that mistake cost her her life.” Vaughn believes more data collection on the drugs circulating in the community and better communication with parents about those dangers could have saved his daughter's life. “If we had known that Percocet was going around Plano Senior High School, we would have sat down with Sienna and talk to her about it,” he said. “We need a big time awareness campaign that goes out there for parents and children because the message isn’t getting through.” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, announced Monday that he will soon introduce legislation aimed at combating the nation’s worsening fentanyl crisis, including providing additional support to programs that raise awareness about the drug's dangers. The Substance Use Disorder Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Act of 2023, which Cornyn said he would introduce in a few weeks, would reauthorize programs aimed at reducing demand for drugs, provide assistance to law enforcement agencies and service providers, and direct funding to grant programs that support people recovering from substance use disorders. The legislation would “help improve the Drug-Free Communities prevention program,"" Cornyn said. ""It would help law enforcement dismantle the trafficking organizations that sell these drugs and provide more support for those who are battling substance use disorders."" He also called on President Joe Biden and the federal government to do more to combat the trafficking of drugs across the southern border into the U.S. “We know that this crisis is hitting very close to home here in North Texas,” where several children have died and others have “escaped the fatal consequences,"" he said. Cornyn talked about the measure at a roundtable discussion at a high school in Carrollton, where nearly a dozen teenagers in one school district have overdosed on fentanyl this school year. The fallout has devastated and angered the community, including parents who have criticized the school district for not intervening sooner to stop drug use on school grounds. He was joined by students, representatives from local law enforcement and two local school districts, and parents, like Lilia Astudillo, who have lost children to the fentanyl crisis. ""I never imagined something like this could happen to my family,"" said Astudillo, whose 14-year-old son, Jose Alberto Perez, died of a fentanyl overdose. ""My son was more than a statistic, he wasn’t just a number among the thousands that have died from this drug. He was a precious soul, he was a human being full of life and dreams."" More than 1,600 Texans died from a fentanyl-related overdose in 2021, up 89% from 2020, Cornyn’s office said. The number of fentanyl-related deaths among young people also has climbed. Median monthly overdose deaths involving fentanyl for people ages 10 to 19 increased 182% from July to December 2019 compared to the same period in 2021, according to a December report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 2,200 teens fatally overdosed in the two and a half year period from July 2019 to December 2021, with fentanyl involved in 84% of the deaths, the report found. At R.L. Turner High School in Carrollton, where multiple students have experienced fentanyl poisoning, students have been taught how to recognize the signs of an overdose. Saniyah Rodriguez, a sophomore, said she had to put those lessons into practice five weeks ago when she knew that the ""gurgling"" sound she heard coming from a school bathroom was a student overdosing. “It was frightening, but I knew to get help,” Rodriguez said. The experience, however, has left her shaken. “What I experienced did traumatize me,” she said. "
Richard Lewis says he has Parkinson’s disease and is 'finished with stand-up' comedy,Variety,"April 24, 2023, 3:07 PM UTC",Celebrity,"Stand-up comedian and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actor Richard Lewis revealed in a video posted Sunday on Twitter that he has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The comedian said he’s had “sort of a rocky time” over the past three years with his health. In addition to Parkinson’s disease, Lewis had several surgeries on his shoulder, back and hip. For these reasons, Lewis is strictly focusing on “writing and acting” these days and is no longer performing stand-up. “Hey listen, I just wrapped a couple of weeks ago season 12 of ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ and it was just an amazing season and I’m so grateful to be a part of that show,” Lewis said. “But you know the last 3 1/2 years, I’ve had sort of a rocky time and people said, ‘I haven’t heard from you, are you still touring?’” “Here’s really what happened,” Lewis continued. “Three and half years ago I was in the middle of a tour and I finally ended it with a show. I said, ‘You know I’m at the top of my game, after 15 years almost I’m going to call it quits,’ and I felt great about that and then out of the blue the s--- hit the fan. I had four surgeries back to back to back to back, it was incredible, I couldn’t believe it, it was bad luck, but that’s life.” “I just wanted to let you know that’s where it’s been at,” he concluded. “I’m finished with stand-up. I’m just focusing on writing and acting. I have Parkinson’s disease but I’m under a doctor’s care and everything is cool. I love my wife, I love my little puppy dog and I love all my friends and my fans. And now you know where it’s been at the last three and a half years. God bless you.” Lewis said his Parkinson’s diagnosis came after he “went to a neurologist and they gave me a brain scan” because he noticed some shifty movements in his feet. He added: “That was about two years ago. But luckily I got it late in life and they say you progress very slowly if at all and I’m on the right meds so I’m cool.” On “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” which is expected to debut its 12th season on HBO before the end of the year, Lewis plays a fictionalized version of himself. The comedian is also known for starring in the sitcom “Anything but Love” and the film “Robin Hood: Men in Tights.” Despite recent reports that “Curb Your Enthusiasm” would end after its 12th season, the series is expected to continue as long as creator Larry David wants to keep going.

"Leg-lengthening surgery is gaining popularity among men seeking to be taller, doctors say",Uwa Ede-Osifo,"April 23, 2023, 11:18 AM UTC",Men's Health,"At 5'7"", Alex considered himself short. The 26-year-old, who asked that his real name not be used to maintain his privacy, said he was sick of insults and jeering comments about his height. Shorter men “routinely get spoken down to just because of this trait that they can’t control,” Alex said. So last January, he got a leg-lengthening operation to increase his height to 5’10"". “My goal was never to be tall. It’s to be in a place where no one comments on my height,” Alex said. Leg lengthening is an intense and expensive process but one that has become more popular and accepted in the last five years, according to Dr. Shahab Mahboubian, a surgeon at the Height Lengthening Institute in Burbank, California, who performed Alex’s operations. “I even have 60-, 65-year-old guys that have come to me to undergo the procedure because it just doesn’t stop. The 'short' jokes keep going on and they feel inferior,” he said. The $75,000, four-hour operation, which is not generally covered by insurance, involves cutting the thigh bones in each leg and inserting rods inside them. Then over the next three to four months, the rods are lengthened by up to 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) per day, via an external remote control. New bone grows over the rods. Physical therapy is required: For four months following his surgery, Alex went four to five times per week and used a walker. As he regained his mobility, he switched to using a cane. The final step of the process is removing the rods. Alex returned for that hourlong procedure a year after the first operation, and his insurance footed the $10,000 bill. In total, Alex estimated the whole process cost him $100,000. He said he initially dismissed the idea of leg lengthening as “insane,” but later decided it would make him happier in his body. “If all it is, is pain and money, alright,” he said. Mahboubian said he expects to perform 50 stature-lengthening operations this year, more than double the 20 he did three years ago. Traditionally, leg-extension operations are reconstructive procedures to correct discrepancies in the length of legs, according to Dr. S. Robert Rozbruch, chief of the limb lengthening and complex reconstruction service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. He said that only a small share of the operations he performs are aimed at increasing a patient's height, and those cases usually involve short stature dysphoria, a deep dissatisfaction with one's height. Rozbruch said that he would not want leg lengthening to be thought of as a quick operation done for cosmetic reasons. Alex said he felt so distressed by his height before his surgery that at times, he would walk around his neighborhood and cry. “I went to therapy regarding this to talk about body image issues, but then it always gets followed into, ‘Oh, you have body dysmorphia?’” he said. “It’s almost the opposite where I’m painfully aware of what the reality of my body is, and I wanted to change it.” In popular culture, Alex added, short men can wind up being a punchline for jokes. “Body shaming is wrong, but there’s like a little asterisk of like, ‘unless you’re short,’” he said. “It seems like almost the one unchangeable trait that is just accepted as a societal punching bag.” Even references to “short kings” — a term used in modern dating for men of short stature who are confident and attractive but might otherwise be overlooked due to their height — seem mocking and backhanded, Alex said. Dr. David Frederick, an associate professor of psychology at Chapman University in Southern California, studies body image satisfaction. In a 2006 study, he found that whereas just 26% of shorter men were satisfied with their height, 87% of tall men were happy with their height. “When it’s such an intense, persistent feeling that it impacts your daily functioning in daily life, it becomes an issue,” he said. A study published last year examined the relationship between height and dating preferences among heterosexual people in the U.S., Canada, Cuba and Norway. The results suggested that men preferred shorter women and women preferred taller men relative to both their own heights and the averages in their countries. Some research also suggests there are economic benefits to being tall. A 6-foot person was predicted to earn $166,000 more than a 5'5"" person over a 30-year career, a 2004 study found. Writer Malcolm Gladwell polled half the companies on the Fortune 500 list about the height of their CEOs in 2005 and found that 58% were taller than 6 feet, even though just 14% of American men are that tall. A combination of factors likely explains the CEO trend, Frederick said: Taller stature is sometimes associated with dominance, but it's also indicative that someone grew up with ""more resources and wealth."" Although leg-lengthening surgery comes with risks, including nerve injury and a loss of range of motion, the procedure is safe as long as it’s done by experienced surgeons, according to Rozbruch. Two months have passed since Alex's second operation, and he said he no longer frets about his height. “The recovery is behind me and I feel incredible,” he said. But Alex added that he is wary of recommending the surgery to others, since that would imply that shorter men should change. Instead, he said, the societal pressures to be taller are the problem. “No one should feel the need to do this,” he said. "
Possible links between Covid shots and tinnitus emerge,Erika Edwards,"April 23, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Coronavirus,"Thousands of people say they've developed tinnitus after they were vaccinated against Covid. While there is no proof yet that the vaccines caused the condition, theories for a possible link have surfaced among researchers. Shaowen Bao, an associate professor in the physiology department of the College of Medicine at the University of Arizona, Tucson, believes that ongoing inflammation, especially in the brain or spinal cord, may be to blame. Bao, a longtime tinnitus sufferer and a representative of the American Tinnitus Association's scientific advisory board, has studied tinniuts for more than a decade. A Facebook group of people who developed tinnitus after getting a Covid vaccine convinced Bao to look into the possible link. He ultimately surveyed 398 of the group's participants. The cases tended to be severe. One man told Bao that he couldn’t hear the car radio over the noise in his head while driving. Along with ringing in their ears, participants reported a range of other symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, vertigo, ear pain, anxiety and depression. Significantly more people first developed tinnitus after the first dose of the vaccine, compared with the second. This suggests ""that the vaccine is interacting with pre-existing risk factors for tinnitus. If you have the risk factor, you will probably get it from the first dose,"" Bao said. He is still analyzing the results and has not published any preliminary findings. As of Sunday, at least 16,183 people had filed complaints with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that they'd developed tinnitus, or ringing in their ears, after receiving a Covid vaccine. After internal reviews of the reports, the CDC ""did not find any data suggesting a link between Covid-19 vaccines and tinnitus,"" an agency spokesperson said in an email. The CDC has not, however, made those reviews public, as it did after looking into other possible vaccine side effects, such as inflammation of the heart or myocarditis — frustrating leading vaccine expert Dr. Gregory Poland, founder and director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota. ""Why has the CDC not done all of the research that they should do on this and published it?"" Poland said. Poland, who was stricken with tinnitus after he received his Covid vaccines two years ago, suggested that the CDC remains ""unconcerned"" about these reports of tinnitus. In his case, the noise sounds like a constant, shrill whistle. The din has not improved, and it continues to affect his sleep and quality of life. “There are some days where I’m busy or haven’t been exposed too much in the way of noise, where it’s tolerable. Other days, I could just scream,” he said. Since speaking publicly about his experience, Poland receives emails from strangers “almost daily” who say they experience the same constant noises and believe it was triggered by the Covid vaccines. ""You don’t ever get over tinnitus,"" he said. What causes the human brain to conjure up sound that affects a person’s daily life? A team at Stanford Medicine Molecular Neurotology Laboratory in California has begun studies to find the potential underlying mechanism of tinnitus. The goal is to find a biomarker that may help identify a person at higher risk of developing tinnitus after receiving a vaccine. “We think that many forms of tinnitus reflect some damage in the inner ear,” said Dr. Konstantina Stankovic, an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon who is leading the new research. “And then the brain tries to compensate for the damage and starts to make sound of its own,” she said. The study is in its earliest phases. Stankovic’s team has collected blood samples from fewer than 20 patients so far. “We may not find anything,” she said. “Or it could be a home run. We just don’t know. We are working as hard as we can to answer these questions.” Tinnitus is common in the United States, affecting as many as 25% of adults, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Children can also develop the condition. It's a phantom noise in a person's ear, meaning that no one else can hear what the patient is hearing. There are many potential causes, including age-related hearing loss, certain medications, ear infections and high blood pressure. The CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System has received reports of tinnitus after other vaccines and infections, including Covid, as well. ""It's not surprising for the CDC to receive reports of tinnitus in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System after vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination,"" a CDC spokesperson said in an email. While a study published last fall found the risk of tinnitus after receiving the Covid vaccine is “low,” that doesn’t mean it’s nonexistent. Poland believes the virus's spike protein may play a role, the same way it could continue to wreak havoc in the body in other ways. ""After mRNA vaccines, there is some level of spike protein that circulates,"" Poland said. Could it be much like the spike protein in the heart that leads to myocarditis? Could the same thing happen in the inner ear?"" Researchers at Yale University have begun enrolling participants in a study to learn more about symptoms of long Covid, including tinnitus. ""There's a heterogeneity of manifestations of long Covid,"" Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale University and clinical long Covid researcher, said. ""We really need to be able to map this and organize it in a way that we can understand it."" Anecdotally, people have long reported a link between Covid infection and odd tingling or buzzing in different parts of their body. Krumholz speculates that tinnitus may be caused by internal vibrations in the ear. ""The strategy we’re taking is both to listen very carefully to the experience of people who are suffering and to try to correlate their experiences with what's going on inside their bodies,"" he said. ""These people are suffering."" There is no diagnostic test for tinnitus, but experts suggest first seeing an ear, nose and throat specialist to rule out any underlying causes of ringing in the ears, such as an ear infection or high blood pressure. Otherwise, there are no standard, proven ways of treating tinnitus. Poland, who is also a minister, finds meditative prayer helpful in quelling the noise. He also listens to calming, classical music or ""orange noise"" in his air pods. ""Then I can sort of relax,"" Poland said. ""I actually visualize a volume dial turning that noise down. It's always an effort, but it helps, at least temporarily."" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
Some people taking weight loss drugs say they're experiencing hair loss,Kaitlin Sullivan,"April 22, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Health news,"As drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic soar in popularity for weight loss, pounds aren’t the only thing people report losing: Social media  groups for people taking the medications include posts about losing hair, too. “What is really striking for folks is that there are no scalp symptoms. It doesn’t hurt, there’s no itching, but you can run your hands through your hair and you have a handful of hair. It can be really disconcerting to see that,” said Dr. Susan Massick, a dermatologist at Ohio State University, who has seen patients who have lost hair following weight loss surgery. Semaglutide — better known by the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy — and tirzepatide, sold under the brand name Mounjaro, were originally intended for people with Type 2 diabetes. But the medications are frequently prescribed for weight loss, as well. (Wegovy is approved for weight loss by the Food and Drug Administration, while Ozempic and Mounjaro are given off-label.) Although hair loss a shocking side effect, Dr. Vijaya Surampudi, assistant director of the UCLA weight management program in Los Angeles, said it’s relatively uncommon among people taking the medications. Hair loss is not listed as a side effect of Ozempic, but in clinical trials for Wegovy, 3% of people reported hair loss, compared to 1% of people who got a placebo. (While Ozempic and Wegovy are the same drug, Wegovy is given at a higher dose.) In a clinical trial for tirzepatide’s effects on weight loss, nearly 6% of people taking the highest dose reported alopecia — a generic word for any type of hair loss — compared to 1% of those who got a placebo. Tirzepatide drugmaker Eli Lilly said in a statement that the hair loss seen in the clinical trial was generally short-lived. “Hair loss is a side effect that has been associated with significant weight loss in many previous clinical trials for obesity treatment,” the statement said. Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, did not respond to a request for comment. The drugs work by targeting receptors in the body that are involved with producing insulin and regulating digestion. Neither are related to hair growth. “Hair loss is unlikely related to the drugs,” said Surampudi, who has counseled patients who have experienced hair loss while on the medications, “but more likely related to weight loss that is a result of these drugs.” Hair loss during a time of stress, whether it is pregnancy, divorce or dramatic weight loss, is extremely common. The condition even has its own name: telogen effluvium. Because semaglutide and tirzepatide suppress appetite, people typically eat significantly less than their bodies are used to while taking the drugs. “You’re shocking the system,” Surampudi said. While taking the medication, people can lose 5%-20% of their body weight in six to 12 months before weight loss plateaus. “That’s a considerable change for anyone,” Massick said. Under normal conditions, people are constantly shedding and growing hair. But shock causes the body to reserve resources for essential functions. Hair growth shifts to what’s known as the resting phase: Hair continues to shed but, at the same time, stops growing. The phenomenon is temporary and doesn’t affect everyone. “There is generally a three-month lag after weight loss stops, when you hit that plateau, that the shedding will slowly start to dissipate and hair will start to grow back,” Massick said. Dr. Andrew Kraftson, director of the weight navigation program at Michigan Medicine, compares the phenomenon to a tree in autumn. Trees lose their leaves but no buds replace them until spring. Hair loss is a common side effect of significant weight loss during a short period of time, and people who undergo bariatric, or weight loss surgery, are usually warned ahead of time that this could be a side effect. “It’s extremely common for people after bariatric surgery to lose quite a bit of hair. It’s one of the biggest complaints I hear and people are worried they’re going to go bald,” Kraftson said. Experts said that will not happen from weight loss alone. “With telogen effluvium, you will not lose all your hair, you will not go bald, and it will grow back, so it’s not a permanent situation,” Massick said, adding that once weight stabilizes, the body will once again start allocating resources to nonessential functions such as hair growth. Although there are some cases in which genetic hair loss or hair loss due to another condition coincidentally overlap with telogen effluvium, in which cases hair will not grow back on its own, this usually is not the case, Surampudi said. More commonly, because people are eating less while on weight loss drugs, they may not be getting enough of some vital nutrients, which can also contribute to hair loss. Dr. Priya Jaisinghani, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone in New York City, said that poor diet, calorie restriction or protein restriction can contribute to hair loss that’s seen with significant weight loss. “I counsel my patients from the beginning to avoid hair loss with weight loss,” she said. “But I have many patients from outside providers who come in with these symptoms and we talk about protein intake and rate of weight loss.” Massick agreed that it’s important to discuss your diet with your doctor. Making sure to  include enough protein, iron, B vitamins — especially biotin — and zinc could help prevent some hair shedding if malnutrition is a factor, she added. Iron is important, particularly during menstruation, Surampudi said, and everyone may benefit from taking a vitamin D supplement while on weight loss drugs. All offered reassurances for people experiencing hair loss along with weight loss. If you’re getting enough nutrients, “your hair will rebound and there will be no permanent damage,” Kraftson said.

What the Supreme Court's decision in the legal fight over abortion pills means for access to mifepristone,Aria Bendix,"April 12, 2023, 11:19 PM UTC / Updated April 22, 2023, 12:18 AM UTC",Abortion Rights,"Nationwide access to mifepristone, one of the two pills involved in a medication abortion, will be preserved for now after the Supreme Court blocked a federal judge's ruling in Texas while litigation continues. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled on April 7 that the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone would be put on pause following a seven-day window for the government to appeal. The Justice Department quickly appealed that decision, a process that ultimately put it in front of the Supreme Court. Last week, Justice Samuel Alito said no parts of Kacsmaryk's decision could go into effect until at least Wednesday to give the Supreme Court time to consider next steps. With Friday's decision, the justices granted emergency requests by the federal government and the pill's manufacturer, Danco Laboratories, to put Kacsmaryk's ruling on hold while the case goes back to a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The panel will hear oral arguments May 17. Two conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, noted their dissent, writing that they would have denied the stay. The support of five justices was needed for the court to grant the hold on Kacsmaryk’s ruling. Meanwhile, abortion clinics are readying contingency plans in case mifepristone's FDA approval is later suspended. Here is what is known and still unknown about the future of mifepristone access. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it gave states the authority to decide whether to ban or protect abortion access. But this lawsuit, filed by a coalition of anti-abortion groups called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, seeks to overturn the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, which applies nationwide. The suit alleges that the agency did not adequately evaluate mifepristone’s safety before it greenlighted the drug in 2000, and it argues that the FDA should not have made the medication accessible via telehealth. Kacsmaryk’s April 7 ruling was a response to a request from the plaintiffs to pause access to mifepristone while the case proceeds. The Justice Department first appealed Kacsmaryk's decision to the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit, which blocked part of Kacsmaryk's order but said other parts could take effect. A panel of judges determined the plaintiffs had waited too long to challenge the 2000 approval of mifepristone but could legally challenge changes the FDA made to the drug's approved use in 2016, 2019 and 2021. The first of those changes, in 2016, extended the window in which mifepristone could be used to terminate pregnancies from seven weeks' gestation to 10 weeks and reduced the number of in-person visits that patients were required to make from three to one. Then in 2019, the FDA approved a generic form of the drug. And in 2021, it removed a requirement that mifepristone be dispensed only in clinics, medical offices and hospitals, thereby allowing the drug to be administered via telehealth and sent by mail. If the remaining parts of Kacsmaryk’s decision were to go into effect, that would make access to mifepristone look much the way it did prior to 2016. But last week, the Justice Department appealed the 5th Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court and asked it to block Kacsmaryk’s order in full while the appeal is considered. The Supreme Court granted the request. Mifepristone is still available in the 37 states that legally allow some form of medication abortion. The Supreme Court's decision upholds that status quo for now, at least until the 5th Circuit takes the case again in mid-May and the legal process continues. The three-judge panel that will hear the case is likely to be different than the one that decided to let parts of Kacsmaryk's decision stand last week. Alito said in a brief dissenting opinion Friday that a decision to suspend regulatory changes made since 2016 would not have prevented mifepristone from being available. ""At present, the applicants are not entitled to a stay because they have not shown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the interim,"" Alito wrote. ""Contrary to the impression that may be held by many, that disposition would not express any view on the merits of the question whether the FDA acted lawfully in any of its actions regarding mifepristone,"" he added. The Supreme Court's next moves will determine the future of mifepristone access. If Kacsmaryk's pause on the FDA's changes since 2016 is allowed to take effect, patients would need to obtain mifepristone in person before seven weeks' gestation. Around 43% of medication abortions in 2020 happened at seven weeks' gestation or later, according to an NBC News analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A survey published last year found that about 1 in 5 pregnant people discover their pregnancy at or after seven weeks. But providers could still prescribe mifepristone off-label beyond seven weeks based on safety and efficacy data, according to Planned Parenthood. The approved regimen for a medication abortion involves two drugs: mifepristone, which blocks the hormone progesterone, and misoprostol, which induces contractions. If mifepristone is no longer available at some point, most abortion clinics plan to use misoprostol alone to terminate pregnancies. Studies have shown that misoprostol's success rates can range from 84% to 96%, whereas the two-drug combo can be up to 99.6% effective. Both drugs are safe: Misoprostol had a 0.7% risk of major complications, one study found, whereas the two-pill regimen has a slightly lower risk. But taking just misoprostol may cause more intense side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, chills, vomiting or cramping. Surgical abortions are still an option in states where abortion is legal. They are more invasive than pills and involve anesthesia or sedation, but they are slightly more effective and take less time. A medication abortion can take several days. Surgical abortions can also be more expensive. Though costs vary based on insurance, the average cost of a medication abortion at Planned Parenthood is around $580, compared with $600 to $2,000 for a surgical abortion depending on the stage of pregnancy. If the FDA's approval of mifepristone is revoked down the line, access to the drug would not be immediately cut off nationwide, but anyone involved in manufacturing or distributing it could face legal risk. The FDA, though, has broad authority over enforcement, so it could choose not to take action against companies that sell or distribute the drug. Legal experts said it's possible the FDA would have to order Danco to stop manufacturing the drug, meaning supply could become limited. Massachusetts and Washington are stockpiling mifepristone in case supply becomes an issue. Danco could also apply again for FDA approval, but it's unclear what data would be required to support a new application, given the unprecedented nature of the lawsuit and Kacsmaryk's decision. Health policy experts aren't sure if Danco would need to apply for approval under a new indication, submit new trial data, or if the company could rely on data from the 20 years the drug has been on the market. Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project, said it could take several years for the FDA to approve mifepristone again, with at least 10 months for the review process alone. Less than an hour after Kacsmaryk’s ruling on April 7, a federal judge in Washington state ordered the FDA to maintain the status-quo availability of mifepristone in 17 states and Washington, D.C., while a different lawsuit over abortion pills plays out. In that case, a group of attorneys general alleged that the FDA's current restrictions on distributing mifepristone unnecessarily hinder access. The judge reiterated last week that the FDA must comply with his order regardless of the decisions from Kacsmaryk or the 5th Circuit in the other case. Legal experts said the Washington-based judge's order helped expedite the case to the Supreme Court, given that the two federal judges' rulings directly conflict. A victory for the plaintiffs could undermine the entire drug approval process in the U.S. and open the floodgates for legal challenges to vaccines or other essential medications disputed by certain groups, legal experts said. Reversing FDA approval, they added, could disincentivize pharmaceutical companies from investing in research and development for new treatments or therapies. ""This is opening the door to basically anybody challenging any drug that they disapprove of on the theory that somebody might get hurt,"" said Wendy Parmet, director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern University. Dozens of pharmaceutical stakeholders, including companies and executives, filed an amicus brief last week asserting that Kacsmaryk's decision would delay patient access to lifesaving medications and make it more difficult to bring new drugs to market. A group of more than 200 medical organizations and pharmaceutical companies also signed an open letter in which they criticize the judge for undermining the FDA's authority to approve and regulate safe, effective medicines. Kacsmaryk determined earlier this month that the FDA's regulatory changes since 2016 opened up mifepristone's entire approval to new challenges. The 5th Circuit, however, disagreed. The anti-abortion doctors involved in the suit say that treating patients for the side effects of abortion pills has exposed them to allegations of malpractice and potential liability, placed stress on them in emergency situations, and taken up medical resources that could be used for other purposes. But lawyers for the FDA and Danco have argued that the plaintiffs did not sufficiently demonstrate that the FDA's approval of mifepristone harmed them. ""No one denies that there are adverse consequences, adverse effects to any medication, including any over-the-counter painkiller or cold medication,"" Parmet said. ""That those people might end up in these plaintiffs' offices and somehow it will affect these doctors' ability to practice and their relationship with their patients — that's just absurd.” The current fight is over an early step in the legal process: the request for a preliminary injunction. Once this particular appeals process ends, Kacsmaryk could decide to hold a trial with witness testimony or to issue a summary judgment right away. If the Justice Department loses the case, it could appeal to the 5th Circuit, then the Supreme Court. Parmet said the battle over Kacsmaryk's injunction order is essentially a preview of the larger legal battle ahead, though new debates could arise as the lawsuit is adjudicated.

"Tennessee blocked $8 million for HIV, now ends up with $13 million, stunning advocates",Benjamin Ryan,"April 21, 2023, 6:26 PM UTC",OUT Health and Wellness,"In a turnaround that has stunned and pleasantly surprised HIV advocates, Tennessee has gone from blocking $8.3 million in annual federal funds for HIV prevention, surveillance and treatment to including a new allotment of $9 million in the state budget approved Thursday to combat the virus. This development came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that it will circumvent the state government and continue providing about $4 million in HIV-prevention funds to Tennessee nonprofit groups, despite Gov. Bill Lee’s objections. The state has one of the nation’s most poorly controlled HIV epidemics. Lee previously singled out the Tennessee Transgender Task Force and Planned Parenthood to be defunded from the CDC’s HIV-prevention grant to the state. The president of the task force, Ray Holloman, expressed hope that a cumulative $13 million budget will be “used to benefit the most vulnerable and at-risk populations.” But he shared HIV experts’ concerns that the new state funds, which will support county health departments and nonprofit groups, might not be spent wisely. Jade Byers, a Lee spokesperson, said the $9 million in new state funding to combat HIV would recur and allow Tennessee to “provide better services and reach even more at-risk populations in the state, such as victims of human trafficking, mothers and children, and first responders.” But none of these groups experience substantial HIV transmissions, the majority of which occur among gay and bisexual men, both in Tennessee and nationally. Blacks and Latinos are particularly at risk, as are trans individuals and people who inject drugs. Toni Newman, a director of the HIV advocacy nonprofit organization NMAC, called the new state funds “a step forward.” “But the real impact of this move will be determined by how the money is distributed,” Newman said. “Without a clear understanding of where the money is going and who it will benefit, we risk worsening the HIV epidemic in our state.” In recent years, the CDC has granted Tennessee $6.2 million annually for HIV prevention and surveillance, delivering the money to the state Health Department. The state has then sent about $4 million of those funds to the United Way of Greater Nashville, which has in turn distributed the cash to various community-based organizations fighting HIV throughout the state. The remaining $2 million or so of the CDC grant has supported surveillance of HIV in Tennessee. In January, the Lee administration announced that beginning in the new fiscal year, which starts June 1, it would block all $6.2 million of the CDC HIV funding, plus a separate $2.1 million annual federal grant for HIV prevention and treatment in Shelby County, home to Memphis. Outraged HIV advocates and experts said Lee’s move would spawn a public health crisis. The CDC estimates that new HIV cases declined nationally by 8% from 2015 to 2019, a statistic that masks heady progress in some states and either stagnancy or increases in most of the South, where the bulk of transmissions occur. Even as liberal states such as New York and California have invested heavily in fighting the virus and seen substantial declines, the CDC estimates that Tennessee’s transmissions increased somewhat from 2017 to 2019. A February NBC News investigation into the governor’s motivation for blocking the funds traced its origins, at least in part, to attacks on Vanderbilt University’s care for transgender children by far-right media stars, including the Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh. These attacks triggered a chain reaction that, fueled by Republican animus toward Planned Parenthood, gathered steam and ultimately politicized the Tennessee Health Department’s HIV prevention efforts. Walsh and the Daily Wire did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment. Planned Parenthood declined to comment. Along with a cadre of national and state HIV organizations, NMAC has spent the past three months lobbying the CDC to ensure funding continuity. On Monday, the CDC announced plans for an end run around the Tennessee Health Department, pledging to deliver $4 million in HIV grant funds directly to the United Way during the next fiscal year. In January, Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat representing Memphis, sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra asking the agency to circumvent the Tennessee Health Department and provide the $2.1 million federal grant directly to Shelby County. The Memphis area has the nation’s third-highest HIV diagnosis rate, the CDC reports. Representatives for Becerra and Cohen did not respond to inquiries about that grant’s status. Earlier in the year, the Lee administration pledged to replace the blocked $8.3 million in federal funding with state money — a promise kept by the $56 billion state budget approved by the Legislature in Nashville on Thursday. “Tennessee is pursuing a stronger HIV prevention and awareness program at the state level that will allow community partners to access more funding,” Byers said. In January, she said that spending state instead of federal dollars to fight HIV would permit Tennessee more “independence” in its use of funds. Sarah Bishop, a United Way of Greater Nashville spokesperson, said the organization would continue funding all the current CDC grantees come June. Dr. Richard Briggs, a surgeon and a Republican state senator representing Knoxville, celebrated Tennessee’s comparatively fulsome new HIV budget. Yet he still criticized Lee, also a Republican, for blocking the federal money. “We should accept all the federal funds,” Briggs said. Following Lee’s announcement in January, Friends for Life, an $8.5 million Memphis nonprofit that provides HIV prevention and treatment services, faced losing nearly $500,000 in CDC grant funding, according to Mia Cotton, its chief programs officer. Without a federal contract, the organization also would have become ineligible for $1.2 million in annual pharmaceutical rebates. Now the nonprofit will receive a windfall of $891,000 from the state, plus continued CDC funding, which will maintain its rebate eligibility. Cotton expressed relief and gratitude over this reversal of fortune. “It is important to note, however, that unless we all work together,” Cotton said, alluding to the governor’s determination to detach the state’s spending from the CDC, “new transmissions of HIV will not be contained.” "
"Inhalant that contributed to Aaron Carter's death needs more regulation, advocates say",Aria Bendix,"April 20, 2023, 9:14 PM UTC",Health news,"Pressure to enact rules discouraging the use of an inhalant that contributed to singer Aaron Carter's death has met resistance from federal regulators in recent years. The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office determined this week that Carter accidentally drowned in his bathtub in November after inhaling difluoroethane, a compressed gas found in aerosol cleaners for electronic devices. The medical examiner’s report also showed that the singer had taken alprazolam, a drug better known by its brand name, Xanax. The cause of death was drowning due to the effects of both substances, the report said. Inhaling difluoroethane can cause people to lose consciousness, and it has also been linked to fatal heart and lung issues. But various household aerosol products, some marketed as keyboard cleaners or computer dusters, contain difluoroethane. The accessibility of these products makes it easy for minors to become addicted, according to Scott Bowen, a psychology professor at Wayne State University who researches the effects of inhalant use. “Huffing is one of the things that can start very young — 12, 13, 14 years of age — and it’s because it’s so easy to get,” Bowen said. “It’s harder to get alcohol.” The nonprofit group Families United Against Inhalant Abuse has pushed for tighter federal restrictions on aerosol duster products, including harsher labels. But the Consumer Product Safety Commission has questioned whether those proposed changes would stop people from abusing difluoroethane. The nonprofit group filed a petition in 2021 asking the CPSC to adopt a mandatory safety standard for products containing difluoroethane or its derivatives. In particular, the group wanted stronger language added to the items’ warning labels, such as the words “danger” and “death.” It also asked the commission to require products with difluoroethane to carry an ingredient that makes them taste or smell bitter to discourage people from inhaling them. Some aerosol duster products already contain this type of additive, which has not been shown to have much impact on substance abuse. But Families United Against Inhalant Abuse says there may be more effective options. The CPSC deferred the petition in July to allow staff more time to research the issue. A commission spokesperson told NBC News that its “technical staff is currently conducting that research in an effort to develop further information to provide in a briefing package to the Commission on this issue no later than the end of the fiscal year.” However, in a briefing at the time of the deferral, staffers expressed reservations about the effectiveness of the proposed safety standards. They recommended against requirements to add bitter substances and voiced concerns that a harsher warning label could have the unintended effect of encouraging substance use. Adults represent the majority of people who abuse inhalants, according to CPSC data. From 2006 to 2020, the commission received reports of 1,133 hazardous incidents from huffing aerosol duster products. Of those cases, 70% were male, and more than 92% were people ages 18-54. All but seven cases resulted in death. Many states have laws that impose fines or jail time on people who sell or possess inhalants for the purpose of becoming intoxicated. Claudia Dimit, the board president of Families United Against Inhalant Abuse, said she isn't optimistic that new standards will be implemented as a result of her petition. Her larger goal, she said, is to push for federal restrictions that cap how often aerosol duster products can be purchased, or that require products to be sold behind the counter. ""It would be wonderful if we could get the product banned altogether, but because of the power of the industry and the money involved, I don't see that happening,"" Dimit said. Dimit started her organization in 2018, six years after her son, Brandon, died from inhalant use. He had first used the product just 20 days earlier, she said. New legislation doesn't always help curb substance abuse, Bowen said: “We’ve had these really strict drug laws in place for 50 years, and if you go look at drug use, it hasn’t changed."" But he added that educating kids and parents about the dangers of inhalants, whether through school programs or public announcements, could be effective. Many people aren’t aware of the presence of chemicals in aerosol products, Bowen said, and falsely believe they just contain canned air. Plenty of people also don't realize that using an inhalant just once can have fatal consequences, he added. “It’s kind of like the silent epidemic that just lies under the radar,” Bowen said. "
"Over-the-counter Narcan to cost less than $50 for a two-pack, company says",Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"April 20, 2023, 7:25 PM UTC",Health news,"When Narcan finally becomes available over the counter later this year, the price may put the lifesaving antidote out of reach for many people, experts say. Emergent BioSolutions said Thursday that it plans to price the opioid overdose reversal medication at less than $50 for two doses. “In my own clinical practice, there have been times when families have needed to pay $30 for a copay for Narcan, and this has been too expensive for them,” said Dr. Scott Hadland, an addiction specialist at Mass General for Children in Boston. “In many instances, the families I work with have chosen not to pay this.” The Food and Drug Administration approved Narcan, or naloxone, for over-the-counter use last month, a move experts hailed as one that's expected to increase access to the crucial medication. The approval means the rescue drug could be sold in places such as convenience stores, grocery stores and vending machines, in addition to drugstores. Although the drug was previously prescription-only, many states have workarounds that allow people to get it directly from a pharmacist. In many places, it's also available for free at community centers, local health departments and needle-exchange programs. That's important because it removes barriers to access, said Dr. Leslie Walker-Harding, the chair of pediatrics at the University of Washington and chief academic officer at Seattle Children's Hospital, who equated it to having defibrillators in public spaces. The below-$50 price tag for Narcan announced by Emergent BioSolutions is less than the current list price for the medication, which is around $130 for a two-dose box, according to GoodRx, a group that tracks prescription drug prices. Even so, it may be too much. The price tag “could seem like a small price to pay to save someone’s life, but at that price there will be many who will not be able to afford the purchase,” Walker-Harding said. “It is unlikely that most folks will drop $40 to $50 on Narcan,” said Dr. Michael Barnett, an associate professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “They are also prioritizing rent, food, and also paying for opioids, which we want them to decrease.” Many people with opioid addiction live well below the federal poverty line, Barnett said. A report from KFF, a nonprofit organization focused on health policy, found that 6 in 10 uninsured adults with opioid use disorder have low incomes. More than a third of them had incomes 100% to 200% below the federal poverty line. The over-the-counter Narcan will come packaged with two 4-milligram doses, administered as a nasal spray, according to Matt Hartwig, a spokesperson for Emergent BioSolutions. Both doses may be needed to reverse an overdose. It is expected to come in a larger box with images and detailed instructions to help people administer the drug more easily. Most insurance companies cover the prescription version of Narcan, leaving patients with copays. Over-the-counter drugs, however, generally aren't covered by insurance, meaning people would have to pay the full price, said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at KFF. ""There’s an inevitable tension when drugs like Narcan are approved for over-the-counter sale,"" Levitt said. ""These drugs become more accessible over the counter, but also ironically more expensive for patients in many cases if insurance doesn’t cover them."" Hartwig, of Emergent, said it is not yet known whether insurance companies will cover the over-the-counter version of Narcan. NBC News has asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services whether the federal government will provide coverage for the drug. Barnett said that if insurance doesn't cover the drug, he hopes Narcan will still be available by prescription or could be paid for via a voucher. Generic versions of Narcan, sold by other drugmakers, are still available with a prescription. ""The whole point of having Narcan is protecting those who are using it,"" Barnett said.

European group that mails abortion pills to the U.S. says it saw enormous surge in requests this month,Chantal Da Silva,"April 20, 2023, 7:22 PM UTC",Abortion Rights,"A group in Europe that prescribes abortion pills to people in the U.S. online said it has seen a surge in requests since a federal judge in Texas issued a decision imperiling future access to mifepristone. ""We have seen an enormous ... increase in requests since the ruling in Texas,"" said Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, a Dutch physician who runs the service called Aid Access. ""People are extremely anxious."" She said she could not yet quantify the precise size of the surge but added that it ""has been a steep increase."" The Supreme Court has blocked the decision from U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk from taking effect until at least Friday night. Kacsmaryk ruled April 7 that the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone — one of the two pills in the standard regimen for a medication abortion — would be paused while a case challenging it plays out. An appeals court subsequently blocked part of the judge's decision but said changes the FDA made to the drug’s approved use since 2016 could be temporarily reversed. The government then appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. The legal fight has created considerable uncertainty about the future of access to mifepristone. Abigail Aiken, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Texas, Austin, has been tracking requests for self-managed medication abortion. She said a recent increase in inquiries to Aid Access would be “in line with what I would expect, given the confusion the decision and the ensuing back-and-forth legal process is likely to cause to people seeking abortion care.” “We saw a similar sharp spike in requests at the time the Dobbs decision was leaked, about a month before the decision was formally announced,” she said, referring to the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. “Even though there hadn’t been any changes to state abortion laws at the time of the leak, there was still a rapid increase in requests to the Aid Access service.” Gomperts founded Aid Access in 2018. Those who visit the organization's website can answer a series of questions, and a medical team reviews the responses and can write prescriptions. The prescriptions then get sent to pharmacies outside the U.S., and the pills are shipped by mail to patients. The FDA said it “does not recommend” ordering mifepristone online, and has sent warning letters to websites “selling unapproved and misbranded mifepristone and misoprostol over the internet, including AidAccess.” That has not stopped Gomperts. In March 2019, the FDA, under then-President Donald Trump, sent a warning letter asking the organization to cease operations. Aid Access refused. “For me, it’s really, fundamentally, about social justice. It’s a very urgent medical need that people have,” Gomperts said of abortion pills. Denying access is ""very discriminatory,"" she added, since such bans affect women, transgender people and those with limited financial resources. The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the agency's current stance on Aid Access’ work. Aiken published research last year showing that average daily requests to Aid Access for abortion medication increased by 160% following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision. Whereas the group got an average of 83 requests per day in the period from September 2021 through April 2022, the number jumped to 214 between June 24 and Aug. 31, 2022. The upward trend has continued, with an average of 254 requests per day between September 2022 and January, Aiken added. ""That’s a 206% increase over baseline,"" she said. Access to medication abortion is currently legal in some form in 37 U.S. states. The regimen involves taking mifepristone followed by another drug, misoprostol. It is the most common way to terminate an early pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group advocating for abortion rights. Mifepristone is widely used around the world and approved in more than 80 other countries, according to the FDA. The FDA maintains that medication abortion is safe and says periodic reviews of data on mifepristone's use ""have not identified any new safety concerns."" Research has shown that the two-pill regimen has a 0.4% risk of major complications. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit challenging mifepristone, however, allege that the drug is unsafe, and Kacsmaryk agreed with them in his decision — a stance Gomperts called ""outrageous."" “It’s definitely safer than giving birth, so the arguments that are being used are so outrageous, anti-scientific, it scares me,"" she said. ""It really scares me that this is possible that there’s a group of people who are able to determine the lives of other people based on bulls---."" "
"People around the world lost faith in childhood vaccines during pandemic, UNICEF says",Reuters,"April 20, 2023, 2:41 PM UTC",Kids' Health,"People all over the world lost confidence in the importance of routine childhood vaccines against killer diseases like measles and polio during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new report from UNICEF. In 52 of the 55 countries surveyed, the public perception of vaccines for children declined between 2019 and 2021, the UN agency said. The data was a “worrying warning signal” of rising vaccine hesitancy amid misinformation, dwindling trust in governments and political polarization, UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund, said. “We cannot allow confidence in routine immunizations to become another victim of the pandemic,” Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director, said in a statement. “Otherwise, the next wave of deaths could be of more children with measles, diphtheria or other preventable diseases.” The change in perception was particularly worrying, the agency said, as it comes after the largest sustained backslide in childhood immunization in a generation during Covid disruptions. In total, 67 million children missed out on one or more potentially lifesaving vaccines during the pandemic, and efforts to catch up have so far stalled despite increasing outbreaks. The picture on vaccine confidence varied globally, according to the UNICEF report, its flagship annual State of the World’s Children. In countries including Papua New Guinea and South Korea, agreement with the statement “vaccines are important for children” declined by 44%, and by more than a third in Ghana, Senegal and Japan. In the United States, it declined by 13.6 percentage points. In India, China and Mexico, confidence remained broadly the same or increased, the report added. The report stressed that vaccine confidence can easily shift and the results may not indicate a long-term trend. Despite the fall in confidence, more than 80% of respondents in almost half of the countries surveyed still said childhood vaccines were important. The data was collected by the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "
Pharmacies are still turning people away as the Adderall shortage continues,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"April 20, 2023, 10:00 AM UTC",Health news,"Seven months into the nationwide shortage of Adderall, pharmacist Steve Moore still gets phone calls every day from people with ADHD asking whether he has the medication in stock. He’ll occasionally get out-of-town visitors, too. “It’s a pretty far drive,” said Moore, who owns Condo Pharmacy in Plattsburgh, New York, a small city just south of the Canadian border. But Moore has to turn them away. Some doses aren’t expected to be available until mid-May at the earliest, a month later than earlier estimates, according to the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage database. “Obviously, I want to help everybody I can,” Moore said, “but if I know I’ve got three patients who need this particular product, I’m really trying to make sure that the patients we know are coming in have what they need.” The FDA first confirmed a nationwide shortage of Adderall in October, after a surge in demand for the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder drug during the coronavirus pandemic. Although supply problems have improved since then, some pharmacies say they are still unable to keep the drug or its generic versions in stock. The supply problem means people with ADHD who need the drug are forced to turn to different medications or wait several weeks to get their prescriptions. “We mainly receive calls from people asking if we have the medication in stock, and we have to tell them that we don’t,” said Mike Koelzer, a pharmacist and the owner of Kay Pharmacy in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Koelzer said the shortage has hurt his business financially because he doesn’t have enough supply for his regular customers, forcing them to seek the drug elsewhere. Sometimes his pharmacy will provide other ADHD medications, but even those medications, like Ritalin, are in short supply too. People are often frustrated and worried, Koelzer added, when they aren’t able to find the medication they need. “We don’t have good answers for them other than to keep checking back or to try another pharmacy,” he said. “It’s been a difficult situation for both us and our customers.” The supply problem could persist for few more weeks or longer. According to the FDA’s drug shortage database, some doses of a generic version of Adderall, from the drugmaker Alvogen, are expected to be in short supply until later this month or mid-May. Granules Pharmaceuticals, another generic manufacturer of Adderall, isn’t expected to have it available until May, according to the agency. Teva Pharmaceuticals, the country’s largest supplier of the brand name Adderall, said in a statement that it isn’t experiencing manufacturing issues or shortages but noted that some pharmacies and patients in the U.S. could experience “intermittent delays” in getting the medication. NBC News has reached out to all 10 companies that list shortages of the drug in the FDA database. Michael Ganio, the senior director of pharmacy practice at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, which tracks drug shortages, said the organization first heard about the supply problems for Adderall about a year ago. At the time, he said, manufacturers attributed the issue to a lack of workers, and since then, they have tried to ramp up production, to varying results. Further complicating matters is that Adderall is a controlled substance regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which sets limits on how much of the active ingredient drugmakers are allowed to produce in a given time frame. Drugmakers must get approval from the DEA before they go over their quotas, he said. “It is very difficult to evaluate the increase in demand, which has been a challenge for manufacturers,” he said, adding that some drugmakers have paused selling the drugs to new customers. In the meantime, pharmacies are adapting. CVS Health and Walgreens said they are aware of the shortages and are continuing to work with suppliers or patients to help meet the demand. “Our pharmacists will work with patients who are prescribed this medication as needed,” Matt Blanchette, a spokesperson for CVS Health, said in a statement. Other pharmacies will have to keep turning patients away. Benjamin Jolley, a pharmacist and the manager of Jolley’s Compounding Pharmacy in Salt Lake City, said the pharmacy isn't taking on any new customers. He was able to buy 10 bottles of Adderall on Wednesday morning, the first time he had been able to buy it in two weeks. “The wholesaler texted me and said: ‘Hey, we’ve got some if you want it. Go buy it right now.’” The purchase means the dozen or so people who get the medication at his pharmacy will be able to get their prescriptions filled. ""It's a hard-to-come-by product,"" Jolley said. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook. "
"Strep infection rates remain high in the U.S., even relative to pre-pandemic levels",Aria Bendix,"April 19, 2023, 11:31 PM UTC",Health news,"Strep infections have persisted at high levels so far this spring, even compared to pre-pandemic years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said unpublished data from its national surveillance program show that emergency department visits for regular strep infections reached a five-year high in February and March. A report from Epic Research, which analyzes electronic health records, suggests that in February, rates of strep throat were nearly 30% higher than during the previous peak in February 2017. Preliminary data suggests the upward trend continued in March, the group told NBC News. The CDC was unable to confirm Epic's statistics since it does not have data on regular strep infections dating back to 2017. But Dr. Michael Cappello, vice chair of pediatrics for Advocate Children’s Hospital in the Chicago area, said that compared to pre-pandemic levels, ""we’re definitely seeing more run-of-the-mill strep throats, without a doubt."" Strep rates are normally highest from December through April, but doctors last year started seeing cases as early as September. Rates of invasive group A strep infections have also been higher than usual. Unlike ordinary strep, invasive cases are severe and sometimes life-threatening; they occur when bacteria spread to areas of the body that are normally germ-free, such as the bloodstream, lungs, joints or bones. A CDC spokesperson said Wednesday that ""many states are continuing to see higher than usual numbers of invasive group A strep cases, particularly in children ages 17 years and younger and adults ages 65 years and older."" The CDC issued a health alert in December about the increase in pediatric cases of invasive group A strep infections. Dr. Maureen Ahmann, a pediatrician at Cleveland Clinic Children’s, said her practice has seen a considerable increase in invasive strep A cases. ""It’s still rare compared to all the other childhood illnesses, but we are seeing a bump,"" Ahmann said. The U.S. records several million cases of noninvasive group A strep per year, but just around 14,000 to 25,000 invasive infections, according to the CDC. Between 1,500 and 2,300 people die of the invasive cases every year. Dr. Sam Dominguez, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado and a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said his hospital saw about 80 cases of invasive strep from October to March. By contrast, there were about five to 10 cases annually in pandemic years and roughly 20 per year before that, he said. ""We have seen really an unprecedented rise in group A strep — more than we’ve probably seen here, looking back, at least for a decade, and probably longer than that,"" Dominguez said. Invasive strep can trigger skin infections like flesh-eating disease, lower airway infections like pneumonia, or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, an immune reaction that can lead to organ failure. The CDC has recorded 117 cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome so far this year, compared to a total of 45 last year. Epic Research’s findings, which have not been peer-reviewed, were based on doctors' office and emergency room visits across more than 1,100 hospitals and 24,900 clinics in the U.S., as well as one health organization in Lebanon, where the group also collects data. According to the report, strep throat was most common in children ages 4 to 13, but all age groups have seen an increase. Doctors have a few theories as to why strep infections have persisted at high levels. One is that cases declined during the pandemic due to Covid mitigation measures, which then left people more susceptible later. A second possible factor is the respiratory virus surge the U.S. saw this winter. Cappello said those viral infections can weaken people's immune systems or irritate the protective lining of the nose, mouth and throat, making it easier to develop strep. ""The other possibility is, maybe this is a different strain of group A strep that we haven’t seen,"" Cappello said. But doctors are optimistic that cases will soon decline. Dominguez and Cappello said their hospitals have seen fewer cases of invasive strep so far in April than in prior months. ""I’m hopeful that means we’re on a downswing,"" Cappello said. The high rate of strep infections has been extra difficult because of a shortage of the antibiotic amoxicillin. The Food and Drug Administration reported a shortage of a powder version of the drug in October, which has not yet resolved. Ahmann said some Ohio parents struggled to fill their kids' liquid amoxicillin prescriptions. ""It got to the point a month ago, if we needed liquid amoxicillin, we would actually print out the script and give it to the parent and say, 'Listen, last I heard, so-and-so down the road had this, but if they don’t, try here,'"" Ahmann said. ""The parents would literally go from pharmacy to pharmacy looking for someone who has it."" But she added that, anecdotally, the shortage finally seems to be easing. Doctors recommend getting kids tested for strep if they have red or sore throats that make it painful to swallow, a fever, swollen lymph nodes or rashes. ""If your child is suddenly not communicating with you, difficult to arouse, incoherent, working really hard to breathe, those kinds of things, that's definitely a trip to go to the emergency room right away,"" Cappello said.

"Early treatment could slow the onset of multiple sclerosis symptoms, study finds",Kaitlin Sullivan,"April 19, 2023, 9:49 PM UTC",Health news,"Starting treatment for multiple sclerosis early — before symptoms even begin — could possibly delay the onset of the condition, new research finds. Preliminary results of a small Phase 3 clinical trial showed a drug called teriflunomide may delay or prevent MS symptoms in people who have what’s known as radiologically isolated syndrome, which causes the same brain and spinal cord lesions seen in people with MS. The findings will be presented next week at the American Academy of Neurology’s 75th annual meeting in Boston. About half of people who have RIS go on to develop MS. “The goal of treatment in the RIS phase is to keep a patient in the 50% that doesn’t convert to MS in 10 years, to stop it before the disease becomes symptomatic,” said Dr. Orhun Kantarci, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and a co-author of the new study. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for RIS, but early intervention is crucial, experts say. “Once damage starts to accumulate and disability starts to develop, we can’t reverse that,” said Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic who was not involved in the research. “So it’s very important to prevent it from happening in the first place.” MS is a central nervous system disease, affecting the brain and the spinal cord. It can cause a number of symptoms that vary in severity, including vision problems, muscle weakness, numbness and difficulty concentrating, according to the National Institutes of Health. People with RIS may have very subtle symptoms that go unnoticed, said Dr. William Shaffer, a neurologist at UCHealth in Fort Collins, Colorado, who was also not involved in the trial. Early treatment could prevent any progression as soon as lesions are detected, he said. The drug teriflunomide, sold under the name Aubagio, is already approved to treat patients with the most common type of MS, called relapsing-remitting MS. It accounts for 85% of all cases. Sanofi, which makes the drug, helped fund the trial. The new trial is the second to test whether an approved MS drug is able to prevent symptoms in people who have RIS. The ARISE trial tested another MS drug, called Tecfidera, in 87 people in the U.S. and found it to be effective at delaying or preventing MS symptoms. The latest study included 89 adults from Europe and Turkey with an average age of 40 who were followed for two years. Seventy percent were female, and all had RIS lesions that showed up on an MRI, but none had symptoms of MS. Compared to those who got a placebo, those who were treated with teriflunomide had a 63% decreased risk of developing early symptoms of MS, including numbness and tingling and issues with balance or dizziness. “The medications seem to work better when they’re started earlier,” Cohen said. Although the trial only lasted two years, Kantarci said this is consistent with how long drugs are studied in clinical trials for MS, and the findings still suggest long-term results. Although early intervention is expected in other diseases that can show up on scans before they cause symptoms, such as breast and colorectal cancers, that isn’t the case for MS, Kantarci said. But unlike breast and colorectal cancer, people aren’t screened for RIS; it’s typically found incidentally when people have a brain or spinal MRI for other reasons. Kantarci doesn’t think that should change; RIS is rare and doesn’t warrant routine screening, he said. What’s more, because only half of patients with RIS go on to develop MS, early treatment would be unwarranted in the other half. “Therapies have side effects and have some risks associated with them like all medications, and they’re expensive,” said Dr. Nancy Sicotte, director of the Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. A better understanding of RIS could help guide doctors to which patients would benefit most from early intervention. Previous research has already identified some specific lesions in RIS patients that appear to indicate a person will go on to develop MS. In the future, Sicotte said, early intervention may be reserved for these patients. Kantarci agreed. Based on previous studies, “we know that some patients are more likely to become symptomatic with MS, including those who are younger or who have problems with their spinal fluids and spinal cord that suggest MS,” he said. “We’d like those to be the ones who receive the treatment.” Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

CDC signs off on 2nd dose of omicron Covid boosters for older adults,Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"April 18, 2023, 1:26 PM UTC / Updated April 19, 2023, 9:12 PM UTC",Coronavirus,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday backed a second dose of the updated Covid boosters for older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The recommendation is in line with the stance of the Food and Drug Administration, which authorized the additional dose Tuesday. Those 65 and older can get second doses of the updated versions of Pfizer-BioNTech’s and Moderna’s Covid boosters at least four months after their last doses, the FDA said in a statement. Most people who are immunocompromised can get additional doses at least two months after their last doses, according to the agency. The CDC's advisory panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, met earlier Wednesday to discuss the changes authorized by the FDA. The CDC signoff means shots could begin immediately. Following the FDA's decision, the CDC also recommended using the bivalent formula in all Covid vaccines moving forward, and it is doing away with the multidose primary series for people who haven’t yet been vaccinated. That means people who haven’t been vaccinated yet would need to get only single doses of the updated vaccines for the primary series. The booster shots were reformulated in August to target the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants, in addition to the original strain of the coronavirus. BA.4 and BA.5 are no longer in circulation in the U.S. As of Saturday, roughly 78% of new U.S. Covid cases are caused by the omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, according to the CDC. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, said that while the boosters don’t match the currently circulating strain, they should still provide some protection. A CDC report published in January found that the updated Covid boosters reduced the risk of Covid infection from the XBB.1.5 subvariant by nearly half. Another study, published by Israeli researchers in the Lancet this month, found that the Covid boosters reduced the risk of hospitalization in people 65 and older by 72%. Neither study, however, looked at the effects of getting two doses of the bivalent boosters. ""To date, regardless of the circulating variant, the vaccines continue to provide meaningful protection against severe manifestations of the virus, such as hospitalizations and death,"" Bogoch said. Uptake of the boosters has been low, with only around 17% of the total U.S. population having received one, according to the CDC. An advisory committee to the FDA raised doubts in January about moving to yearly Covid boosters for most adults and children but appeared to be supportive of multiple doses for the most at-risk people, like older people or people with weakened immune systems. It's not yet known whether younger adults and children will be allowed to get additional doses of the omicron shots, but FDA officials have said they plan to convene an advisory committee this summer to discuss what the Covid booster campaign might look like in the fall.

California and other Western states see spikes in unhealthy air pollution as national levels improve,Aria Bendix,"April 19, 2023, 4:01 AM UTC",Health news,"Fewer people in the U.S. are breathing unhealthy air now than a few years ago, but California and other Western states are seeing more dramatic short-term spikes in air pollution, according to a report the American Lung Association released Wednesday. From 2019 to 2021, nearly 120 million people — around 36% of the U.S. — lived in a place with unhealthy levels of air pollution, the group’s “State of the Air” report found. That's down from 137 million people from a prior three-year period, 2018 to 2020. But pollution from events like wildfires has gotten worse, particularly in Western states. “This year’s report has the highest number of people affected by short-term particles that we’ve ever seen in the history of the report,” said Katherine Pruitt, the report’s author and national senior director for policy at the American Lung Association. From 2019 to 2021, close to a half-million more people lived in counties with unhealthy spikes in daily particle pollution compared to the 2018-20 period, the report found. Particle pollution refers to a mixture of tiny pollutants from sources like factories, power plants, vehicles, wildfires and fireplaces. It's one of two types of air pollution the report measured, using data from the Environmental Protection Agency. The other, ozone smog, is a result of chemical reactions between pollutants from vehicles, factories or other industrial activities in the presence of sunlight. The report scored air quality in cities and counties based on their average levels of ozone smog, as well as short-term and year-round particle pollution. Wildfires were largely responsible for the short-term spikes, according to Richard Peltier, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved in the report. “We’ve made great strides across the United States to improve our air quality, but we’re still getting pinched by these external effects like wildfires that are related to climate change,” he said.

DACA recipients await Biden rule that would grant them access to affordable health care,Nicole Acevedo,"April 18, 2023, 11:00 PM UTC",Immigration Reform,"When Paloma Bouhid began working as a concierge at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida seven years ago, it was the first time she received health care insurance. But the lifeline she found through her job unexpectedly slipped away in 2020, when at 26 she lost her job during a round of mass layoffs. “The first thing I thought of is, ‘Oh my gosh, I don’t have a job’ and then you very quickly realize that also means I’m not insured,” Bouhid, whose family immigrated from Brazil to Tampa in 1999, said. Bouhid is one of the nearly 580,000 young adults without legal status who have been in the U.S. since they were children and are working or studying under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. An overwhelming majority were born in Mexico and other Latin American countries. DACA recipients like Bouhid are barred from accessing federally funded health insurance, but that may change soon: The administration of President Joe Biden is finalizing a proposed rule that would allow them access to it. Since bouncing back by starting a small business specializing in organization and decluttering in early 2021, Bouhid struggles with making $500 monthly payments toward her private health insurance, calling it “absolutely unaffordable.” “Knowing now that I have this opportunity to have affordable health care, it definitely takes a weight off my shoulders,"" Bouhid said. The DACA program has helped many eligible young immigrants access better paying jobs and educational opportunities, often enabling them to feel secure in their ability to seek and afford health care services, according to Roberto Gonzales, a professor of sociology and education at the University of Pennsylvania who has been tracking the lives of more than 400 DACA recipients since the program was implemented in 2012. ""But not all DACA beneficiaries have been able to access employment or educational opportunities that allowed them to receive health care benefits,"" Gonzales said. About a third of DACA recipients — an estimated 34% — don't have health insurance coverage, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. ""As a result, they were limited to local clinics with long wait times and emergency rooms as the primary sources of health care,"" Gonzales said. ""This meant that, oftentimes, illness and injuries were not treated in a timely manner."" ""For some DACA beneficiaries we met, this led to a worsening of conditions,"" he added. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Department of Health and Human Services submitted a proposed rule on Thursday that would amend the definition of “lawful presence” to include DACA recipients, for purposes of Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage. The agency said the proposed rule will be published in the Federal Register by the end of the month to give the public an opportunity to submit comments before the rules are finalized. ""If it gets finalized, I would definitely take advantage,"" Gretel Rodríguez, a 22-year-old DACA recipient from New Jersey, said. ""I have been in this country since I was a 4-year-old, but I haven't had decent access to health care."" Universities often require students like Rodríguez and Katia Rubio Leal to have health insurance at the time of enrollment. The requirement forced both of them to start paying expensive premiums that barely cover any of their needs, both women said. ""Let's say I'm in the gym, and an injury happens, that's when it's accessible,"" Rodríguez, who was born in Honduras, said about her health insurance, adding it doesn't cover her eye exams, the eye glasses she wears or medical check ups for her asthma. She has to pay for those services out of pocket. Rubio Leal, a 21-year-old DACA recipient, also recalled spending over $2,000 for limited health insurance coverage during her first year of college at Rockhurst University at Kansas City, Missouri — an amount that by her junior year had become unsustainable, she said. By the time Rodríguez goes to law school after she graduates from Rutgers University in May, DACA beneficiaries like her ""could see their health care access improve markedly"" if the rule is finalized, Gonzales said. ""They could access a primary care provider, which would allow them to be more proactive in managing their health and to seek medical interventions for specific ailments,"" he said. ""It would immediately lead to better health outcomes."" For Rubio Leal, who was born in Mexico and raised in Arkansas, being able to access federally funded health insurance as she pursues a degree in biomedical engineering would be a huge improvement. As a child who lacked insurance coverage, Rubio Leal recalled an instance her parents repaid a dentist with food for performing emergency dental work they couldn't afford. ""I would just want to be able to go to sleep at night knowing that my health is in check. And if it's not, that I can easily get help for it,"" Rubio Leal said. She aspires to pursue a doctorate's degree, with the ultimate goal of improving how prosthetic limbs are built and expand their accessibility. DACA recipients contribute an estimated $6.2 billion in federal taxes every year, already pouring funds into the federal health insurance programs they may soon have access to. Teissy Angel Ramirez, 28, was born in Mexico and raised in California. She moved to Nevada three years ago to care for her mother after being diagnosed with abdominal cancer. She currently works as a phlebotomist while also completing an associate of arts degree at the College of Southern Nevada with hopes of transferring to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to study public policy. Angel Ramirez has been working in the medical field since she was 18, starting as a caregiver for autistic patients at a mental and behavioral health center and later one for elder and disabled patients. The jobs have provided her with health insurance coverage, since she lacks options for affordable insurance due to her immigration status. Angel Ramirez's goal is to work in public policy and advocacy advancing immigrant and human rights. Having expanded access to affordable health care would mean not having to choose between her dream career and health care access. ""We can't forget there are still individuals that do not have the health insurance,"" she said. Gonzales added that while health care expansion to DACA recipients ""would be an important step forward, especially for the most vulnerable,"" he emphasized that DACA ""is a temporary and partial program that does not lead to citizenship and could very well be terminated."" While the program has been around for a decade, it has faced legal challenges from the previous administration and Republican-led states. DACA has been closed to new registrants since July 2021 while a lawsuit filed by Texas and other GOP-led states makes its way through the courts. To improve the chances that DACA will survive legal battles, the Biden administration implemented a rule in October that turned the program into a federal regulation. A federal judge in Texas is expected to rule on the legality of the new rule this year. ""What DACA beneficiaries need more than anything is a permanent solution,"" Gonzales said. For ""Dreamers"" like Rodríguez, that permanent solution is a pathway to citizenship for them and all undocumented immigrants. ""That's the main goal,"" she said. ""That's how I stay grounded in my activism."" "
"Up to 1 in 4 students misuse ADHD drugs, study finds",Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"April 18, 2023, 5:04 PM UTC",Health news,"More students from middle school to high school are misusing ADHD prescription drugs, amid an increasing number of children being diagnosed with the condition in the United States, a study published Tuesday finds. At some schools, as many as 1 in 4 students reported misusing drugs for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the previous year — meaning they used the medications without a doctor’s prescription or for nonmedical reasons, according to the study in JAMA Network Open. “The findings should be a major wake-up call,” said the study’s lead author, Sean McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan’s School of Nursing. Prescription stimulants are safe and effective when used appropriately. The medications “help millions of people” with ADHD, McCabe said, “but it is important to balance the need for access to the medications while reducing the risk for misuse.” The study’s findings were based on survey results from more than 231,000 students in eighth, 10th and 12th grades across more than 3,200 public and private schools in the U.S. The researchers looked at survey data from 2005 to 2020. Rates of misuse were the highest in schools that had the highest rates of students being treated for ADHD. Schools surveyed in more recent years — from 2015 to 2020 — had higher rates of misuse than those surveyed in earlier years. The drugs included in the survey were amphetamine, methylphenidate, Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta, Metadate, Dexedrine, Focalin and Vyvanse. The researchers found that students in schools with the highest rates of ADHD prescriptions had a 36% higher risk of misusing the stimulants. Middle school students were more likely to report misuse of the medications compared to high school students. Schools with high or moderate rates of binge drinking also had higher rates of misuse. In addition, the researchers found that schools with more white students or whose students’ parents had a higher level of education also had higher levels of misuse than those with fewer white students and whose parents had lower levels of education. Dr. Robert Bassett, the associate medical director of the Poison Control Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said that there is a misperception that prescription stimulants can “help garner an advantage and help improve academic performance or memory or stamina.” “In environments or households that place a high value on academic performance, there may be unintended stressors or pressures that could result in seeking an advantage by using stimulants,” said Bassett, who was not involved in the new research. But stimulants are not always benign medications. “Long term, they have a variety of effects in the body, not the least of which is cardiovascular problems like increased heart rate or blood pressure and increase the risk of neuropsychiatric complications too,” he said. Dr. Sam Wang, an emergency medicine physician and pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Colorado, who was not involved in the study, noted that misusing these types of medications has been found to be associated with a risk of substance abuse disorder and lower graduation rates. Others say that the problem could get worse in the coming years. Misuse of stimulants could become more common as children face rising rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders, said Dr. Nusheen Ameenuddin, a pediatrician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the study. “I think the tendency to self-medicate has likely increased,” she said. McCabe, the study’s author, said that because the students were self-surveyed, there is a chance some either misclassified or underreported their substance use. The study also didn’t include students who were home-schooled, dropped out or were absent on the day the surveys were taken. McCabe said parents of children with ADHD should talk to them about how to properly manage their medication, including talking with them about what to do if someone else asks to use their prescription. “It’s important to intervene while kids are still looking at these as medications rather than drugs of misuse,” he said.

Anti-abortion coalition asks Supreme Court to allow restrictions on abortion pill,Lawrence Hurley,"April 18, 2023, 4:09 PM UTC / Updated April 18, 2023, 4:37 PM UTC",Abortion Rights,"WASHINGTON — An anti-abortion coalition urged the Supreme Court on Tuesday to leave in place a lower court decision that would prevent patients from obtaining the abortion pill mifepristone by mail amid other new restrictions. The groups, led by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, said in a filing that the court should leave in place a ruling last week by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that would suspend several regulatory decisions by the Food and Drug Administration since 2016 that made it easier to obtain the drug. Lawyers for the groups wrote that the FDA over decades has ""stripped away every meaningful and necessary safeguard on chemical abortion, demonstrating callous disregard for women’s well-being, unborn life, and statutory limits."" “The lower courts’ meticulous decisions do not second-guess the agency’s scientific determinations; they merely require the agency to follow the law,” the lawyers added. They also dismissed the government's ""sky-is-falling argument"" about the implications of allowing the lower court ruling to go into effect. While the FDA has warned of regulatory chaos, the anti-abortion coalition's lawyers say older regulations dating to 2011 could immediately go into effect if the Supreme Court rejects the government's request. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, put the appeals court ruling on hold Friday while the justices consider what next steps to take. The court is set to act by midnight Wednesday. The Justice Department and Danco Laboratories, which makes the brand version of mifepristone, Mifeprex, had asked the high court to immediately step in and block the lower court ruling. To win, the Biden administration would need the votes of at least five of the nine justices on the court, which last summer in a 5-4 ruling overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which said women nationwide have the right to obtain abortions. The new case raises different legal issues about the FDA’s process for approving drugs, but it will nevertheless test the court’s pledge last year that it would leave abortion policy to the states and the federal government. The appeals court had somewhat narrowed the scope of an even broader ruling issued April 7 by Texas-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. The 5th Circuit declined to suspend the original FDA approval of mifepristone in 2000, as Kacsmaryk had ruled, which would have made distributing it unlawful. But the appeals court allowed separate elements of Kacsmaryk’s decision to remain in place. If those parts go into effect, the FDA’s decision in 2021 to allow mifepristone to be distributed by mail would be suspended, as would the 2019 decision that approved a generic version of mifepristone, which is made by GenBioPro. The FDA’s 2016 changes reduced the number of in-person visits patients are required to make from three to one and allowed the pills to be prescribed to women at up to 10 weeks’ gestation instead of up to seven weeks. The appeals court concluded that the challengers had waited too long to contest the 2000 approval in court. But the court found the claims against the 2016 revisions and later decisions could be pursued. The court also found that a hitherto obscure 19th century law called the Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of any drug or medicine that can be used for abortion, factors into its analysis of the 2021 decision to allow mifepristone to be distributed by mail. A federal judge in Washington state added a further wrinkle by issuing a preliminary injunction in a different case barring the FDA from “altering the status quo and rights as it relates to the availability of mifepristone.” That ruling, also issued April 7, applies only to 17 liberal-leaning states and Washington, D.C., which sued in February challenging the FDA’s regulations over the drug. Both lower court rulings in the Texas case have attracted strong criticism from various quarters, including the pharmaceutical industry. In a brief filed at the Supreme Court, the trade group PhRMA said that if the logic of Kacsmaryk’s ruling were applied to other drugs, it would upend the “settled regulatory framework and the investments that hinge upon it.” Kacsmaryk’s decision was the first since the FDA was created almost a century ago in which “any court had nullified an FDA approval by second-guessing a safety-and-effectiveness determination,” the brief said. A different drug, misoprostol, can be used alone for abortions, but experts have said it is not as effective in terminating pregnancies as it is when it is administered in tandem with mifepristone. A majority of abortions in the U.S. are carried out using pills, according to a survey conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade, some conservative states have enacted tough abortion restrictions that already make it difficult, if not impossible, to terminate pregnancies, whether by accessing pills or undergoing surgical procedures. Abortion is effectively banned altogether in 12 states, according to Guttmacher. "
"mRNA vaccine for melanoma reduces relapse after therapy, trial finds",Linda Carroll,"April 16, 2023, 3:01 PM UTC / Updated April 17, 2023, 2:02 PM UTC",Cancer,"In 2019, Gary Keblish got a diagnosis from his surgeon that left him stunned. The flat, dark-brown mole he’d had on his back for as long as he could remember had turned into a melanoma that was already advanced, putting him at risk of dying. “I felt numb,” the Brooklyn teacher, 61, said in an interview. Fortunately, Keblish was able sign on for a small clinical trial testing a preventive vaccine that might possibly keep the disease from coming back. The trial focused on a personalized vaccine using mRNA technology that used mutations to target mutations unique to a patient’s cancer but not the healthy cells in the body. All participants in the trial would receive the immunotherapy drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab), the standard of care for high-risk melanoma patients like Keblish. Two-thirds of the participants would also receive the vaccine. Keblish was one of those who received the vaccine — which teaches the body’s immune system to recognize cancer cells as different from normal cells so that, working along with the immunotheraoy drug, it can attack them. After two years, Keblish's cancer hasn't returned. On Sunday, the results of the phase 2 trial, which showed that the combination of the vaccine and immunotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by nearly half, were presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. It's the first randomized, controlled trial to show a benefit from this type of cancer vaccine, said senior investigator Dr. Jeffrey Weber, a deputy director of NYU Langone’s Perlmutter Cancer Center and a professor of medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. To test the effectiveness of the vaccine, the international team of researchers recruited 157 melanoma patients whose tumors had been surgically removed and who were at high risk of experiencing a recurrence of their cancers. Fifty patients received only the immunotherapy medication and 107 also got the personalized vaccination. One of the ways cancer evades the immune system is to fool the body into thinking the threat is over, at which point the natural braking system that prevents the immune system from staying constantly on kicks in. Weber compares the way pembrolizumab works to cutting a stuck brake cable on a car so it can go forward. Once the system’s braking system has been partially disabled, “the immune system works really well,” Weber said, adding that the downside of “cutting brake cable” is that the immune system stays turned up and some people end up with inflammation and something that resembles an autoimmune disease. One other way cancer can avoid being destroyed is through mutations, so the immune system’s soldiers cease to recognize it as a threat. That’s where the personalized mRNA vaccine comes in. After a patient’s tumor is removed, doctors identify proteins that are specific to that person’s tumor and no other cells in the body. As many as 34 proteins from a patient’s tumor were then the target of the vaccine. In the trial, 40% of the patients who received only the immunotherapy drug had a recurrence of their cancer during the two-year follow-up. In comparison, 22.4% of patients who got the drug plus the vaccine had a recurrence, leading to a difference of 44% between the two groups. The new findings are significant, said Dr. Antoni Ribas, a professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and director of Tumor Immunology Program at UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. It’s the first time a cancer vaccine has been shown to have this level of benefit, close to a 50% decrease in the risk of relapse,” said Ribas. “It tells us these vaccines actually work and can turn on an immune response against the patient’s own cancer."" The trial’s results are “very exciting,” said Dr. Thomas Marron, director of the Early Phase Trials Unit at the Tisch Cancer Institute  and an associate professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “Once the tumor is removed, we know it can come back because tiny microscopic bits have traveled elsewhere in the body and set up shop there,” Marron said. The recurrence often appears quickly, between six months and two years, he said. The beauty of the vaccine in this study is that it targets up to 34 mutations, Marron said. “That’s like taking 34 shots on goal,"" he said. You’re teaching the immune system to recognize 34 different things that are unique to that cancer.” The researchers anticipate the phase 3 trial, scheduled to launch this summer, to show similar results. With follow-up and monitoring, it could be at least two years before data is registered with the Food and Drug Administration and up to three years before the vaccine combination would be approved for use in patients, Weber said. Still, it's an exciting advance in the field of cancer vaccines, particularly for stopping melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, experts said. The study is “important because it’s the first randomized study of a cancer vaccine with a clinically meaningful endpoint: stopping tumors from coming back,” said Dr. Margaret Callahan, research director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Immunotherapeutics Program, who expressed cautious optimism about the findings. “This is an exciting advance in the field of cancer vaccines, an area notoriously tough to make progress in,” Callahan said.

"HPV can cause numerous kinds of cancer, yet many people don't realize it",Benjamin Ryan,"April 17, 2023, 12:40 PM UTC",Cancer,"A majority of Americans are unaware that HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., can cause a number of major cancers, a new study found. Researchers were surprised over one finding in particular: a decline in awareness that HPV, human papillomavirus, is linked to cervical cancer. Nearly all sexually active women and men become infected with HPV at some point, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to CDC estimates, currently more than 42 million Americans carry at least one strain of HPV. About 13 million people are infected each year. In the new study, which will be presented Tuesday at the American Association for Cancer Research’s annual meeting, researchers analyzed nationally representative survey data collected by the Health Information National Trends Survey that monitored U.S. adults’ knowledge about the virus’s connection to cancer. There were about 2,000 to 2,300 annual respondents to the survey, including for 2014 and yearly from 2017 to 2020. They found that about two-thirds of respondents consistently had heard of HPV. Of that group in 2020, 70.2% were aware of the link between the virus and cervical cancer, a significant 7.4% drop from 77.6% in 2014. “That was very shocking for us,” said lead author of the study Eric Adjei Boakye, an assistant scientist at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, of the falloff. Only about 30% of the people who knew about HPV also knew it could cause throat or anal cancers. Not all types of HPV are dangerous. Most infections don’t have symptoms and go away on their own within a couple of years. But in some cases, the infection persists and can lead to cancer. About 47,000 people are diagnosed with HPV-linked malignancies annually, including cervical, anal, vulval, oropharyngeal (back of the throat), vaginal and penile cancer, according to the CDC. Cervical cancer is the most prevalent, with 13,800 cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed yearly in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. Precancerous cervical cells are diagnosed far more often. The new findings come amid a surge of vaccine skepticism and a decline in child vaccination in the U.S. There’s long been resistance to the HPV vaccine, which was first approved in 2006 for girls and young women to prevent cervical cancer. It has since been updated to prevent anal, oral and head and neck cancer in men and women. Much of the hesitation about the HPV vaccine is tied to fears about safety and a belief among a “substantial fraction of parents"" that the vaccine isn’t necessary, a recent study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found. Some parents have resisted having their children vaccinated for HPV out of concern that it would encourage sexual risk taking. A 2018 study, however, found no association between state laws pertaining to HPV vaccination and school attendance and sexual behaviors in teens. “One of the reasons why the vaccination rate is low is the fact that people are not aware that it actually prevents cancer,” said Adjei Boakye. “So there has been a lot of talk about trying to improve people’s awareness level.” Pre- and early-adolescent boys and girls have been the targeted group for receiving the HPV vaccine, although it has recently been cleared for people up to age 45. “If we had nearly full vaccination rates, we could essentially eliminate these cancers, which would be spectacular,” said Dr. William L. Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society. The current version of the vaccine prevents nine strains of HPV that are known to cause cancer. Adjei Boakye and his coauthors speculate that the drop in awareness about HPV and cervical cancer may have been driven by efforts to educate doctors about recommending the HPV vaccine, rather than campaigns to educate the public. He also theorized that online misinformation may be partially to blame. Despite persistent worries about safety, a study that reviewed Gardasil, the leading HPV vaccine, nine years following its approval, found no serious associated health outcomes after 178 million doses had been given worldwide. “It might be one of the safest vaccinations we’ve ever had,” said Dahut. Research suggests the HPV vaccine has already had a dramatic public health impact.  In the mid-2000s, 11.5% of teenage girls carried at least one of the four HPV strains. That figure plunged to 1.8% a decade later, according to the CDC. A recent study found a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the HPV vaccine. Various states have laws requiring HPV vaccination for adolescents’ school attendance, including Hawaii, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington, D.C. California legislators recently proposed requiring all students entering the eighth grade to receive the vaccine. People who are already sexually active may still benefit from the vaccine, research suggests. Even if they have already contracted one or more of the cancer-linked strains, the vaccine may still prevent such individuals from contracting other strains, and thus could still mitigate their overall cancer risk. During routine gynecological exams, doctors can look for cancerous or precancerous cells on the cervix through a Pap test. Left untreated, precancerous cells may progress to cancer. Adjei Boakye emphasized that HPV vaccination is particularly vital as prevention for oral, penile and anal cancers, since there is no standard, recommended screening for early detection when the diseases are easier to treat. “It’s always really shocking that people still think they don’t need it,” he said of the vaccine. “It’s a human thing, they think they will never get cancer.” "
Adults with Down syndrome face a health care system that often treats them as kids,"Tony Leys, KFF Health News","April 16, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Health news,"MONTROSE, Mo. — It took Samantha Lesmeister’s family four months to find a medical professional who could see that she was struggling with something more than her Down syndrome. The young woman, known as Sammee, had become unusually sad and lethargic after falling in the shower and hitting her head. She lost her limited ability to speak, stopped laughing, and no longer wanted to leave the house. General-practice doctors and a neurologist said such mental deterioration was typical for a person with Down syndrome entering adulthood, recalled her mother, Marilyn Lesmeister. They said nothing could be done. The family didn’t buy it. Marilyn researched online and learned the University of Kansas Health System has a special medical clinic for adults with Down syndrome. Most other Down syndrome programs nationwide focus on children, even though many people with the condition now live into middle age and often develop health problems typically associated with seniors. And most of the clinics that focus on adults are in urban areas, making access difficult for many rural patients. The clinic Marilyn found is in Kansas City, Kansas, 80 miles northwest of the family’s cattle farm in central Missouri. She made an appointment for her daughter and drove up. The program’s leader, nurse practitioner Moya Peterson, carefully examined Sammee Lesmeister and ordered more tests. “She reassured me that, ‘Mom, you’re right. Something’s wrong with your daughter,’” Marilyn Lesmeister said. With the help of a second neurologist, Peterson determined Sammee Lesmeister had suffered a traumatic brain injury when she hit her head. Since that diagnosis about nine years ago, she has regained much of her strength and spirit with the help of therapy and steady support. Sammee, 26, can again speak a few words, including “hi,” “bye,” and “love you.” She smiles and laughs. She likes to go out into her rural community, where she helps choose meals at restaurants, attends horse-riding sessions at a stable, and folds linens at a nursing home. Without Peterson’s insight and encouragement, the family likely would have given up on Sammee’s recovery. “She probably would have continued to wither within herself,” her mother said. “I think she would have been a stay-at-home person and a recluse.” The Lesmeisters wish Peterson’s program wasn’t such a rarity. A directory published by the Global Down Syndrome Foundation lists just 15 medical programs nationwide that are housed outside of children’s hospitals and that accept Down syndrome patients who are 30 or older. The United States had about three times as many adults with the condition by 2016 as it did in 1970. That’s mainly because children born with it are no longer denied lifesaving care, including surgeries to correct birth defects. Adults with Down syndrome often develop chronic health problems, such as severe sleep apnea, digestive disorders, thyroid conditions, and obesity. Many develop Alzheimer’s disease in middle age. Researchers suspect this is related to extra copies of genes that cause overproduction of proteins, which build up in the brain. “Taking care of kids is a whole different ballgame from taking care of adults,” said Peterson, the University of Kansas nurse practitioner. Sammee Lesmeister is an example of the trend toward longer life spans. If she’d been born two generations ago, she probably would have died in childhood. She had a hole in a wall of her heart, as do about half of babies with Down syndrome. Surgeons can repair those dangerous defects, but in the past, doctors advised most families to forgo the operations, or said the children didn’t qualify. Many people with Down syndrome also were denied care for serious breathing issues, digestive problems, or other chronic conditions. People with disabilities were often institutionalized. Many were sterilized without their consent. Such mistreatment eased from the 1960s into the 1980s, as people with disabilities stood up for their rights, medical ethics progressed, and courts declared it illegal to withhold care. “Those landmark rulings sealed the deal: Children with Down syndrome have the right to the same lifesaving treatment that any other child would deserve,” said Brian Skotko, a Harvard University medical geneticist who leads Massachusetts General Hospital’s Down Syndrome Program. The median life expectancy for a baby born in the U.S. with Down syndrome jumped from about 4 years in 1950 to 58 years in the 2010s, according to a recent report from Skotko and other researchers. In 1950, fewer than 50,000 Americans were living with Down syndrome. By 2017, that number topped 217,000, including tens of thousands of people in middle age or beyond. The population is expected to continue growing, the report says. A few thousand pregnant women a year now choose abortions after learning they’re carrying fetuses with Down syndrome. But those reductions are offset by the increasing number of women becoming pregnant in their late 30s or 40s, when they are more likely to give birth to a baby with Down syndrome. Skotko said the medical system has not kept up with the extraordinary increase in the number of adults with Down syndrome. Many medical students learn about the condition only while training to treat pediatric patients, he said. Few patients can travel to specialized clinics like Skotko’s program in Boston. To help those who can’t, he founded an online service, Down Syndrome Clinic to You, which helps families and medical practitioners understand the complications and possible treatments. Charlotte Woodward, who has Down syndrome, is a prominent advocate for improved care. She counts herself among the tens of thousands of adults with the condition who likely would have died years ago without proper treatment. Woodward, 33, of Fairfax, Virginia, had four heart surgeries as a child and then a heart transplant in her 20s. Woodward, who is an education program associate for the National Down Syndrome Society, has campaigned to end discrimination against people with disabilities who need organ transplants. She said her primary care doctor is excellent. But she has felt treated like a child by other health care providers, who have spoken to her parents instead of to her during appointments. She said many general-practice doctors seem to have little knowledge about adults with Down syndrome. “That’s something that should change,” she said. “It shouldn’t just be pediatricians that are aware of these things.” Woodward said adults with the condition should not be expected to seek care at programs housed in children’s hospitals. She said the country should set up more specialized clinics and finance more research into health problems that affect people with disabilities as they age. “This is really an issue of civil rights,” she said. Advocates and clinicians say it’s crucial for health care providers to communicate as much as possible with patients who have disabilities. That can lead to long appointments, said Brian Chicoine, a family practice physician who leads the Adult Down Syndrome Center of Advocate Aurora Health in Park Ridge, Illinois, near Chicago. “It’s very important to us that we include the individuals with Down syndrome in their care,” he said. “If you’re doing that, you have to take your time. You have to explain things. You have to let them process. You have to let them answer. All of that takes more time.” Time costs money, which Peterson believes is why many hospital systems don’t set up specialized clinics like the ones she and Chicoine run. Peterson’s methodical approach was evident as she saw new patients on a recent afternoon at her Kansas City clinic. She often spends an hour on each initial appointment, speaking directly to patients and giving them a chance to share their thoughts, even if their vocabularies are limited. Her patients that day included Christopher Yeo, 44, who lives 100 miles away in the small town of Hartford, Kansas. Yeo had become unable to swallow solid food, and he’d lost 45 pounds over about 1½ years. He complained to his mother, Mandi Nance, that something “tickled” in his chest. During his exam, he lifted his shirt for Peterson, revealing the scar where he’d had heart surgery as a baby. He grimaced, pointed to his chest, and repeatedly said the word “gas.” Peterson looked Yeo in the eye as she asked him and his mother about his discomfort. The nurse practitioner takes seriously any such complaints from her patients. “If they say it hurts, I listen,” she said. “They’re not going to tell you about it until it hurts bad.” Yeo’s mother had taken him to a cardiologist and other specialists, but none had determined what was wrong. Peterson asked numerous questions. When does Yeo’s discomfort seem to crop up? Could it be related to what he eats? How is his sleep? What are his stools like? After his appointment, Peterson referred Yeo to a cardiologist who specializes in adults with congenital heart problems. She ordered a swallowing test, in which Yeo would drink a special liquid that appears on scans as it goes down. And she recommended a test for Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that interferes with digestion and is common in people with Down syndrome. No one had previously told Nance about the risk. Nance, who is a registered nurse, said afterward that she has no idea what the future holds for their family. But she was struck by the patience and attention Peterson and other clinic staff members gave to her son. Such treatment is rare, she said. “I feel like it’s a godsend. I do,” she said. “I feel like it’s an answered prayer.” Peterson serves as the primary care provider for some of her patients with Down syndrome. But for many others, especially those who live far away, she is someone to consult when complications arise. That’s how the Lesmeisters use her clinic. Mom Marilyn is optimistic Sammee can live a fulfilling life in their community for years to come. “Some people have said I need to put her in a home. And I’m like, ‘What do you mean?’ And they say, ‘You know ― a home,’” she said. “I’m like, ‘She’s in a home. Our home.’” Sammee’s sister, who lives in Texas, has agreed to take her in when their parents become too old to care for her. Marilyn’s voice cracked with emotion as she expressed her gratitude for the help they have received and her hopes for Sammee’s future. “I just want her to be taken care of and loved like I love her,” she said. “I want her to be taken care of like a person, and not a condition.” KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

"Indiana plastics fire spewed toxic chemicals, EPA tests find, including benzene and hydrogen cyanide",Aria Bendix,"April 14, 2023, 10:05 PM UTC",U.S. news,"A plastics fire in Indiana spewed various toxic chemicals into the air, including hydrogen cyanide and benzene, according to test results from the Environmental Protection Agency. Officials said Friday that air monitors detected hydrogen cyanide, benzene, chlorine, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds in the ground-level smoke. “We detected some new contaminants right at the incident command post, which is, again, at the center of the evacuation zone,"" Jason Sewell, the EPA's on-scene coordinator, said at a news conference in Richmond, Indiana. ""The two new contaminants we detected were hydrogen cyanide and benzene. We had not detected those before last night. The fire department jumped on extinguishing the hot spot and that abated,"" he said. The EPA said it notified the Richmond Fire Department that it had detected the two dangerous compounds out of concern for firefighters’ safety. The blaze was first reported on Tuesday afternoon, and soon after, the Wayne County Emergency Management Agency told residents within half a mile to evacuate. That order is still in place. The warehouse where the fire started contained large amounts of shredded and bulk recycled plastic, and it sent ominous black smoke over Richmond and surrounding towns in eastern Indiana and western Ohio. Local and federal officials warned area residents on Wednesday that smoke from burning plastic could contain cancer-causing toxins. Hydrogen cyanide, a highly toxic gas, can be fatal depending on the dose and length of exposure. Benzene is known to cause cancers such as leukemia, multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in some people with long-term exposure. The World Health Organization has said there’s no safe level of benzene exposure when it comes to cancer risk. “What we don’t know is the levels and where did they measure them?” said Dr. Arthur Frank, an environmental and occupational health professor at Drexel University. Christine Stinson, executive director of Wayne County Health Department, said her analysts need time to go over the test results from both air and water samples to understand the long-term health threats people living near the fire site could face. ""We certainly are going to get that information out to the public — what are the risks you have been exposed to if you didn’t honor that evacuation zone,"" she said, adding, ""I don't want to frighten anybody, but this was a plastics fire. There was particulate matter up in the air."" The EPA said Thursday that it also found asbestos in samples of debris that fell in surrounding neighborhoods up to 1.5 miles from the fire. Asbestos can cause several types of cancer, including mesothelioma and lung, laryngeal and ovarian cancer. No amount of exposure is considered safe, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Frank said the fire may have spewed additional chemicals that the EPA has not tested for yet. By Friday afternoon, no flames or smoke were visible, but firefighters will remain at the scene this weekend in case any hot spots reignite, city officials said. “Stay away from the site,” Richmond fire chief Tim Brown said in a news conference. “Let us take care of it, let us take care of the flare ups and everyone will be safe.” Environmental health experts said they worry that acute exposure to the chemicals  the EPA has identified so far could lead to breathing problems in the short term or cancer in the long term. “If you think back 20 years ago to the World Trade Center, remember that stuff there burned for days and smoke was coming up and we’re still seeing now disease from people who worked on that pile. This has got a lot of the same stuff,” Frank said. Andrea De Vizcaya Ruiz, an associate professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of California, Irvine, said that judging by the size of the plume, ""this is not something that is going to disperse in a short period."" ""It’s going to take a long time for those concentrations to come down,"" she said. Area residents have been instructed not to touch debris that has landed in their yards, and especially not use lawnmowers, which could kick up dangerous material and make it easy to inhale. Ash debris from the fire was all over the farm of Lynn Childers in New Paris, Ohio, 6 miles away. Childers told NBC News on Thursday that he felt irritation in his throat and nose. ""My throat was burning,"" he said. ""I didn't pay any attention to it because I didn't know the severity."" "
Abortion pill legal fight heads toward Supreme Court showdown,Lawrence Hurley,"April 13, 2023, 4:55 AM UTC / Updated April 13, 2023, 10:13 PM UTC",Abortion Rights,"A federal appeals court decision that declined to suspend approval of the abortion pill mifepristone but kept in place restrictions that would prevent it from being sent to patients by mail has teed up a high-stakes showdown at the Supreme Court. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday that the Justice Department “strongly disagrees” with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to allow the restrictions and will seek immediate Supreme Court review. The decision late Wednesday by the New Orleans-based appeals court leaves considerable uncertainty over access to the drug. The Biden administration would need to win the votes of at least five of the nine justices on the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. The appeals court granted the Justice Department's emergency request to put on hold part of U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's decision last week that suspended the Food and Drug Administration's original approval of mifepristone, which dates to 2000. But the three-judge panel said a separate part of Kacsmaryk's decision, which suspends changes the FDA made to the drug's approved use in 2016, could go into effect. The panel also determined that the FDA's finding in 2021 that mifepristone can be distributed by mail should be put on hold, as well as the 2019 decision that approved a generic version of mifepristone made by GenBioPro. The court's decision imperils widespread availability of the drug, as it would require patients to make in-person visits to obtain it. The 2016 changes, among other things, reduced the number of in-person visits patients are required to make from three to one and allowed the pills to be prescribed to women at up to 10 weeks' gestation instead of up to seven weeks. Erin Hawley, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group that represents the challengers, said in a statement that the appeals court’s decision to allow new restrictions was “a significant victory for the doctors we represent, women’s health, and every American who deserves an accountable federal government acting within the bounds of the law.” Abortion rights groups assailed the appeals court for failing to block Kacsmaryk's ruling in full. ""Anti-choice extremists want to ban all abortion, everywhere. They can’t win elections, so they’ve turned to the courts to do their dirty work,"" Mini Timmaraju, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling last summer, overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion. The new case raises different legal issues about the FDA’s process for approving drugs, but it will nevertheless put to the test the court’s pledge last year that it would leave abortion policy to the states and the federal government. The appeals court panel was divided 2-1, with Judges Kurt Engelhardt and Andrew Oldham, both appointees of President Donald Trump, in the majority. Judge Catharina Haynes, an appointee of President George W. Bush, said she would have temporarily blocked the ruling in full. The appeals court concluded that the challengers had waited too long to challenge the 2000 approval. But, the court found, the claims against the 2016 revisions and later decisions could be pursued because the government and drugmaker Danco Laboratories ""have not shown that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their timely challenges."" The court also found that a hitherto obscure 19th century law called the Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of any drug or medicine that can be used for abortion, factors into its analysis of the 2021 decision to allow mifepristone to be distributed by mail. The Biden administration and Danco, the maker of Mifeprex, the brand version of mifepristone, are seeking to block Kacsmaryk’s ruling in full. Complicating the situation further, a federal judge in Washington state issued a preliminary injunction in a different case last week barring the FDA from “altering the status quo and rights as it relates to the availability of mifepristone.” The ruling applies only to the 17 liberal-leaning states and the District of Columbia that filed a lawsuit in February challenging the FDA’s regulations over the drug. At the request of the Justice Department, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rice in Washington state clarified in an order Thursday that the FDA cannot make any moves to comply with the 5th Circuit's decision in the states affected by the case before him. His order made clear the direct conflict between the rulings, which is likely to factor into the Supreme Court's consideration of the issue. While misoprostol can be used alone for abortions, experts have said it is not as effective at terminating pregnancies as it is in tandem with mifepristone. A majority of abortions in the U.S. are carried out using pills, according to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. "
"Richard Engel’s son died of Rett syndrome. His cells may help find a cure, his doctor says.","Maura Hohman, TODAY","April 13, 2023, 9:01 PM UTC",Health news,"The son of NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel, Henry Engel, died eight months ago at age 6 — but he’s still at the center of the research that will hopefully prevent other children from losing their lives to the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. Henry’s physician, Dr. Huda Zoghbi, discovered the genetic cause of Rett syndrome and, years later, she found that Henry had a one-of-a-kind mutation to the gene that causes the syndrome. She believes Henry’s cells could be the key to finding a cure for the illness, which causes “severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the child’s life: their ability to speak, walk, eat, and even breathe easily,” according to the International Rett Syndrome Foundation. “Our Rett syndrome research will continue to push as hard as possible to develop treatments. This is how we will honor Henry’s life,” Zoghbi said at a recent event honoring Henry at the Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, where she serves as director. Henry’s cells could also advance research for other neurological conditions, such as autism, Zoghbi said in a ""TODAY"" segment that aired on Thursday. She recalled that losing Henry was “one of the hardest days” for her and her research team. “We all cried,” she said. Zoghbi met Henry within his first year of life, after Engel and his wife, Mary, noticed their son wasn’t reaching usual motor milestones — the first sign of Rett syndrome for many children, according to the foundation. After sequencing was performed on Henry, it was discovered that he had a mutation to the gene involved in Rett syndrome. The Engels got in touch with Zoghbi, who’s been researching the disease for many years. “He has this smile that he looks at you — you’ll see it in the pictures posted on the web — and naturally, you fall in love with him,” she told ""TODAY."" “And you see him — how he’s struggling to really do the best he can so he can move, so he can gain some strength to crawl or do something.” “You feel the pain of Rett syndrome, and I felt that pain with so many patients before him,” she continued. “You see a child who is helpless and who is sweet, and he’s connecting with you, but he really is suffering from this disease. Your heart goes out, and you want to do everything possible.” When Zoghbi uncovered that Henry was the first person observed to have his particular mutation to the MECP2 gene, she needed to do more research, so she recommended Henry be seen at Texas Children’s Hospital, where doctors could treat and track his symptoms to see if they followed the usual path for Rett syndrome. MECP2 is found on the X chromosome, according to the National Institutes of Health, which females have two of, so it’s even rarer and more severe in males because they only have one X chromosome, explained Zoghbi. Males are more likely to die from the illness. “When we first met Henry ... he couldn’t stand steady. He had a tremor. He would shake a little bit,” she recalled. “He couldn’t speak, but he was young. He had a lot of different weaknesses in his motor system.” She added that Henry’s parents “worked so hard” to help him, doing physical and occupational therapy with him every day and advocating for research in hopes that it could save their son and thousands of others. “It was really amazing watching them work as a team,” Zoghbi said. “One of the visits, I was so excited because he did say, ‘Dada.’ That was a word we heard from him.” Due to the pandemic and the Engels being based in the U.K., she didn’t see Henry for two years prior to his death. But she was aware that his condition started to worsen a few months ago “in spite of the heroic effort his parents were doing with him,” she said. “That’s the nature of this disease.” Zoghbi attributes in part to his parents the fact that Henry lived longer than most boys with the disease. “[They] really worked very hard to protect him and give him physical therapy so that he could be as functional as possible,” she said, adding that many boys with Rett syndrome die by age 2. Another standout moment from her time with Henry was one of his birthdays. “I got some books, and the smiles I got from him — he was happy,” she said. “He must have recognized everybody was celebrating him and everybody’s excited about it. He was so happy and active. That’s really my last memory during his last visit.” “This is the memory I’ll always hold dear because he reacted to the books we gave him and the toys. It was fun. ... It was a special time.” As a geneticist and researcher, Zoghbi also values the moment when Henry met her team of students and scientists researching a cure for Rett syndrome. Currently, there isn’t one, and treatment addresses symptoms of the syndrome, not its cause, according to NIH. “When they’re working in the lab, they’re always thinking about him,” she said. Because of Henry’s unique mutation, Zoghbi’s team is using Henry’s cells in ongoing research. By studying Henry’s cells several years ago, she learned that Henry’s mutation affected the function of the MECP2 gene in such a way that it caused an important protein for brain development to be produced at lower levels. “That inspired us to start thinking of different ways we can increase the protein that’s made by this gene,” Zoghbi explained. “So if it’s not functioning at 100% capacity — maybe it’s functioning at 40% capacity — maybe if we can increase the amount of the protein, maybe that will get us to help some of the symptoms.” “[Henry] became a driving force in the lab because the lab members met him and knew him and played with him,” she added. “This kind of relationship is very important because it reminds everybody in the lab that there are human beings at the end of the road who are waiting and may one day benefit from this work.” “Henry helped us make a very strong connection,” she continued. “You just can’t help it. His sweet smile, he’s so good. He just will smile and light up your day.” But research takes time, and Zoghbi said she’s “heartbroken” that she and her team weren’t able to bring to the table something that could help Henry directly. Many of the people who work in the lab were also devastated by Henry’s passing, but they were quick to tell Zoghbi, “We’re going to continue to work. We’re so close. That’s what we have to do,” she recalled. While Henry’s cells are still being used in her research, Zoghbi stressed that she’s learned so much from so many Rett syndrome patients on her path to find a cure. “I love all of them,” she said. “I worked 16 years to find the (MECP2) gene. I care about all of them.” And Henry could still help Zoghbi give these patients and their families what they’ve been waiting for. “Studying [Henry’s] cells helped us to think a little differently, to find yet one more approach for developing therapies for Rett,” she said. “If we’re successful, that can help so many patients. That would be a dream. That would be [Henry’s] legacy.” "
"'Succession' finally has a winner, but that was never the point",Daniel Arkin,"May 29, 2023, 3:41 AM UTC",Culture & Trends,"The following article contains major spoilers about the series finale of HBO's ""Succession."" When all was said and done, Shiv Roy lived up to her name in spectacular fashion. The final episode of the HBO tragicomedy ""Succession"" culminated with perhaps the most stunning betrayal in the show's four-season run: Shiv (Sarah Snook), who had vowed to back her older brother Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and block the sale of their late father's media empire, pulled a last-minute 180. In an emotional confrontation that devolved into a brawl, Shiv sided with the buyer, Nordic tech bro Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård), and helped install her estranged husband, Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen), as the new CEO of Waystar Royco. The final shot: Kendall, bleary-eyed and gutted, solemnly staring out at the rolling waves off Manhattan — adrift in nearly every sense of the term. Shiv, brutally iced out of the CEO gig and always working the angles, ultimately decided to throw in her lot with her spouse, a sycophantic ""empty suit"" (her words!) who all but offered himself up to Matsson as a feckless puppet. The final minutes of the finale show Shiv and Tom in the back of a chauffeured SUV, blankly staring ahead and not quite holding hands. She's pregnant with their child. Best of luck to the happy couple. Meanwhile, the acid-tongued middle sibling, Roman (Kieran Culkin), skulked away from the boardroom fireworks to lick his wounds over a cocktail and finally get a respite from the Oedipal drama. The eldest Roy child, the eccentric failed presidential candidate Connor (Alan Ruck), cleared out his father’s vast penthouse apartment. It seemed clear enough that neither scion will go on to future business success. "
Berlin police investigate Pink Floyd rocker Roger Waters over Nazi-style costume worn during concert,Minyvonne Burke,"May 27, 2023, 3:50 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Roger Waters, a founder of the band Pink Floyd, is under investigation by Berlin police after he wore a Nazi-style costume during a recent concert in the German capital. In a video posted on social media, the 79-year-old musician is seen on stage dressed in a long black trench coat with bright red armbands as he fired a fake machine gun into the crowd. The person who shared the video accused Waters of ""imitating a Nazi."" Waters said in a Facebook statement that the part of his show being criticized was meant to be ""a statement in opposition to fascism, injustice, and bigotry in all its forms."" ""Attempts to portray those elements as something else are disingenuous and politically motivated,"" he wrote. Waters is being investigated on suspicion of ""incitement of the people,"" police in Berlin said. His costume at last week's show in Berlin was ""deemed capable of violating the dignity of the victims, as well as approving, glorifying or justifying the violent and arbitrary rule of the Nazi regime in a way that disrupts public peace,"" a police spokesperson said. Waters has worn the costume at other shows, including one in Madrid, and similar costumes were featured in the 1982 movie ""Pink Floyd: The Wall."" He said the ""depiction of an unhinged fascist demagogue has been a feature"" at his shows since ""The Wall."" ""I have spent my entire life speaking out against authoritarianism and oppression wherever I see it. When I was a child after the war, the name of Anne Frank was often spoken in our house, she became a permanent reminder of what happens when fascism is left unchecked. My parents fought the Nazis in World War II, with my father paying the ultimate price,"" he wrote in his Facebook statement. Waters said regardless of the consequences, he will ""continue to condemn injustice and all those who perpetrate it."" Other German cities including Munich, Frankfurt and Cologne tried to cancel Waters’ concerts after Jewish groups including the Central Council of Jews accused him of anti-Semitism. More than 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Olympiahalle ahead of his May 21 concert holding signs in support of Israel and opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to The Algemeiner. Waters is a member of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement that targets Israel over its occupation of territories where Palestinians seek statehood. He denied the accusations and the efforts to stop the concerts were unsuccessful. The final German tour date at Frankfurt’s Festhalle venue on Sunday is still listed on Waters’ website. "
"Actually, Black mermaids have been part of mythology for a long time",Uwa Ede-Osifo,"May 26, 2023, 2:09 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"When Halle Bailey was cast in the live-action remake of “The Little Mermaid,” some critics blasted the decision, proclaiming Princess Ariel could not possibly be Black. But one professor who studies the mythology of mermaids and the present-day communities that portray them says that view couldn’t be further from the truth. Yes, mermaids are mythological creatures, but their African origins are real according to Jalondra Davis, an assistant professor of English at the University of California, Riverside. And some mermaids are Black. Part of Davis’ research situates the origin of Black mermaids during the Middle Passage, a time period where Africans were enslaved and violently transported across the ocean to North America and the Caribbean. A common motif of mermaid legends is that enslaved people who went overboard transformed into water creatures along with their descendants. In African cosmologies, “people who were lost to the water could become water spirits,” Davis said. “Water spirits could take people into the water and keep them alive.” So, history informs myth. Still, according to Davis, because Black popular culture can be overly concentrated on historical dramas, it’s important that there is access for Black stories that cover a range of experiences including fantasy that is not tied to fact or reality. “The Little Mermaid” is led by a Black actor, but Bailey’s race is not the point. “People often feel like when they’re watching something with Black people or reading something with Black people that they need to learn something,” Davis said. “We don’t have to represent history; we could be anything.” After a trailer of “The Little Mermaid” was released, aside from the vitriol, videos went viral of young Black girls thrilled to see a Disney princess with a complexion that matched their own. “It’s important because it can open up possibilities for the things we can create and the possibilities for our children in terms of thinking about what they can do in the world and what they can create,” Davis said. A pillar of the Black mermaid community is “aquatic diversity,” she said, and “teaching Black children to swim” to ensure their safety. Among Black Americans, especially children, swimming proficiency rates are low, largely owing to segregation-era policies that denied nonwhite people access to pools and beaches. Davis began swim lessons in 2020 as she connected with mermaiding, a process she views as restorative in the strenuous relationship between Black history and water. There are also mermaid cosplayers — people who perform being a mermaid through costumes — who usually don a clothed monofin, which places both feet together in a single fin, to mimic the mermaid tail before they swim underwater. Davis cautioned though that swimming under these conditions can be physically arduous. Others are drawn to mermaid cosplaying because of its gender inclusivity: Having a mermaid tail can be a way to say “who cares” about the latter region of one’s body. “Water becomes a refuge,” she said. “The water becomes a site of possibility for another life.” Similar to the fictional African utopia Wakanda in “Black Panther,” Davis said that Black mermaid lore is a “way to look at the kind of worlds and societies that African people might have created without any disruption.” “The water belongs to us,” Davis said.

Taylor Swift's collaboration with Ice Spice raises eyebrows amid Matty Healy backlash,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 25, 2023, 11:36 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Some of Taylor Swift’s Black fans have renewed their frustration over the singer’s connection to The 1975 frontman Matty Healy after Swift announced a collaboration with rapper Ice Spice. While fans were excited about the remixed “Midnights” track featuring Ice Spice, who will be the first Black woman on one of Swift’s songs, some questioned Swift’s motives. Earlier this year, Healy engaged in behavior some deemed racist, including laughing at and joining in on jokes mocking Ice Spice while appearing as a guest on a podcast. And while Healy and Swift have not confirmed a romantic relationship, the two have made headlines after being spotted out together. Healy has also been photographed at several of the Eras Tour concerts. Given that connection, Swift’s collaboration with Ice Spice seemed like a calculated PR move, some said. Others said they believe the Ice Spice collaboration was likely long in the works, but they remained disappointed by the fact that Swift has yet to address Healy’s previous comments. “I don’t believe that Matty Healy is a demon conservative,” said Brooke Giles, 27, who considers herself a die-hard Swiftie. “And she [Swift] is not commenting on it. Instead, she’s finding more ways again to profit off of controversy.” Representatives for the three artists did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Healy made the controversial comments on a February episode of the podcast “The Adam Friedland Show.” During the episode, Healy, who is white, can be heard laughing at jokes that hosts Friedland and Nick Mullen make about Ice Spice’s ethnicity (Ice  Spice is Dominican and Nigerian). He also appeared to encourage the co-hosts when they imitated Chinese and Hawaiian accents, and, later, laughed when the two imitated Japanese accents. The podcast episode was pulled from Apple and Spotify. In April, Healy apologized for his comments, addressing Ice Spice directly while performing in Auckland, New Zealand. “I never meant to hurt anybody,” he said. “I’m sorry if I’ve offended you and, like, Ice Spice, I’m sorry. It’s not because I’m annoyed that me joking got misconstrued, it’s cause I don’t want Ice Spice to think I’m a d—. I love you, Ice Spice. I’m so sorry. I don’t want anything to be misconstrued as mean. I don’t mind being a bit of a joker … but I don’t want to be perceived as, like, kind of mean-hearted.” Healy, Swift and Ice Spice have not weighed in on the controversy. In her announcement on Wednesday, Swift said she is a “massive fan” of Ice Spice, adding “after getting to know her I can confirm: she is THE ONE to watch.” “Sweetest person ever thank u sm,” Ice Spice wrote in her response tweet. Ice Spice had previously shared her love of The 1975 in a Jan. 25 video interview with Elle. Discussions surrounding Swift and Healy have pervaded social media for days. “i love taylor swift as much as the next swiftie but this is such an interesting PR move,” wrote another Twitter user. Fans have used the hashtag #SpeakUpNow to share their frustrations over Swift’s association with Healy. The tag was also used in a fan-written letter which was widely ""liked"" and shared on Twitter. “Your voice holds tremendous power and right now your silence is palpable,” the fan wrote. “We urge you to reflect on the impact of your own and your associates’ behavior and engage in genuine self-reflection.” Swift fans like Mike Mason, 24, said they are still angered by Healy’s comments. “When I saw the comments, I was honestly so disgusted and angry,” Mason said in an email to NBC News. “It was completely racist and uncalled for, and I don’t think his apology was genuine at all.” It was completely racist and uncalled for. -Mike Mason, taylor swift fan, on comments matty healy made during a february podcast appearance Amid the discourse, some Swifties have come to Healy’s defense, noting that he previously advocated for progressive causes and women’s issues. Comedian and activist Franchesca Ramsey suggested the defense of Healy could be due to the parasocial relationship — the attachment that fans may feel toward a public figure, especially personable people who are very active online — people have with Swift. The artist is known for intentionally leaving clues of all kinds in her music videos, lyrics and social media for her devoted fans to analyze and dissect. ”my take is a large percentage of Taylor’s audience feels extreme loyalty to her bc of the parasocial relationship she’s cultivated with them throughout her career,” Ramsey tweeted. “showing allegiance to her on social media is a way to feign closeness & a chance at being picked/noticed by her.” Some said they believe the controversy serves as an example of Swift’s privilege and participation in white-centric feminism. “I don’t think she’s a terrible, awful person,” Giles said. “I always like to think that is pretty well-established. But I do think that she’s very careless in her privilege.” Others expressed disappointment that the controversy has overshadowed Ice Spice. Ava Brown, 24, said as a longtime Swift fan, said she finds the Healy discourse “frustrating.” “... a lot of people are defending the things that he says in a way that’s like, ‘Oh, he was just making a joke,’ or ‘Oh, it’s performance art,’” she said. But Brown, who recently attended an Eras Tour concert, said to some degree the discourse around Healy is annoying because it detracts from the fun of Swift’s music. “I’m just a fan of Taylor Swift,” she said. “I don’t know what he said that was right or wrong or any of that. I think part of what’s become frustrating is that I just want to listen to her music, and I just want to be a fan.” "
"Eva Longoria calls out a double standard in Hollywood: White men can fail, but Latinas can’t",Variety,"May 23, 2023, 8:04 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Eva Longoria put Hollywood on notice during her Kering Women in Motion talk at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. The “Desperate Housewives” alum, who was joined by University of Southern California Annenberg professor and researcher Dr. Stacy L. Smith, is making her feature directorial debut with “Flamin’ Hot,” an inspirational story about a Frito-Lay janitor who invented Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. The film won an audience award at the SXSW Film Festival. As a female director, a first-time director and a Latina director, Longoria said she “felt the weight of my community” and “the weight of every female director” when production started on “Flamin’ Hot.” “We don’t get a lot of bites at the apple,” Longoria said about Latina directors. “My movie wasn’t low budget by any means — it wasn’t $100 million, but it wasn’t $2 million. When was the last Latina-directed studio film? It was like 20 years ago. We can’t get a movie every 20 years.” Longoria continued, “The problem is if this movie fails, people go, ‘Oh Latino stories don’t work … female directors really don’t cut it.’ We don’t get a lot of at-bats. A white male can direct a $200 million film, fail and get another one. That’s the problem. I get one at-bat, one chance, work twice as hard, twice as fast, twice as cheap,” Longoria said. With “Flamin’ Hot,” Longoria was adamant on making an inspirational story about Latinos with characters who resembled her own family, from her father to her uncles. The story looks at how corporate America underestimates the Hispanic community. The same can be said for Hollywood studios, Longoria observed. “Twenty-eight percent of ticket buyers at the box office are Latino,” she said. “Your film will not succeed if you don’t have the Latino audience. Do you know how many Latinos showed up for ‘Crazy Rich Asians’? Do you know how many Latinos bought a ticket for ‘Fast and the Furious’? We over-index at moviegoing, so why shouldn’t there be content for us if we are the ticket buyers?” Even with the strides that have been made with Latino inclusion in Hollywood, Longoria says that not only is there a long way to go, but, statistically, the industry is moving backward. “We’re still underrepresented in front of the camera, we’re still underrepresented behind the camera, we’re still not tapping into the females of the Latino community,” Longoria said. “We were at 7% in TV and film, now we’re at 5%, so the myth that Hollywood is so progressive is a myth when you look at the data.” "
‘Mother and Child’ director Rodrigo Garcia wraps first Spanish-language feature for Netflix,Variety,"May 22, 2023, 7:46 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Colombian-Mexican filmmaker Rodrigo García has wrapped his first Spanish-language feature, “Familia,” which was shot in Valle de Guadalupe, Mexico for Netflix. García, who has directed such acclaimed films as “Mother and Child” and “Albert Nobbs,” and whose TV credits include “Six Feet Under,” “Big Love” and “In Treatment,” said: “Shooting ‘Familia’ has been a great experience.” He added: “Great producers, collaborators, several of my favorite Mexican actors and actresses and Netflix’s full support have made this project an unforgettable trip back home.” This is the first time García, who is the son of Colombian Nobel Laureate Gabriel García Marquez, has directed a film in Mexico. He’s an executive producer in Netflix’s upcoming adaptation of his father’s literary classic “100 Years of Solitude,” which will be shooting in Colombia. According to the synopsis, “Familia” follows “a peculiar family and explores the complexities of cohabitation around a decision that will change them forever.” “In a world where distance seems to pull us apart, ‘Familia’ shows the power of togetherness,” it continued. The stellar cast includes Daniel Giménez Cacho (“Bardo: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths”), Ilse Salas (“The Good Girls”), Cassandra Ciangherotti (“Ready to Mingle”), Natalia Solian (“Huesera: The Bone Woman”) and Spain’s Maribel Verdú (“Pan’s Labyrinth”). Gerardo Gatica (“Museo,” “I’m No Longer Here”) founder of Mexico City-based Panorama Global, serves as producer. His company is also known for the sports drama “Cassandro,” starring Gael Garcia Bernal, which premiered this year at Sundance Festival to an upbeat reaction. It also has the Hulu TV series “La Maquina” now in post. Expressing his delight at Netflix’s first collaboration with García, Francisco Ramos, VP of content for Latin America, said: “‘Familia’ is a film about the importance of family ties, which led Rodrigo to film in Mexico for the first time. It carries on our firm commitment to #QueMéxicoSeVea.” “I expect this to be the first of many collaborations with Rodrigo,” he added. The #QueMéxicoSeVea initiative, which means “Let Mexico be seen,” is Netflix’s $300 million-over-three-years commitment to Mexican cinema and series. Last year, it announced a host of new projects, including the directorial debut of Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (“Brokeback Mountain,” “The Irishman”) who has begun production on the adaptation of Juan Rulfo’s seminal novel, “Pedro Paramo.” “The impact of our productions has been very positive so far: We are hyper-committed to Mexican cinema,” said Ramos last year, adding: “Mexicans love our content and there is a huge appetite for Mexican cinema in Latin America and in some parts of Europe as well,” adding that they are working with some of the biggest players in Mexico, including Redrum, Woo Films, Alebrije Prods. and Pimienta Films.

Max-Brown posted a sponsored TikTok on Thursday in support of Bioré's campaign for Mental Health Awareness Month. In the video, she shared her experience with anxiety after going into lockdown on campus during the shooting at Michigan State University in February. She also showed off a box of Bioré pore strips and encouraged viewers to ""get it all out, not only what's in your pores but most importantly what's on your mind, too."" ""I found myself recently struggling from seeing the effects of gun violence firsthand,"" Max-Brown said in the video. ""I've had to intentionally set aside time for prioritizing my mental health. I will never forget the feeling of terror that I had walking around campus for weeks in a place I considered home."" Max-Brown graduated from Michigan State University last month and previously spoke about the shooting in another TikTok in February. The partnership video went viral on TikTok and Twitter, sparking backlash from viewers. ""That Biore team deserves all the fire it’s about to catch for that ad because WHY are y’all running paid social using a school shooting survivor referencing said shooting as talking points in an ad for PORE STRIPS???"" one person tweeted. ""These brand partnerships have gone too far. Biore teaming up with a mass shooting victim to “get it all out” is crazy,"" another tweeted. ""This is so dystopian,"" one Twitter user said. The TikTok has been taken down from Max-Brown's account. In an email to NBC News on Friday, Max-Brown said the TikTok ""came off completely wrong."" ""I wanted the message to shed light on how I've been struggling with anxiety after our school shooting,"" she said. ""My only intention was to try and help other people that are going through the same experience, and not desensitize what happened."" Max-Brown also posted an apology on her TikTok page on Sunday echoing this sentiment. “This partnership was not intending to come off as the product fixing the struggles I've [had] since this event,"" she said. ""Rather partnering with a brand to spread awareness of what me and so many other students have been dealing with."" The video was part of Bioré’s “Strip Away the Stigma” challenge, which aims to normalize conversations about mental health. The challenge is a part of the company's ongoing ""Get That S--- Out"" campaign, its mental health initiative that launched in 2021. ""Our consumers have told us that mental health is one of their biggest priorities, and it is so important for us to be able to provide meaningful support to them around this issue,"" said a Bioré spokesperson in an email. ""This time, however, we did it the wrong way. We promoted one of our influencer’s stories in the campaign and the promotion of that content was insensitive. We are so sorry."" In a previous statement sent to NBC News, which was also posted to Instagram, Bioré also said: “We lacked sensitivity around an incredibly serious tragedy, and our tonality was completely inappropriate.” The spokesperson said the company would continue to support mental health initiatives moving forward.

In an opinion piece for Chalkbeat published Thursday, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, David Banks, outlined the school system's plans to engage with ChatGPT, a chatbot created by artificial intelligence company OpenAI, and similar tools. He said the ban was put in place ""due to potential misuse and concerns raised by educators in our schools."" However, he wrote, ""the knee-jerk fear and risk overlooked the potential of generative AI to support students and teachers, as well as the reality that our students are participating in and will work in a world where understanding generative AI is crucial."" Banks said officials held discussions with tech industry leaders ""about their platforms’ potential and the future possibilities for schools, educators, and students."" They also ""consulted our most trusted experts — citywide educators, many of whom had already started teaching about the future and ethics of AI."" “While initial caution was justified, it has now evolved into an exploration and careful examination of this new technology’s power and risks,” he wrote. Going forward, Banks said educators will be provided with ""resources and real-life examples of successful AI implementation in schools to improve administrative tasks, communication, and teaching."" They will also offer ""a toolkit of resources for educators to use as they initiate discussions and lessons about AI in their classrooms."" When asked for a statement, a spokesperson for New York City’s Department of Education referred NBC News to the chancellor’s op-ed. Manhattan Borough President Mark D. Levine praised the decision to drop the ban, calling it “absolutely the right move” in a tweet. ""We need to prepare our young people for the new world that’s coming,"" he tweeted. Although chatbots are not a new technology, ChatGPT exploded on social media in late 2022 after some declared the bot was a better search engine than Google thanks to its conversational speaking style and coherent, topical response style. After its viral launch, ChatGPT was lauded online by some as a dramatic step forward for AI and the potential future of web search. But with such praise also came concern about its potential use in academic settings. Use of AI in educational settings continues to stir discourse online. This week, Texas A&M University–Commerce said it is investigating after a screenshot of an instructor’s email — in which he accused students of having used AI on their final assignments — went viral on Reddit. Many blasted him, and others came to his defense, noting that AI is still a very new tool. In classrooms, AI technology is already being used to help detect plagiarism. Many students have long used computer-assisted writing tools, such as Grammarly or Google Docs’ Smart Compose. Platforms like Grammarly and Chegg also offer plagiarism-checking tools. In April, Turnitin, a plagiarism detection service, announced it will activate its AI writing detection capabilities to “help educators and academic institutions identify AI-generated text in student-written submissions.” A spokesperson for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Fans are encouraging others online to have better etiquette at concerts,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 18, 2023, 5:56 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Ginger Sherry is familiar with mosh pits. As an avid concertgoer, she knows that sometimes party fouls — like spilling beer on someone — will happen. But at shows these days, Sherry, 25, has noticed what appears to be a vibe shift among fellow concertgoers. She’s seen things like excessive pushing outside of the pit, which can lead to crowd crushes, and people in crowds throwing things. “I feel like there’s a lot of new people post-Covid, and I feel like, in general, people just don’t know concert etiquette anymore,” Sherry said. Across social media, Sherry and others have increasingly been sharing anecdotes about their latest experiences at some of their favorite artists’ shows. Some have said they’ve witnessed rude interactions between fans or been shamed by other concertgoers for behaviors like screaming lyrics or dancing. Others said they feel that the concert environment can feel competitive, with fans forgoing social norms. The recent influx in perceived bad behavior led Sherry to make a TikTok advising others on how the should behave when they’re in a concert setting and some best practices — like not bringing beer into the mosh pit. “I wanted to make a video about, like, what is proper concert etiquette and like being in a mosh pit and how to be respectful,” Sherry said. “Crowd energy is very contagious … People can get out of hand and people also act differently when they’re with other people.” The conversation around concert etiquette has ramped up as artists like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé embark on wildly popular tours. Some concertgoers who spoke with NBC News suggested the bad behavior stems from some fans’ desire to compete with others for the best video or the closest spot in the crowd. Better video means a better chance of going viral, and with social media in its own video-forward era, it can sometimes feel like every phone is out, which can create an obstructed view. Others said they believe the pandemic took a toll on people’s social skills and behavior. “Going to pre-pandemic concerts, I just felt like everyone knew how to act, and concerts felt like this really safe space for people to kind of share, shared love of music with each other,” said TikToker Hannah Hawthorne, 27, who made a video about concert etiquette best practices. “When I went to a concert for the first time after the pandemic, it was such a stark difference … it was like everyone didn’t know how to act.” Erin Dihn was on the receiving end of a rude interaction at a concert that she said left her “gutted.” After waiting months to see Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, she finally made it to a March show in Glendale, Arizona. Dihn, 27, a disabled U.S. Navy veteran, said she was experiencing respiratory issues, so she had to be wheelchaired into the venue by a member of the arena’s staff. The crowd entering the venue was “packed like sardines,” which gave Dihn an opportunity to compliment a nearby concertgoer in a sequin dress. “She just said, ‘Thanks. By the way, wheelchairs are for disabled people only’,” Dihn said. “I was very taken aback by that comment.” She later made several videos to share her experiences at The Eras Tour, both the good and the bad moments. In one of her videos, she responded to another Eras Tour concertgoer. That person had recorded someone who was seated during the show. It appeared the person recording was making fun of the seated person. “Honestly, it doesn’t even matter the reason she was sitting,"" Dihn said in her response. ""You don’t need to film her and try to shame her on TikTok just because she’s sitting at a concert."" David Thomas, a professor of forensic studies at Florida Gulf Coast University, said concert venues — like social media — allow for more anonymity, which gives people the ability to act on their worst impulses. Add intoxicants into the mix with attendees vying for the best video to post on social media, and the crowd becomes a bomb waiting to detonate. “A large crowd offers anonymity. So the things that you might be thinking that you wouldn’t normally do, that would be against normal social values, are exactly the opposite in the crowd,” said Thomas, a former police officer with an expertise in the psychology of crowds. “You kind of feel that you could disappear in that crowd, and it’s hard to point the finger at an individual.” There’s a balance of enjoying yourself and being obnoxious. — TikToker Hannah HawthornE Fans said they also believe concert etiquette goes hand in hand with safety. Sherry and others who spoke to NBC News pointed to events like the 2021 Astroworld festival — in which 10 people died — when emphasizing the importance of being conscientious of others in the crowd. “Safety is so important because you don’t want people to die at a concert that we’re just going to for fun,” Sherry said. Artists themselves have also been on the receiving end of bad behavior — crowd members have thrown items at artists like Harry Styles and Lady Gaga. In March 2022, rapper Tyler the Creator told fans during a concert to stop throwing items on stage. To Hawthorne, proper concert etiquette is all about balance. “I have heard conversations of people talking about, ‘Oh, everyone’s screaming the lyrics,’ but I mean, that’s everyone’s always screamed the lyrics at concerts,” she said. “There’s a balance of enjoying yourself and being obnoxious.” "
A Latino high schooler's hilarious coming of age inspires new streaming comedy 'Primo',Edwin Flores,"May 18, 2023, 12:25 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"The chaotic and relatable environment of a young Latino high school student as he grows up in a San Antonio home with his single mom and five uncles is the topic of a new coming-of-age comedy. ""Primo,"" which premieres Friday on Amazon’s free streaming service, Freevee, formerly IMDb TV, is based on the life of journalist and author Shea Serrano, 41. He's the author of bestselling pop culture and sports books, including “The Rap Year Book” and “Basketball (and Other Things)” — former President Barack Obama chose the latter as one of his favorite reads in 2017. Both books were turned into docuseries for AMC and Hulu. ""Primo"" follows Rafa, a young Mexican American high school student portrayed by Ignacio Diaz-Silverio, as he balances cultural norms, college aspirations, societal expectations and the hectic home life of being raised by his single mom, played by Christina Vidal, and his five uncles, all with very different lives and perspectives on manhood. Serrano, the first Mexican American to be a four-time New York Times bestselling writer, is one of ""Primo's"" showrunners and creators, alongside Mike Schur, known for his previous shows ""The Good Place"" and ""Parks and Rec""; Schur is also the series' producer. In a virtual interview, Serrano said that while the show is based on a Latino character, it's not about having “to say that the family is Latino.” “We were very aware of what we were wanting to do, and a lot of this stuff is, like, we don’t need to say every single thing; we just will exist, and it’ll be better that way,"" he said. Over the course of the show, Rafa experiences major life moments, such as nearing the end of high school, connecting with the young woman of his dreams and realizing he has a chance to become his family’s first person to go to college. And he gets plenty of advice and viewpoints from his family, especially his uncles. “I hope people, when they watch it, they just feel good and warm and demand 30 more seasons of it,"" said Serrano, who's also a screenwriter, podcaster and former teacher. “When we were writing the show, like, let’s just make it as specific as possible. And then let’s get a bunch of really talented people, make some room for them and let them go nuts."" Diaz-Silverio echoed Serrano in emphasizing the show's universal appeal. “I hope audiences don’t come to it with this expectation of, like, 'Oh, this is a show about a Hispanic family,' because I don’t think that’s what it’s about,” he said. “I don't think 'Primo' is about Hispanic people more than 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' is about Irish people. ... They just so happen to be that, and I actually think that’s, like — a really important step in the evolution of representation is to just exist as people on screen and not have to make something about an ethnic identity.” Serrano recently signed a television deal with Amazon Studios, the studio behind ""Primo,"" to develop an original and limited podcast series. He is also behind Netflix’s comedy series ""Neon,"" as well as ""Miguel Wants to Fight,"" his first feature film, which will premiere on Hulu this year. "
'Succession' sparks election anxiety online with latest episode,Daysia Tolentino,"May 15, 2023, 3:11 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"SPOILER ALERT: This article discusses the eighth episode of season four of ""Succession,"" which aired on HBO on Sunday. ""Succession"" fans on Sunday had one word to describe their viewing experience: triggering. ""America Decides,"" the eighth episode in the fourth season, was set in the fictional ATN newsroom during a close election night between far-right Republican nominee Jeryd Mencken and center-left Democratic nominee Daniel Jimenez. Without patriarch Logan Roy at the helm of Waystar Royco, the Roy siblings were calling the election night shots for the first time, navigating how to get ATN the most views — even if it meant airing misinformation and calling key swing state results early. The result? Chaos, anxiety and a whole lot of déjà vu for viewers, many whom had followed real election coverage from home for the last two cycles. “Jesse Armstrong you must pay for our therapy putting us through election PTSD how dare you,” one fan tweeted, calling out the ""Succession"" creator by name. “Watching election coverage, even for a fictional election, is triggering,” wrote one user. ""Me tuning into #Succession to be entertained but instead having to revisit the trauma of the past two elections & be confronted with the truth of the corrupt capitalist hellscape in which we live,"" another person tweeted. A pivotal plot point during the episode involved a firebombing of a Milwaukee polling center, which some swing state voters said particularly gave them anxiety. Wisconsin was called early by ATN, giving Mencken a big lead in the fictional race. ""as a Wisconsinite who stayed up until the wee hours in 2020 anxiously awaiting Milwaukee’s ballot count that episode of Succession was for real triggering,"" one person tweeted. The episode was also a tough watch for journalists, some who shared memories of their own newsroom experiences on stressful election nights. ""Good God. As a former journalist this episode of Succession is making me crazy,"" wrote one user. ""As a journalist, this #Succession election episode has me crumpled up into a ball,"" another user wrote. ""Tonight's 'Succession' is so triggering for anyone who has ever worked in a newsroom, had something go wrong during a busy news day/night, and had a manager who literally does not know how anything works run up to them and start freaking out as if that's going to help AT ALL,"" added another user. One ""Succession"" fan, a former journalist, said they usually like to rewatch episodes. But not this one. ""I usually watch each episode of @succession at least twice, often in one night,"" they wrote. ""But as a former TV journalist who covered 11 presidential elections and who knows how many state and local elections, I’m gonna need a night or two to recover."" "
Heather Armstrong’s friends remember the Dooce.com blogger’s complicated legacy,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"May 13, 2023, 1:00 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Since Heather Armstrong’s death, friends of the mommy blogger known as Dooce described her in vivid terms. She was a revolutionary and a pioneer, funny and witty, genuine and sharp, forever ingrained in the fabric of social media and internet culture. But they also recalled a woman who was sometimes beset with personal demons. On her blog, Armstrong had written frankly about depression and alcohol abuse, and in her final April post she touched on those struggles, describing her dependence on alcohol as an attempt to numb “22 years of agony.” One friend, Elizabeth, who asked that NBC News refer to her by only her first name to protect her identity so she could openly discuss her own sobriety, noticed their chats becoming more infrequent. They had once talked almost daily about their experiences with sobriety, faith and children. But now their conversations were punctuated by weeks or months. “I knew that she was going through something really hard,” Elizabeth said. “We were not talking every day, the way we were when she seemed like she was really thriving in recovery.” Elizabeth said their last conversation happened right after Elizabeth had given birth to her baby, who is now 3 months old. On the day Armstrong died, Elizabeth sent her one final message. “She was just on my mind a lot the day that she died, and I sent her a message telling her I was thinking about her and I loved her,” Elizabeth said. “And I knew that she was struggling.” Armstrong’s partner, Pete Ashdown, confirmed to the Associated Press on Wednesday that she had died by suicide. Armstrong launched Dooce in 2001 and cultivated a devoted following, chronicling painful experiences in bracingly confessional fashion. In the era of Instagram and TikTok, many “lifestyle influencers” try to sell their followers on an all-smiles, picture-perfect fantasy of modern domesticity. Armstrong, to be sure, lived in material comfort and enjoyed financial success, but she resisted the incentives to smooth over the prickly edges of her life. She wrote in stark terms about her experiences with postpartum depression, alcoholism and sobriety. In writing candidly about the darker dimensions of her day-to-day experiences, Armstrong stood in solidarity with other women, embodying a basic truth: the joys of motherhood are often inextricable from the physical pain and emotional struggle that comes with it. The “queen of the mommy bloggers” — an incomplete, vaguely condescending label for her work — saw her calling as wider in scope. “I want people with depression to feel like they are seen,” Armstrong told Vox in 2019. Aimee Giese, a fellow blogger, graphic designer and photographer, met Armstrong while attending conventions and conferences, where they struck up a friendship. Giese said the two would attend blogging conferences together in the early days of the internet. When Armstrong would come to Denver, where Giese lived, on a book tour, they would spend time together. But like many relationships, their friendship lived on thanks to the internet. Giese described Armstrong as not only a pioneer of parenting blogs but also as a writer with a sharp wit, who was genuinely funny and wrote laugh-out-loud content. After Armstrong’s death, Giese said she and her friends who had been among the original mommy bloggers echoed one phrase over and over again. “I would not have the career path that I have right now if it wasn’t for Heather Armstrong,” she said. With the attention came waves of online hate, which in 2015 drove a descent into depression and spurred Armstrong to take a break from blogging, Ashdown told The New York Times this week. Ashdown did not respond to a request for comment. At the time of Armstrong’s break from blogging, the online ecosystem had shifted away from blogs and toward new social media platforms that encouraged a different, more fragmented type of storytelling, and Armstrong said she no longer felt at home among her fellow bloggers. “In beginning, it was all mess,” she told The Cut in 2015. “People were craving honest stories about parenting. I think people are craving that again now, but bloggers are afraid to be that honest. Since blogging is so flush with money, the immediate thought is, is there going to be money in that?” Armstrong also grappled with drawing boundaries around aspects of her personal life that she didn’t want to share with her audience. She separated from her husband — the father of her two daughters — in 2012. And as her girls grew older, she told The Cut that she became wary of oversharing information about them on the internet. “Her oldest child and my child are almost exactly the same age, and right at the same time, they both kind of asked us to stop writing about them,” Giese said. “So all of the problems inherent in writing about your children on the internet, you know, we all went through it together.” The depression returned after Armstrong’s break from blogging. In 2017, she enrolled in an experimental treatment that required 10 rounds of being put into a chemically induced coma. She wrote about this experience in a book titled “The Valedictorian of Being Dead: The True Story of Dying Ten Times to Live,” which was published in 2019. Ashdown told the Times that Armstrong was disappointed the book didn't become a bestseller, and that she drowned those feelings in “drinking and drinking and drinking.” She got sober in 2021 when Ashdown gave her an ultimatum to quit drinking, he told the Times. But before her death, Armstrong had relapsed. Giese said in the last year or two of Armstrong’s life, many in the blogging community had begun to notice a change. In recent months, her writing had become erratic and somewhat incoherent. “She tried really hard to live and try different, sometimes extreme, things to survive,"" Giese said. ""I think the pressure led her down some places that were really dark. And some of us didn’t necessarily recognize her in the last year or two."" She tried really hard to live and try different, sometimes extreme, things to survive. -Aimee Giese, a fellow blogger who met Armstrong while at conventions and conferences. Armstrong’s impulse to put her most private feelings on display occasionally forced her readers to reckon with sentiments they might have found troubling. In a lengthy blog post published in August 2022, most notably, she expressed views some deemed transphobic. The post in which she wrote ""Biological gender is scientific"" and ""we are tossing around these pronouns like goddamn candy"" was later removed. But some fans remained disappointed; some said they stopped reading her blog. Alice Bradley, a writer, posted on Substack about her complicated friendship with Armstrong on Thursday. Bradley explained that she had a falling out with Armstrong but did not specify what led to the end of their friendship. Bradley declined to speak with NBC News  and instead directed a request for comment to her Substack. “Heather made me feel like I was in a sacred inner circle with her. I loved her, and I loved our little group of friends. We had so much fun,” she wrote. She recalled walking around with Armstrong at conferences as her eyes darted around the room, possibly a symptom of the large amount of hate she attracted online. “She focused too much on the hate, I thought; I wished she would notice all the love instead. But then I received a smattering of the kind of criticism that was directed her way and to say I didn’t take it well would be an understatement,” Bradley wrote, later noting that online hate and depression were a dangerous pairing. She said as good as it felt to be Armstrong’s friend, it could feel equally bad to be on the outside of her bubble. Bradley wrote that Armstrong could be “so talented, oh my god, so funny; her writing was so sharp. And yet. And yet. She could be awful.” After the falling out, “we were civil to each other, we checked in occasionally, but I distanced myself. She turned into someone I didn’t recognize,” Bradley wrote. “I worried from afar. She posted increasingly incoherent rants. I texted with my other blog friends about what was going on, did we need to get her help? Was she safe?” she wondered. While many friendships evolved out of the mommy blog circuit, some came from Armstrong’s reader base. Elizabeth had read Armstrong’s blog for years, but it was in April 2021, on a whim, that she decided to reach out. Armstrong had recently revealed that she was sober, and with 10 years of sobriety herself, Elizabeth offered support. “I said, ‘Hey, you know, I’ve got 10 years under my belt, but it’s a lonely walk right now because of the pandemic, and I have little kids. If you want a sober friend, here’s my number,’ which is something that in recovery people do,” Elizabeth said. Roughly six weeks later, Armstrong texted Elizabeth. From there, Armstrong and Elizabeth talked nearly every day for the next two years, Elizabeth recalled. Their friendship was “a weird little miracle,” Elizabeth said. Their conversations often centered on sobriety and spirituality. Elizabeth talked about her Episcopalian faith and Armstrong talked about finding faith after leaving Mormonism behind. They gave each other gifts in the form of playlists, which spoke to Armstrong’s affinity for music. (Giese also recalled exchanging playlists with Armstrong.) Elizabeth said that for her and the other mothers who read Dooce, Armstrong was the first person to show the more brutally honest side of being a parent. She said Armstrong explored the duality of raising kids while also wanting to go to music festivals, run marathons and take crazy trips. She taught a generation of parents what motherhood could look like, rather than the rigid confines of what motherhood had been, Elizabeth said. Armstrong’s creative sensibility — raw, sometimes raunchy, abidingly real — inspired others to unapologetically broadcast their lives on the web, a sensibility that is now practically expected of anyone who goes online. Yet that warts-and-all openness exacted a steep price on Armstrong’s mental health, as she recalled in the interview with Vox. She was vulnerable with her audience — and therefore vulnerable to a wave of hostility. “The hate was very, very scary and very, very hard to live through,” Armstrong recalled. “It gets inside your head and eats away at your brain. It became untenable.” If you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

"Meet 'Chonkosaurus,' the viral Chicago River snapping turtle",Brahmjot Kaur,"May 12, 2023, 7:53 PM UTC / Updated May 12, 2023, 8:33 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"A massive snapping turtle lounging on a bed of rusty chains in the Chicago River has won hearts on the internet after a viral video of the spectacle was posted to Twitter on Saturday. Joey Santore, a self-taught botanist and Chicago native, was kayaking through the Chicago River with his friend when he came across the turtle —  which he named Chonkosaurus. “We were just going to go out and survey for plant species that were popping up along the river, not anything that was planted, but what just pops up on its own in these highly disturbed and often polluted environments,” he said. “We started seeing a bunch of native species of turtle and were just checking out some of the animal life there.” While kayaking down the river, Santore and his friend spotted the reptile on a rotting pylon, which was held together with chains and historically used to direct water traffic and prevent damage to other structures in the water. That day, it was a spot for the turtle to relax. In the video, which had over 350,000 views on Twitter as of Friday afternoon, Santore offers Chonkosaurus words of encouragement. “You look good. I’m real proud of you. You’ve been eating healthy,” Santore said in the video. “You ever heard of liquid salad? We’ve been doing that.” Online users were mesmerized by Chonkosaurus’ size. “I love Chonkosaurus, our new Chicago icon!” one person commented. “you know, I don’t hear the old Chicago accent too much these days. this guy is a great example,” another user wrote on Twitter. “also love that our river is healthy enough to support this lovely beast!” “What has that thing been eating??? I’ve never seen tortoise phat before, what a delight. I’ve seen big ones tall as a dog up in the northeast but that’s a real chonker,” another commented. There are two species of snapping turtles in North America and both of them can be found in Illinois, according to the nonprofit Friends of the Chicago River. Snapping turtles are also “ill-tempered and capable of producing a very serious bite,” the nonprofit said. Phil Nicodemus, director of research at Urban Rivers, a nonprofit organization that focuses on transforming urban waterways into wildlife sanctuaries, said he’s seen the large snapping turtles nearby for the last few years. However, he said it was refreshing to see such public enthusiasm around the wildlife. “For someone to come down our canal, take this video and it goes so viral — that’s something that we see every day,"" he said. ""The people that live near us don’t even sometimes realize that stuff is right there. So, this is exactly what we wanted to see."" Nick Wesley, the executive director of Urban Rivers, said the snapping turtles thriving in the area is common as the healthy ecology continues to grow in the area. The growth in the area relied on the work of the nonprofit and others to undue the years of pollution in the river. “The river was historically terribly polluted. Sewage and shipping were the two main uses, but I think we’ve really turned the page since then,” he said. “Our focus has been on habitat and really increasing wildlife and that’s something that I think has been really lacking in our river system.” Santore said the size of Chonkosaurus was a shock, but so was the location where he spotted it. “This thing was obviously very ecologically successful here. It was thriving, and finding plenty to eat. I didn’t expect to see that so close to downtown Chicago. And there was another one there too,” he said. Santore, who makes educational YouTube videos about plants, said he didn’t expect the video to go viral, since his content is generally focused on plant education, but is grateful so many enjoyed the clip. “People are used to passing by plants at 70 miles per hour on the freeway. I’m used to people being pretty plant blind,"" he said. ""When you see a 60-pound snapping turtle that looks like a dinosaur hanging out on … those rusty pylons — I think the whole setting was just so funny.” This isn’t Santore’s first run in with virality. He went viral in 2019 for rescuing a coyote in the California countryside in a video where viewers were captivated by the coyote’s big eyes and Santore’s bold Chicago twang. "
Writers strike: What TV shows are being affected,Brahmjot Kaur,"May 9, 2023, 8:08 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Prepare for a potentially lackluster fall television schedule. With the first Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike in 15 years in full swing, the more immediate future of some of your favorite content hangs in the air. The strike began May 2 after six weeks of high-stakes negotiations between the WGA and the trade group Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Thousands of unionized scribes say they are not paid fairly in the streaming era.  (The WGA represents some of NBCUniversal’s news division employees. Comcast, the corporation that owns NBCUniversal, is represented by the trade group.) The strike has brought production on some broadcast programs and streaming shows to a virtual standstill, upending the entertainment industry. But viewers may not notice a difference in programming just yet, according to Oliver Mayer, a professor of dramatic writing at the University of Southern California School of Dramatic Arts. But that will likely change if the strike continues as expected premiere dates for shows or seasons come and go. “There’ll be a lot of reruns. There won’t be as much content,” Mayer, who is an emeritus member of the WGA, said. “It’s a matter of weeks, not months from now, that a good consumer of this material is going to notice the drought.” The late-night shows were the first to feel the impact. NBC’s “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “Late Night With Seth Meyers;” CBS’ “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert;” ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!;” and HBO’s “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” and “Real Time With Bill Maher” all went dark as soon as the strike commenced. “Saturday Night Live” on NBC also halted its 48th season. The show will air repeats for the foreseeable future, Variety reported. Actor and talk show host Drew Barrymore stepped down as host of the MTV Movie & TV Awards show, which aired Sunday. “I have listened to the writers, and in order to truly respect them, I will pivot from hosting the MTV Movie & TV Awards live in solidarity with the strike,” she said in a statement to NBC News. “Everything we celebrate and honor about movies and television is born out of their creation.” Production on some returning shows have also paused. Many TV showrunners shared their solidarity with fellow writers in updates for viewers on the status of their shows. Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer, known as the Duffer brothers, announced they’d halted production on season 5 of their hit Netflix series “Stranger Things."" “Writing does not stop when filming begins,” they wrote in a tweet Saturday. “While we’re excited to start production with our amazing cast and crew, it is not possible during this strike. We hope a fair deal is reached soon so we can all get back to work. Until then -- over and out. #wgastrong."" Jen Statsky, the creator of “Hacks,” tweeted that the HBO show is stopping production. “Writing happens at every stage of the process — production and post included. It’s what makes shows and movies good,” she wrote in her tweet. Quinta Brunson, creator and star of the Emmy Award-winning sitcom “Abbott Elementary,"" said she is also a part of the WGA and is on strike ""demanding fair compensation for writers!"" Writing for season three of Showtime’s “Yellowjackets” was put on hold after one day, according to co-creator Ashley Lyle. She said in a tweet that she hopes to return to the writers room after a fair deal is reached. “Cobra Kai” also closed its writers room for season six until a fair deal is agreed on, co-creator and writer Jon Hurwitz said on Twitter last week. ""We hate to strike, but if we must, we strike hard,"" he wrote. Mayer said viewers can expect that the writing on their favorite shows might be affected after the strike, even if the guild succeeds at negotiating sooner than expected. “We all have to jump back into writing and as the world changes, a storyline that might have been on a show that you like, depending on what’s going on in politics or whatever — the storyline will change,” he said. ""Game of Thrones"" creator George R.R. Martin confirmed that the second season of the “House of the Dragon” spinoff began filming April 11 in the United Kingdom and will continue production. “The scripts for the eight s2 episodes were all finished months ago, long before the strike began. Every episode has gone through four or five drafts and numerous rounds of revisions,” he wrote in a blog post Sunday. “There will be no further revisions. The writers have done their jobs; the rest is in the hands of the directors, cast and crew… and of course the dragons.” Martin emphasized his “unequivocal support” for the strike — and said that the writer's room for his other ""GOT"" spinoff, ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight,"" ""has closed for the duration."" Amazon Studios’ “Lord of The Rings: The Rings of Power,” which films in the U.K., is moving on with production, a spokesperson for the studio confirmed. Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” which films in Canada, halted production of its upcoming season. Creator Bruce Miller announced his participation in the strike and has been retweeting other writers' updates from the picket line. “We are on strike, we excused ourselves. Excused? What are we, seven years old? We don’t need to be excused, thanks,” he wrote in a tweet. International writing guilds including The Writers’ Guild of Great Britain, the Australian Writers’ Guild, The Writers Guild of Canada and The New Zealand Writers Guild have thrown their support behind the WGA. “As a fellow guild and member of the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds, the Writers Guild of Canada (WGC) will support the WGA during its strike to the fullest extent possible,” the WGC wrote in a memo. “The compensation issues raised by WGA writers are the same concerns affecting writers around the world.” The 2007-08 strike lasted 100 days and cost the California economy at least $2 billion, according to Mayer. He said the strike didn’t just affect the television and film industry, but also the entire city of Los Angeles. “It was a really painful period, restaurants suffered,” said Mayer, who also serves as associate dean of strategic initiatives and associate dean of faculty at the USC School of Dramatic Arts. “In a town like this, when the industry shuts down, everybody feels it.” In a town like this, when the industry shuts down, everybody feels it. -Oliver Mayer, professor of dramatic writing at the USC School of Dramatic Arts Viewers at the time also pointed out that some show finales or storylines didn’t make sense or were cut short. Emmy Award-winning series “Pushing Daisies,” whose first season was cut from 22 episodes to just nine, was canceled after two seasons, which some in the industry say happened as a result of the strike. Season two of “Friday Night Lights” was cut from 22 episodes to 15. Viewers criticized the season's plot surrounding Landry, a polite and humble student at Dillon High, played by Jesse Plemons, killed a guy. Season three didn’t follow up on previous storylines and provided little explanation for some events that happened in the previous season. “Heroes,” “Lost,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Chuck,” “Breaking Bad” and “Scrubs” were also among the popular shows that were interrupted by the strike. The strike also helped lead to the rise of reality television shows such as “The Apprentice” and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians."" (NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News, as well as NBC, which previously aired ""Heroes,” “Chuck” and “Friday Night Lights"" and “The Apprentice.” It is also the parent company of E!, which ran “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”) Mayer said he expects that networks and studios have stockpiled projects, especially when the potential of a strike loomed over the industry. So, there might be new shows and movies premiering that were finished months before their release. The production companies might finish the project at one time, “but they’re holding on to material that they can mete out over the course of months, even into the fall, to see how long they can go without having to compromise with our guild,” Mayer said.

What is Cinco de Mayo? This teacher's TikTok videos give the history through a Gen Z lens,Edwin Flores,"May 5, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Aimee Preciado has been participating in her local Cinco de Mayo celebrations in McFarland, California, for almost a decade now. For a long time she thought the Mexican holiday celebrated the country’s independence. “I just never thought too deeply about it,” said Preciado, 17, a junior of Mexican American heritage at McFarland High School. She learned more about the history and significance of Cinco de Mayo when she viewed a video on TikTok posted by her world history teacher. “So it’s May 5, 1862, aka Cinco de Mayo and the French are about to mess around and find out,” Lauren Cella, who teaches 10th grade world history at McFarland High, said in a TikTok post that’s since gathered more than 530,000 views. “In 1867, Mexico drives out the French and [Emperor Maximilian] gets unalived via firing squad and Mexico stays independent. Preguntas?” Cella, 30, who is of Mexican, Puerto Rican and Chinese heritage, has gathered more than 146,000 followers on TikTok for her content that explains world history through a Gen Z lens, including the latest slang, expressions and references to pop culture and trends. Her video on Cinco de Mayo had elicited more than 1,000 comments as of Thursday. “You make this so much more interesting,” one TikTok user commented, while another said it was the first time in their 49 years of life that they understood what Cinco de Mayo was about. Another added how they “learned more in a 2-minute or less TikTok video [compared] to a year of Latin America history class.” Cinco de Mayo is often associated in the U.S. with margaritas, beer, food and cultural celebrations. But unlike Mexico’s Independence Day, which is celebrated on Sept. 16, Cinco de Mayo commemorates the triumph of the Mexican army over the French army — which was considered the world’s strongest army at the time —  at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. “There is just such a lack of awareness in the United States about history, world history, especially from other cultures or traditions,” Cella said. “Even amongst the Mexican community, I think there’s still some confusion about where Cinco de Mayo comes from.” The Cinco de Mayo celebrations are actually much bigger in the U.S. than in Mexico. Over time the holiday in the U.S. evolved and became more commercial, as companies began promoting Cinco de Mayo in the 1980s and 1990s to reach more Latinos and other consumers of tequila and beer. Mexican and American histories are intertwined, and something often overlooked is the fact that it was Gen. Ignacio Zaragosa, a Texan born in what is now Goliad, who led the Mexican forces to victory over the French. “This fact should make Americans, especially Texans, very proud of their connection to that event,” Raul Ramos, of the University of Houston, told NBC News in 2016. “But often it doesn’t resonate. The Mexican aspect of Texas history has been so marginalized and ghettoized, it takes extra effort for people to learn about it.” In Cella’s classroom, most of her students are Latino. When her students say they don't particularly like history, she takes it on as a challenge. Cella's presentations and lectures differ from her TikTok videos online in that they are more traditional and in-depth than the 60-second clips she posts. But she’ll occasionally use words that are more relatable to her younger students. “The way that kids learn now with technology and their attention spans — you have to be able to relate it. You have to be able to break it down, and eventually, the academic vocabulary will come,” Cella said. “I do have to stay up to date with all of the lingo and the culture and the trends ... even if I don’t want to. I’m surrounded by teenagers.” “She would say things in a tone that was easy for us to understand, easy for us to grasp, and we weren’t bored. Like, I’ve never been bored a day in her class,” Preciado said. “She’s putting history in Gen Z’s words, basically, you know; it’s more appealing to us. We don’t want all the official stuff. We want more of the simple — the way she uses more of our slang, in a sense,” Lucas Rodriguez, 17, a senior in her journalism elective class, said. Cella said her students have found her TikTok videos and they’re her biggest supporters. “I’m sure it’s so cringy but it’s OK, I just embrace it. I am very, very lucky to have an amazing department and administration who is very supportive.” Most of the comments she gets online are actually from adults, she said, recounting how they didn’t learn or retain much history in school. She attributes learning falls through the cracks to the pressure teachers face to meet state testing and standards. Despite her efforts to offer relatable, bite-sized history lessons online, she’s received some criticism from commenters who deem her content too condensed. “You can’t tell the whole story in 60 seconds. The goal is to spark an interest and an understanding. And what I think is really cool, if you go to the comments, is people will, like, add things … They’re basically having this conversation, this class discussion in the comment section,” Cella said. “I think the approach has obviously resonated with people on the internet. And I’m really still very shocked that this many people care about history and are excited, and it’s really fun,” Cella said. "
Spanish-language songs inspired a history-making album — in Israel. They're back in the spotlight.,Patricia Guadalupe,"May 4, 2023, 4:31 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"When Michael Jackson released “Thriller” four decades ago, the epic album shot to No. 1 all around the world, but not in Israel — where an album paying homage to popular, romantic Spanish songs of the ‘70s and ‘80s ended up making music history. The album, “Ha’isha She’iti,” caused such a sensation that it became the bestselling album in the history of Israel’s music industry. Now, it's back in the spotlight as a special 40th anniversary release but with an important distinction: Instead of in Hebrew, the songs are in their original language. “Many people don’t realize that these songs were originally in Spanish,” internationally renowned singer-songwriter David Broza told NBC News, “and I decided to record them in Spanish as a token (of appreciation), not a lot of production, bare bones, the guitar and voice, letting the songs present themselves.” The result is Broza's new album, “La Mujer Que Yo Quiero” (“The Woman I Love”), whose title is one of three cover versions of songs by the singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat, whose 1971 album “Mediterráneo” has long been considered a Spanish-language classic. Forty years ago, Broza, an Israeli-born, multiplatinum artist, worked with Israeli poet Jonathan Geffen to translate into Hebrew hit songs from hugely popular Spanish singers like Serrat — a household name for many Spanish music fans. Over the years, Broza performed the chart-topping songs, sprinkling some Spanish with Hebrew. ""I discovered Serrat through Spanish friends in Madrid when I was 17,"" Broza said. ""When I went back to Israel at 18 for military service, I took with me the 'Mediterráneo' album, which was a huge success at the time. I listened to it over and over, and learned some of the songs. These songs, translated into Hebrew, became part of the “Ha’isha She’iti” album eight years later."" Broza, who has collaborated with artists such as Jackson Browne and Wyclef Jean, said he has long admired Serrat's pride in his Catalán culture and his political stand against fascism, but most importantly, his songwriting and performances. Broza considers his influences to be Spanish flamenco, American folk and rock 'n' roll, and poetry, including celebrated Spanish poets Federico García Lorca and Luis de Góngora. Interestingly, Broza, who divides his time between Tel Aviv and New York City, did not have any familial ties to the Spanish language or Spain except for having lived in Madrid for several years as a teenager with his family. “I can’t really explain why I’m dedicated to the degree that I am or why I’ve dedicated so many years to introducing Spanish music and culture to an Israeli audience and audiences around the world,” he said. Broza said another inspiration is Spanish musician Paco Ibáñez. “(He) was a troubadour and folk singer in exile in Paris, who had recorded and set to music many works by Federico García Lorca, Rafael Alberti and other renegade poets. I loved his guitar playing and the folk melodies that sounded as though they had been written hundreds of years ago,” Broza said. “In 1983 I hosted Paco Ibáñez in some of the big shows I did after the huge success of the album. He couldn’t believe his eyes as thousands of people were singing along with us in Hebrew. It was very powerful. At 88, Paco was and still is the renegade performer with his guitar!” And naturally for music from Spain, Broza looked to flamenco and flamenco performers. ""Manzanita was a hero to me and many others in Spain with his amazing guitar playing and his thick husky flamenco voice, singing melodic pop songs,"" Broza said of the late flamenco artist José Ortega Heredia, known as Manzanita, who had three of his songs on ""Ha’isha She’iti."" Despite his lack of familial ties to Spain or the Spanish language, Broza has been recognized for his work promulgating the music. “There actually is this little village near Cáceres in Spain called Brozas, and I met the mayor and other dignitaries and they decided I’m their lost son,” he chuckled. “Hey, maybe that’s where we got our name from.” Last October, Broza traveled to Spain to put together the new album and did it in one day, one take, recording nine songs — including Ibáñez's ""La Más Bella Niña"" (""The Most Beautiful Girl""), which was the first song translated into Hebrew that started the original project more than 40 years ago. The track comes from a 16th-century Spanish poem by Luis de Góngora. “Only after the (recording) session was over did I realize that I had immersed myself into the songs with my whole body and soul. It was so intense, it took me several days to unwind,” Broza said. “I almost feel like I’m breaking new boundaries and new frontiers with the music. I start from the very basic — I want this to be the bare bones of how a song was written and how it became a hit.” Following the album's recent release, Broza is doing a U.S. tour in the fall. “What I want to do in my performances is give you the most perfected performance I can possibly deliver of every song. I’m a little overwhelmed with all the reaction.” "
Hollywood writers go on strike after contract negotiations fail,Daniel Arkin,"May 2, 2023, 4:21 AM UTC / Updated May 2, 2023, 10:41 AM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Hollywood writers are closing their laptops and heading to the picket line. Thousands of unionized scribes who say they are not paid fairly in the streaming era went on strike early Tuesday, bringing television production to a halt. It comes after high-stakes negotiations between a top guild and a trade association representing Hollywood’s marquee studios failed to avert the first walkout in more than 15 years. The board of directors for the Writers Guild of America, which includes West Coast and East Coast branches, voted unanimously to call for a walkout and said writers face an “existential crisis.” “The companies’ behavior has created a gig economy inside a union work force, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing,” the union said in a statement. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers — a trade association that bargains on behalf of studios, television networks and streaming platforms — said in a statement that its offer included “generous increases in compensation for writers.” The main “sticking points,” according to the entertainment giants, include union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specific period of time, “whether needed or not.” The strike brings production on broadcast programs, streaming shows and potentially some films to a virtual standstill, upending the entertainment industry. (Comcast, the corporation that owns NBCUniversal, is one of the entertainment companies represented by the trade group. Some editorial employees of NBCUniversal's news division are represented by the Writers Guild of America.) In some cases, the impact will be clear immediately. Late-night talk shows are going dark this week, for example. In other cases, the producers of scripted drama and comedy series may be forced to cut their seasons short or delay filming altogether. This weekend's new episode of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” which Pete Davidson was to host with Lil Uzi Vert as the musical guest, was canceled because of the strike, according to a news release. ""SNL"" will air a repeat Saturday and until further notice, it said. The work stoppage comes amid intense economic and technological upheaval in Hollywood, which is grappling with the increasing dominance of streaming services, the decline of traditional broadcast viewership and even the rise of artificial intelligence, which has stoked anxiety about the future of creative professions. WGA members are seeking pay increases and structural changes to a business model that they say has made it increasingly difficult to make a living. In recent years, amid the explosion of streaming platforms such as Netflix and Disney+, median writer-producer pay has declined 4%, or 23% when adjusted for inflation, according to WGA statistics. “The companies have used the transition to streaming to cut writer pay and separate writing from production, worsening working conditions for series writers at all levels,” the WGA said in a bulletin March 14 titled “Writers Are Not Keeping Up.” The guild added that more writers are “working at minimum regardless of experience.” In contrast, salaries for top entertainment executives have ballooned in recent years. In a video message published April 11, comedy writer and producer Danielle Sanchez-Witzel (“The Carmichael Show”), a member of the WGA’s negotiating committee, said “this is not an ordinary negotiating cycle,” adding, “We’re fighting for writers’ economic survival and the stability of our profession.” The writers in the union are particularly frustrated that streaming-era shows run for fewer episodes than their broadcast counterparts, making it tough to maintain a consistent income. In addition, residual fees — money paid when a show is put into syndication or aired overseas — have all but disappeared as more content is hosted exclusively on streaming platforms. In an interview with “NBC Nightly News,” Raphael Bob-Waksberg, the creator of Netflix’s animated series “BoJack Horseman,” explained the writers’ demands in stark terms. “We want more money,” he said. “We want enough money to make a basic living doing what we love.” “I think we’re getting to the point where it’s going to be that the only people who can afford to try to start a career in television or movies are going to be people who are independently wealthy already, which I don’t think is good for television or movies. I don’t think we want that,” Bob-Waksberg said. The alliance represents major film studios such as Disney, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros.; the top broadcast television networks, such as ABC, CBS and NBC; and the leading streaming services, including Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon. (Universal Pictures is a unit of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.) ""The AMPTP member companies remain united in their desire to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry, and to avoid hardship to the thousands of employees who depend upon the industry for their livelihoods,"" the organization said in a statement Monday night. ""The AMPTP is willing to engage in discussions with the WGA in an effort to break this logjam."" WGA members last went on strike in November 2007 amid an impasse with the AMPTP over writers’ salaries and other issues. The work stoppage clogged Hollywood’s content production pipeline and lasted 100 days, ending on Feb. 12, 2008. The union is facing issues that might have been unfathomable during the last strike, when Netflix was best known for shipping DVDs in red envelopes and traditional network television channels still generated mammoth ratings. In one sign of the times, the WGA’s demands for this negotiation cycle include regulations for the “use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies.” "
Met Gala 2023: What you need to know ahead of tonight’s event,Brahmjot Kaur,"May 1, 2023, 8:02 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Fashion's biggest night is back. Celebrities will roll up to the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday in their finest, larger-than-life attire. The event, also known as the Costume Institute Benefit, began in 1948 as a dinner that invited guests for $50 a ticket, according to the museum. It has since evolved into the biggest — and most exclusive — night in fashion, with spectators and fans eager to see their favorite stars showing off their designer outfits. The invitation-only event includes a theme every year and raises funds to support The Costume Institute. Here's what else to know. This year, the gala is paying tribute to the legendary German designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019 at 85. The theme is “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,"" and the dress code is “in honor of Karl.” Actress Penélope Cruz, musician Dua Lipa, tennis star Roger Federer and actress/screenwriter Michaela Coel are the co-chairs. They are taking over from last year's co-chairs: Regina King, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Lin-Manuel Miranda. The guest list for the gala is top secret — but as always, Met Gala fans can expect to see the biggest stars, influencers and fashion icons walking the carpet. There are usually about 600 attendees, according to Vogue. The four co-chairs, listed above, will of course be there alongside Vogue editor-in-chief herself, Anna Wintour. Among the other A-listers: Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz-Beckham confirmed their attendance, according to People magazine. The actresses Priyanka Chopra and Elle Fanning also confirmed their attendance to Variety last month. Singer Rita Ora posted a photo on Instagram days ago, where she wrote: ""Mid week catch up/praise you promo nyc style/ met fittings which I can’t show atm and just life really."" There were rumors this year that the Kardashians weren't invited to the soiree. But last week, Kim Kardashian posted a photo on Instagram visiting Lagerfeld's office ""to get a little inspiration for the Met."" Not every celebrity will be there. Some aren't invited, others are just busy. Lively, who has wowed viewers with her outfits each year, said she was not attending this year. She announced her decision at the re-opening of the Tiffany & Co. Fifth Avenue store last month, People reported. Actor Jonathan Majors, who was arrested in March on an assault charge in an alleged domestic dispute, will also not attend this year. Initially planning to be a guest of Valentino, the fashion house and Major ""mutually agreed"" the actor would not be there, according to Deadline. Kim Kardashian wore Marilyn Monroe’s iconic gown to celebrate the 2022 theme: “In America: An Anthology of Fashion.” The gown, which Monroe wore during her “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” performance for John F. Kennedy, is 60 years old. But Kardashian was widely criticized for wearing it to the Met Gala because of the historic significance and delicate construction of the garment. Images of the dress with and without damage to the seams spread online, with many people claiming that the rips, missing crystals and puckering seams were caused by Kardashian’s Met Gala carpet walk. Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, which bought the gown in 2016 for $4.8 million, said Kardashian did not damage it. Of course. Stars at the Met Gala always sport looks that turn heads. But some of these extreme costumes and styles often inspire countless memes. For example, in 2021, Kardashian's head-to-toe black Balenciaga proved to be meme fodder for everyone online. Rihanna’s 2015 gold Guo Pei gown, which featured a fur-lined cape with a 16-foot train, also became an iconic meme. Memes have become such a large part of online reaction to the gala that in 2021 Saint Hoax, an influencer with more than 3.4 million followers on Instagram, made memes live from the event’s red carpet. That same year, a handful of influencers — including @Mytherapistsays, @ideservecouture @Mufashdia, @juliancookies and @eljosecriales — provided live commentary and Reels around some of the carpet’s most iconic looks using hashtags such as #ReelMetIcons & #MemetheMet. Because the actual gala is a private dinner inside the museum, it’s not broadcast. But the red carpet, which kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET, will have a livestream that can be watched via Vogue’s digital platforms and social media including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Vogue announced that its livestream will be hosted by actor and producer La La Anthony, alongside Derek Blasberg and Chloe Fineman. Influencer Emma Chamberlain is returning as the publication's special correspondent. And photos from inside often get shared after the event itself. "
New Mexico Spanish descendants work to preserve 400-year-old adobe churches,Associated Press,"May 1, 2023, 1:24 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"CORDOVA, New Mexico  — Ever since missionaries started building churches out of mud 400 years ago in what was the isolated frontier of the Spanish empire, tiny mountain communities like Cordova relied on their own resources to keep the faith going. Thousands of miles from religious and lay seats of power, everything from priests to sculptors to paint pigments was hard to come by. Villagers instituted lay church caretakers called “mayordomos,” and filled chapels with elaborate altarpieces made of local wood and varnished with pine sap. Today, threatened by depopulation, dwindling congregations and fading traditions, some of their descendants are fighting to save these historic adobe structures from literally crumbling back to the earth they were built with. “Our ancestors put blood and sweat in this place for us to have Jesus present. This is the root of my faith,” said Angelo Sandoval on a chilly spring day inside the 1830s church of St. Anthony, where he serves as mayordomo in his native Cordova. “We’re not just a church, we’re not just a religion — we have roots.” From the local dirt they’re made of to the generations of family memories they hold, these churches anchor a uniquely New Mexican way of life for their communities, many of which no longer have schools or stores, and struggle with chronic poverty and addiction. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to find the necessary investment — hundreds of thousands of dollars, plus specialized conservation skills and families willing to serve as mayordomos — to preserve them, especially since most are used for only a few services each year. “It’s truly a labor of love,” said the Rev. Rob Yaksich, pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows in Las Vegas, New Mexico, which oversees 23 rural churches, most in adobe, spread over a large territory. “When the faithful generation is gone, are they going to be a museum or serve their purpose? This old, deep-rooted Spanish Catholicism is experiencing serious disruption.” "
Adidas shareholders launch class-action lawsuit over Ye fallout,Chantal Da Silva,"May 1, 2023, 1:18 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Adidas shareholders have launched a class-action lawsuit alleging the sportswear brand knew about the potential harm that the ""personal behavior"" of Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — could cause the company, but failed to warn investors. The lawsuit alleges that Adidas' former chief executive officer, Kasper Rorsted, and chief financial officer, Harm Ohlmeyer, either ""intended to deceive"" investors or ""acted with reckless disregard for the truth"" by failing to disclose issues between the company and Ye. It was filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon — Portland is home to the German company's North American headquarters. ""We outright reject these unfounded claims and will take all necessary measures to vigorously defend ourselves against them,"" a spokesperson for Adidas said in a statement. Rorsted did not immediately reply to a request for comment sent to an email address associated with him. Adidas cut ties with Ye in October after facing widespread pressure to end its partnership with the rapper in the wake of his antisemitic comments. However, the suit alleges that the company had known for years about behavior from Ye, who is not party to the lawsuit, but failed to disclose the potential risks to the company and its investors in a string of annual reports. The lawsuit cites a report by The Wall Street Journal in November that cited people familiar with the matter and documents it reviewed. According to the report, Adidas executives, including Rorsted, had discussed the risk of Ye’s behavior and considered cutting ties with him. The suit notes that Ye's collaboration with Adidas, which saw the rapper design the hugely successful Yeezy line of trainers for the company, initially had a ""positive impact on the Company."" ""The Yeezy shoes were extremely popular,"" the lawsuit states. ""By 2019, sales of Yeezy shoes hit over $1 billion. Further, Kanye West accumulated significant wealth as a result of the Partnership. By September 2019, Forbes ranked him as the Number 1 highest-paid hip-hop star, largely as a result of the Partnership,"" it says. However, the suit notes that in the midst of that success, Ye, who has spoken openly about living with bipolar disorder, was making increasingly controversial comments, which Adidas officials appeared to address at the time. In May 2018, while speaking on TMZ Live, Ye said slavery ""sounds like a choice"" because it had lasted ""for 400 years,"" the lawsuit notes. Days later, Rorsted said in a televised interview with Bloomberg, while declining to address Ye's specific comments about slavery, that there were clearly ""some comments we don't support."" ""Tellingly, Rorsted also stated that West and the Yeezy footwear brand are a 'very important part of our brand from a revenue standpoint and how we promote our products',"" the lawsuit states. At the time, Rorsted had also said he had not considered dropping Ye in the prior 24 hours, it notes. The lawsuit alleges that in an annual report for the year 2018, released March 13, 2019, Adidas ""ignored serious issues affecting the Partnership"" with Ye ""and the resulting potential risk to shareholders"" in a section outlining ""Business Partner Risk."" It said the company had generally alluded to risks involving individuals it was partnered with, instead of ""stating that the Company had actually considered ending the Partnership as a result of West's personal behavior, or how the Company's reputation might be affected if his behavior as it related to the Company were to become public."" In an inventory risk section of the report, the lawsuit further states that Adidas ignored the risks of oversupply of Yeezy-branded shoes in the event that the partnership were to suddenly end ""and in particular, if demand for the shoes were to fall due to any controversy surrounding West."" It said the company's 2019, 2020 and 2021 annual reports either had similar language regarding such potential risks or ""otherwise failed to mention risks relating to the Partnership."" "
The chronically online third culture is redefining Asian America,Sakshi Venkatraman,"May 1, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"It’s a new era in Asian America, and the TikTok generation is running it. Scroll a few times on your For You page and you’ll easily come across several Asian “It Girls” bringing in millions of views showing off ancient beauty rituals. A few more swipes up and you might find home cooks packing bento boxes or musicians mixing ’70s Bollywood songs with viral pop hits. The panic of opening an ethnic lunchbox in a crowded cafeteria is dead to them. It has been traded in for videos of their moms’ recipes narrated by artificial intelligence. The teasing endured for expressive classical dances is in the rearview mirror. They’re now making money doing the same dances on the internet. What was once a burning thirst for representation has been satiated, even drowned, on the internet, young people said. And for a generation of Asian Americans raised on social media, whose culture has always been ill-defined, stereotyped, asterisked, relegated to the sidelines and viewed in the shadow of whiteness, coming into their own means putting a heritage they once tried to bury on full display. “They’re moving through the world in a way where they don’t feel like they have to explain themselves,” said Christine Bacareza Balance, the director of the Asian American studies department at Cornell University. “There’s an enjoyment of being Asian American.” They’re moving through the world in a way where they don’t feel like they have to explain themselves."" — Christine Bacareza Balance, Cornell University Professor Existing in two worlds, often in conflict with each other, isn’t a new concept, experts said. But there’s something different about the way those in the internet generation are navigating life. Social media in many ways has set them free from the rigidity of white society’s standards; they’ve created their own spaces, their own stars and their own expectations for how their lives might look. It isn’t what their parents came from; nor does it resemble the lives of their white peers. What felt like a childhood of collective identity crisis has finally settled into a quiet confidence, and many in Gen Z say they’re now comfortable, even thriving, with what they’ve found in the middle. Ten years ago, flipping the channels or even scrolling on YouTube’s homepage, Asian American kids would be hard-pressed to find one or two famous faces from the community. Now on TikTok, they can easily scroll past a dozen in a few minutes. In contrast to the pre-2000s media that had few Asian American voices, the internet generation offered an instant-engagement, free-of-charge alternative. Digital communities began to form, giving birth to new kinds of stars. Facebook pages like Subtle Asian Traits made space for mutual recognition; middle schoolers who were the only Asians in their towns could now log on and talk to thousands of others. Filmmakers like Wong Fu Productions, which made Asian-centric short films, took their work to YouTube. Suddenly, the bar for achieving representation was much lower. “There were no longer gatekeepers. You no longer had to wait for Hollywood to greenlight you,” Balance said. So the chronically online third culture kid was born. And YouTube ushered in an era of Asian American celebrities who were speaking directly to them, in real time. They based their content on the experience of dealing with foreign parents, the disconnect they had with their white peers, the unique challenges of dating as first-gens. “They really captured how they were feeling and the things that they were experiencing in a way that mainstream media was not,” Balance said. Twitter in its early days lent itself to community-building, too, said Aaron Yin, 28, a comedian and content creator who co-hosts the podcast “Politically Asian!” “There were group chats, not just for Asian people, but also just anyone nonwhite on Twitter, because sometimes Twitter felt very white,” he said. “That kind of helped develop my consciousness a little bit more around race.” Younger Gen Zers who became adults long after that era probably can’t remember a time when Asian social media figures weren’t around, Balance said. So when TikTok exploded, they were unflinching about stepping into that role. “When TikTok came around, it completely changed everything,” said Malvika Sheth, a 24-year-old Gujarati American influencer who has gained over 100,000 followers on Instagram for her fashion content. Her TikTok outfit-of-the-day videos, often featuring traditional Indian jewelry or fabrics, have collectively been viewed by millions. Without as much as a search, relatable and fantastical people of color can appear on your For You page by the dozen — Asian people across communities and ethnicities living out every lifestyle imaginable and getting famous doing it. Storytellers, comedians and musicians weave culture into their content in ways that feel implicit and natural, young people said. There are Asian people who show off their daily routines in Los Angeles and New York and others who live woodland fantasies. “It’s about the range,” Balance said. “Stories being told, emotions being expressed. What’s different for Gen Z is that there’s a kind of diversity and a heterogeneity in the stories being told.” Yin said we’re past the point of representation for its own sake, especially if that representation is achieved by bending to a white system. He uses his platforms to poke fun at what he sees as the wrong kind of representation; he created a list of “8 Asian American Trailblazers Who Made Things Worse,” which included designer Alexander Wang and Ajit Pai, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “Especially with younger people I talk to, there’s not really that issue of ‘Oh, I want to see someone that looks like me,’” he said. “To be honest, when I hear that sentence, I think the person might be 35-plus.” Asian American young people know how to create the kind of representation they want, on their own terms, and they know their culture can be a tool to get them there, not a hindrance. “I think just the format of short-form videos helped me express myself a lot more,” Sheth said. “Seeing other brown people doing amazing things really helped me tell myself, ‘Yeah, you’re worthy of trying for these big things.’” And seeing TikTok’s Asian cool kids embracing their roots in public has ushered in a homecoming for many Gen Zers on the app. A passerby walking down Naomi Namboodiripad’s dorm hallway might hear the familiar sound of the latest in hip-hop thumping from behind her door. But inside, Namboodiripad, 21, a TikTok celebrity, is preparing for an all-out Bharatanatyam dance performance. Clad head to toe in an ornate South Indian blouse and skirt, she films herself doing ancient traditional steps to the beats of Beyoncé and Apollo Fresh. The video she’s recording will drop to an audience of 350,000. Views and likes often hit the millions. “Younger me would be shocked,” said Namboodiripad, a junior at Columbia University. Growing up in her white suburb, she never really felt the need to hide her culture. But she remembers being teased by her white peers once when she performed Bharatanatyam for them. She never felt like there was a real forum to show off what she learned in the dance style, characterized by dramatic facial expressions, widened eyes and hand movements. “I just felt like I was a little bit trapped,” she said. “I did want to embrace my Indian culture, but I had no one to do it with outside of my family.” Balance said Asian culture in Western art too often comes with an asterisk. Foods, communities, cultures and practices are spelled out for a white consumer base in painful detail. Gen Z is over it. “TikTok is really bringing all these cultures together that don’t know about each other, and we’re learning without having to be baby-spoon-fed,” Namboodiripad said. “Like, ‘Oh, this means this, that means that.’ None of that needs to be said.” TikTok is really bringing all these cultures together that don’t know about each other, and we’re learning without having to be baby-spoon-fed."" — Naomi Namboodiripad, 21, Influencer For Sheth, that means not forcing herself in either direction. In her fashion content, she often wrestles with whether she should be leaning into her Indian identity more. But ultimately, she wants her work to feel authentic to her. “Because of college, because of dance, because of all of these experiences, when I started creating content online, I always knew that I wanted to mix my culture in the most natural way,” she said. “Like, I don’t wear Indian clothes every day. But if I’m going somewhere casual and I feel like throwing on a jhumki, I can.” Some say they have felt a similar transition — the cultural panic of childhood has turned into a gentle drift. Existing in the middle is becoming easier. Sheth sees the third culture not as just a set of practices or traits but as an unpacking and rebuilding of both the cultures she comes from. As her parents’ eldest daughter, for example, she sees the burden that often falls on the shoulders of Indian women in their family units. In the third culture, there’s a balance that can be achieved between that lifestyle and American individualism, she said. She pursues her own life, but she still helps her family and calls her mom multiple times every day. “Sometimes it’s really asking myself and telling myself not to feel guilty when I do want to do things for myself,” she said. Yin has turned his focus to Chinatown communities in New York City, making TikTok videos satirizing exploitation by powerful landlords and city officials. He sees comedy as an avenue for reaching young people, hopefully moving them to take real-world action. He takes his word to the street, picketing, organizing and protesting the issues he’s vocal about on TikTok and on his podcast. Young Asian creators don’t care if what they’re making is niche, they said. If they care about it, they’ll put it out into the world, and if others want to be a part of it, they’ll get on board, too. “I feel, like, 60% rage everyday and then 20% hope and 20% sadness,” he said. “But I don’t feel angry in, like, a hopeless way. More in a ‘I don’t want to give up’ kind of way.” "
Ticketmaster says ‘Verified Fan’ registration doesn’t measure fandom. Some fans think it should.,Daysia Tolentino,"April 30, 2023, 11:00 AM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Die-hard fans put in hours of work to support their favorite artists. They’ll stream the artists’ music countless times, post about them online, buy their new releases in every format and give musicians marketing that money can’t pay for — all free. The least they can get in return, some say, is priority access to concert tickets. But Ticketmaster doesn’t account for dedication when it selects buyers to participate in its Verified Fan system. Some fans want that to change. “It just gets a little frustrating as a fan sometimes, feeling like there’s a lack of control,” said Kierra Robinson, a Paramore fan. “Most people don’t really like Verified Fan, because it’s based on nothing.” A representative for Ticketmaster said in an email that “Verified Fan is not a measure of how big a fan anybody is, it is intended to help drive ticket sales to fans and not resellers.” The Verified Fan system requires buyers to register for ticket sales using their Ticketmaster accounts, email addresses and phone numbers. Ticketmaster says that after registration, it confirms that the registrants aren’t bots and don’t have histories of irregular ticket-buying behavior. Then, Ticketmaster selects which buyers get access codes for sales and which are put on waitlists using a lottery-style process. Subimal Chatterjee, a distinguished teaching professor of marketing at Binghamton University, said Ticketmaster has been clear that its objective with the Verified Fan system is to keep out scalpers. He said that Verified Fan doesn’t exist to “reward the committed fan” but that many consumers may have mistakenly thought so because of the system’s name. Chatterjee said the system sets up the expectation that “if I become, somehow, a verified fan, I’ll get a ticket,” adding, “But that’s not Ticketmaster’s aim in this case.” According to the Ticketmaster website, Verified Fan allows artists to “give their fans a better chance at buying tickets by creating an extra line of defense against bots and professional resellers.” A Ticketmaster representative said about 5% of tickets from Verified Fan sales typically end up on the secondary market, compared to 20% to 30% during non-Verified Fan sales. Still, fans like Sophia Lopez, who has seen artists like Harry Styles in concert, believe some people who sign up “aren’t even fans — they’re usually scalpers.” Fans were optimistic about Verified Fan when it was rolled out in 2017, believing it to be a step toward ensuring real fans get tickets. However, as time has passed, they are becoming increasingly disillusioned. Kaylee Cordray said it is “so easy” for people to get Verified Fan access codes, whether or not they are huge fans of an artist. Cordray, who is a fan of several artists, including Taylor Swift, was able to secure a Verified Fan presale code for Swift’s “Eras” tour. However, she said, many of her fan friends — even those more dedicated than she — didn’t get codes, making resale tickets their only option. For years, fans have complained that the system doesn’t do enough to prevent resellers from participating in such sales. While Ticketmaster doesn’t measure fandom with Verified Fan, fans think doing so would ensure the right people would secure tickets — and create a lot more happy customers. Lopez, who is a fan of several artists, including Styles, suggested Ticketmaster should allow fans to show “a history of purchasing merch, your Apple Music streaming history or your Spotify Wrapped or past history of buying concert tickets” to verify fandom. “I wouldn’t feel as bad [getting waitlisted], because I know there’s probably people out there that have spent more time listening to his music, have spent more money on his merch, all of this stuff,” she said. “I feel like I would have a better chance than most, but I know there’s definitely people out there that have a better chance than me.” She added: “General on-sale and stuff like that, it’s fine; anybody can do it. But the Verified Fan presales really should only be for fans.” General on-sale and stuff like that, it’s fine; anybody can do it. But the Verified Fan presales really should only be for fans. — Sophia Lopez, a fan While incorporating streaming data and fan engagement is a popular suggestion among fans, Larry Miller, the director of the music business program at New York University, said there may be privacy issues in allowing Ticketmaster to have access to more of users’ data. However, he said, an opt-in process could address the issue. “Maybe that would be a good thing,” he said. “It would surprise me if those conversations were not already happening between Ticketmaster and the [streaming] services.” Spotify does offer exclusive concert ticket presale codes to top fans of certain artists, but Spotify presales aren’t typical during most big ticket sales. Some Swift fans, including Cordray, believed the “Eras” presale should have used a similar boost system to the one used during Swift’s 2017 “Reputation” tour, which rewarded fans who bought merchandise or interacted with certain Swift videos with points that increased their chances of getting tickets. While the method was criticized for gamifying ticket-buying at the time, fans say it was a better way to ensure they got tickets. “I think that would be more helpful than the way that we have it now,” Cordray said. Ticketmaster has been widely scrutinized in recent months after the disastrous “Eras” tour presale, which led to a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee to examine its outsize role in the ticketing industry. During the “Eras” presale, fans reported getting kicked out of the sale, hourslong waits to buy tickets and high fees. Since then, artists have been experimenting with ways to ensure their fans get tickets. The singer Maggie Rogers, for example, held an in-person-only presale that required fans to go to their local box offices to buy tickets. Ticketmaster said that at an artist’s request, it takes “certain criteria provided by the artist — including fan club membership, past merchandise purchases, or other artist-defined criteria — in an attempt to better identify fans who are likely to purchase tickets and actually attend the show for which they’re registering.” Pearl Jam reserved 90% of tickets for its coming tour for its paying fan club members. The Cure made its tickets nontransferable to curb scalping. Fan dissatisfaction at the ticket-buying experience isn’t new. Miller recounts his outrage as a 14-year-old camping out at the box office to buy Led Zeppelin tickets and missing out. However, he said, he believes Ticketmaster is working hard to “mitigate the kinds of gaffes that led to their public, very pointed questioning in Washington earlier this year.” Still, with fan complaints about Ticketmaster and the Verified Fan process still rampant, Chatterjee, of Binghamton University, said it’s clear “something is broken.” “It’s an issue that doesn’t seem to be going away. I’m sure Ticketmaster will come up with something in the next few months. If the Verified Fan doesn’t work, then something new,” he said. “But the bottom line is, of course, you know, there will be disappointed people. Because the sad truth is that the demand far, far exceeds capacity.” "
"Latinos lag in lead roles on Netflix, despite gains in Asian, female representation",Reuters,"April 28, 2023, 1:56 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Netflix Inc has increased the number of Asian and women in lead roles, but still lags in representing Latinos, the disabled and women of color, a study by the streaming platform and the University of Southern California (USC) found. While Hollywood has made strides in diversity in recent years, some communities criticize the lack of progress, both on and off screen. To understand the lack of representation in the industry, Netflix partnered with USC and founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, Dr. Stacy L. Smith, to analyze the inclusion metrics of the streaming service from 2018 to 2021 based on gender, race/ethnicity, LGBTQ+ and disability. The study released on Thursday showed increased opportunities for women in lead roles, directing and key creative jobs. However, Netflix still lacks significant representation of characters with disabilities, gender-balanced storytelling in series, roles for girls and women of color and opportunities for women writers. Despite 27% of the U.S. population identifying as disabled, only 1.1% of all characters in Netflix films and series have a disability, the study found. Latinos, who make up 19% of the U.S. population, acted in 4.5% of main cast roles on Netflix in 2021, up from 2.6% in 2018. That compares with 17.1% for Black actors and 9.4% for Asian actors. Only 1.9% of writers for Netflix films have been Latino, the study said. Asian casting has improved markedly, with 41.5% of Netflix series having an Asian lead or co-lead in 2021, after making up only 4% of leads and co-leads in both films and series in 2018. Shows featuring girls and women have increased significantly, from 46.4% in films and 50.6% in series in 2018 to 55% for both in 2021. "
"In 'The Black Demon' movie and comics, a primeval shark offers a cautionary tale",Arturo Conde,"April 28, 2023, 12:05 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Stories passed down by generations of fishermen off Mexico’s Baja California peninsula are the inspiration behind a new survival thriller movie featuring an 80-foot large-toothed monster. “The Black Demon,” premiering Friday, tells the story of oilman Paul Sturges (played by Josh Lucas), who desperately tries to save his family on an oil rig while battling a massive primeval shark. “The movie is like ‘Jaws,’ if Jaws were sent by Indigenous gods to make humanity pay for messing with the ocean,” said David Bowles, a co-creator of the “Black Demon Tales,” a comic book series that expands and develops the story of the film. Bowles said in an interview that a story about a megalodon — an extinct giant shark that could have been three times longer than the biggest great white shark — can be terrifying and exciting. But both the movie and the comics aim to deliver a deeper cautionary tale from Aztec and Maya civilizations to people all over the world today. “We spend much of our lives doing things that are of the moment, convenient, without thinking about the consequences. And when those consequences catch up to us, it can be devastating,” he said. “‘The Black Demon’ is a metaphor for the actual environmental consequences that are waiting for us. It may not be a shark that leaps out of the water to destroy our boats as we try to escape. But climate change events cause massive destruction in our lives.” Because the fishermen who passed on stories claimed that their grandfathers and great-grandfathers witnessed attacks from the same shark over the span of a century, Bowles said, the legend inspired a supernatural twist in the movie and the comics that connects to Aztec and Maya mythology. Giant sea monsters were important in Mesoamerican cultures. One of those primordial creatures was known as “Cipactli” in the Aztec language or “Sipak” in Mayan. Bowles describes it as a “leviathan that the gods had to wrestle into submission to create the Earth on its back.” The sea monster had a single giant tooth that could resemble the fossilized teeth of a megalodon, which archaeologists have found at ancient Indigenous sites in southern Mexico. For Hector Rodriguez, a co-creator of the “Black Demon Tales” with Bowles, telling the story about the big Indigenous monsters was like writing a love letter to Godzilla and other Japanese monsters known as kaiju. Rodriguez and Bowles said they grew up watching Japanese movies about Godzilla dubbed in English and Spanish. And while “The Black Demon” is based specifically on Indigenous mythology, fans of big monsters all over the world will recognize something familiar in it. “We have our own giant monsters,” Rodriguez said, referring to Aztec and Maya mythology. “And part of the idea for ‘The Black Demon’ is to build out a kaiju universe full of massive monsters that are connected with Indigenous gods.” The comic book series expands the story from the film to show how the Black Demon was created to protect the environment from humanity. And every issue tells a story about the supernatural shark  serving Indigenous gods throughout different periods in history and alternate timelines. The first issue of the comic book series, which was published April 19, takes readers back to the 1980s, when the Mexican navy tries to keep the legend of the Black Demon a secret. The second issue, which will be released in mid-July, is set during the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 1500s, pitting the supernatural shark against the colonial Spanish. And the third issue, releasing in mid-August, will take place in an alternate universe where Mexico is divided between the Soviet Union and the U.S. in the Cold War. Rodriguez described the Black Demon as a harbinger or warning of nature that connects the fate of ancient civilizations with humanity today. “You have these civilization-ending events throughout history,” he said. “And legends like ‘The Black Demon’ are created to warn people about the dangers of their actions and how they can tip the balance of nature.” Boise Esquerra, the movie’s screenwriter, said Indigenous peoples have tried to preach for hundreds of years that humanity is called on to protect the Earth. “We are supposed to be the stewards of this planet,” he said in an interview. “You can take what you need from it. You can take what you need to survive. But instead, we are literally destroying the world without knowing it.” Ancient civilizations like the Aztecs faced climate change events, Esquerra said, and we can learn lifesaving lessons from their environmental disasters. Scientists have shown in a study how tree rings revealed super droughts that lasted almost two decades in Mesoamerica. And such events coincided with famines that could have contributed to the Aztec empire’s decline. While “The Black Demon” is a story about an ancient supernatural monster, the legend delivers a very sobering message for viewers today, Esquerra said. “Be aware of what you are doing on the planet. Appreciate the world that we have,” he said. “Nature is fighting back,"" he said, and humanity will have to answer for the consequences. "
"Jerry Springer, face of America's most lurid talk show, opened the era of 'trash TV'",Daniel Arkin,"April 27, 2023, 6:09 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"In the 1990s, Jerry Springer ruled American daytime television. He was the ringmaster of a vulgar circus, a brash showman who some critics accused of dumbing down the culture. In the words of one magazine profile, Springer was a ""purveyor of the puerile and arbiter of the aberrant."" He was also a small-screen pioneer. The talk-show host, who died Thursday at 79, helped usher in a new era of television that is instantly recognizable to anyone who has scrolled through a cable guide in the last 30 years: gleefully lowbrow, unapologetically raucous and can't-look-away addictive. Springer’s cultural influence can be felt across several genres, from reality television shows and bombastic cable news broadcasts to the all-too-real political spectacles that blur the line between the two. He intuited that the appetite for fist-throwing, chair-hurling, profanity-spewing, high-decibel chaos could be tapped for ratings gold. ""The Jerry Springer Show,"" at its peak in the '90s, was a commercial smash and certifiable cultural phenomenon. He was not the only talk-show provocateur of the time. Ricki Lake, Maury Povich, Sally Jessy Raphael and Montel Williams also treated their viewers to a seemingly endless parade of dysfunctional families and feuding couples. But the Springer circus was the market leader by far. None of his competitors were big enough to inspire a feature-length film: ""Ringmaster,"" a $20 million comedy starring Springer as a fictional version of himself named Jerry Farrelly, debuted in theaters in November 1998. (The tagline: ""America's #1 Action Hero."") Springer was seen by some at the time as a pariah — the ""new Satan,"" as the humorist David Sedaris wrote in an essay for The New York Times in 1998. Yet there was a disarming earnestness to his on-screen persona. Springer's catchphrase: ""Take care of yourself, and each other."" In some interviews, Springer seemed to distance himself from the tabloid sensationalism of his most famous creation. After all, he was the former mayor of Cincinnati who had once worked on Robert F. Kennedy's ill-fated presidential campaign. ""I would never watch my show,"" Springer told Reuters in 2000. ""I'm not interested in it; it's not aimed toward me. This is just a silly show. I don't take it seriously."" But in the same interview, Springer appeared to defend the worthiness of his creation, which often put a national spotlight on taboo subjects and outside-the-mainstream guests. ""When people argue about the show intellectually,"" he said, ""then I’m prepared to answer about why I think it is OK to do it and why I think it’s important that shows like that are on the air."" ""The Jerry Springer Show"" may have been built on nonstop confrontation between guests. But for years, Springer and his audience got along famously. ""Jerry’s ability to connect with people was at the heart of his success in everything he tried,"" Springer family spokesperson Jean Galvin said Thursday, ""whether that was politics, broadcasting or just joking with people on the street who wanted a photo or a word.""

Olive oil company's CEO goes viral for calling out competitor on LinkedIn,Daysia Tolentino,"April 26, 2023, 11:04 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"The CEO of an olive oil brand prompted viral backlash for his LinkedIn post bemoaning “copycats” after a competitor released a product sold in squeeze bottles similar to his company's. Andrew Benin, CEO of Graza, wrote that he posted on LinkedIn to show ""it's ok to get miffed when folks rip you off."" “while friendly competition was always welcome, I do view this as a blatant disrespect and am choosing to voice my discontent,” Benin wrote in his original post, calling out the olive oil company Brightland and its CEO, Aishwarya Iyer. But Benin quickly updated the post to apologize after other LinkedIn users, including fellow entrepreneurs, criticized him. Most of Brightland's products come in recycled glass bottles. Benin added in his post that another unnamed brand had tried to buy Graza’s bottles and molds from the company’s manufacturer in Spain the previous week. Representatives for Graza did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brightland declined to comment. Benin received mixed responses as his post went viral across social media. While some Twitter and TikTok users delighted in the drama, others felt Benin's post was petty and inappropriate. ""This post does good for no one. Why not lift up others in the industry if you're going to post anything instead of admonish them? Especially a direct attack on a founder that's a woman of color. I love Graza, have restocked multiple times, but this leaves a bad taste in my mouth that a founder would treat a competitor like this,"" one comment read. ""Damn dude. This is not it. P.S., my mom was buying squeezy bottle olive oil in 2007 (and it wasn’t Graza),"" another said. The concept of the squeeze bottle, as many online spectators pointed out, is not new. Graza itself has explained that the decision to put its oil in plastic squeeze bottles was inspired by the way chefs use them to streamline the cooking process. However, Graza is often credited with bringing the vessels to the masses. Some onlookers commented that Brightland's new pizza oil bottle should be looked at as a compliment toward Graza. ""Congrats, they’ve caught up. Focus on your game,"" one LinkedIn user said. In his apology, Benin wrote he is “insanely passionate about protecting what our team has worked so hard to build.” He said the original post “was out of character for me, and there was no need to insert so much negativity into our day.” “I was heated, and reacted poorly, and have learned from the variety of comments that everyone has left today,” he wrote. “Thank you to everyone for your candor, and for showing me that there was clearly a better way to address all of this.” Neither Brightland nor Iyer posted public responses, but social media accounts for both celebrated the launch and support for the brand’s pizza oil throughout the day on Tuesday.

'He made America better': Death of Harry Belafonte prompts outpouring of tributes,Rima Abdelkader,"April 25, 2023, 7:24 PM UTC / Updated April 25, 2023, 7:55 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Entertainers, lawmakers, clergy, academics and titans of industry celebrated the life of Harry Belafonte on Tuesday, remembering the ""uncompromising black man"" who ""made America better."" Belafonte died in his New York City home Tuesday, ending a 96-year life marked by inspiring music, moving performances and dogged determination throughout the civil rights era. ""Harry Belafonte, a proud, uncompromising black man, helped change the world. He could have been content to being merely a 'star,'"" former Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. ""He was certainly that. But he used the power his artistic gifts gave him to make better the lives for those too often forgotten or too often oppressed. His was a consequential life."" Holder, the first Black attorney general, observed that Belafonte outlived almost all of his 1960s peers, such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""His support of, and work with, Dr. King is a testament to his commitment and loyalty,"" Holder said. ""He made America better."" Beatrice King, King's daughter, fondly remembered Belafonte's being at her family's side in both good times and bad. She posted a picture of him at her father's funeral. ""I won’t forget,"" she wrote. ""Rest well, sir."" The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, hailed the Harlem-born ""culture-changing entertainer."" ""Harry Belafonte was a true mentor and friend. I am heartbroken to hear of his death but inspired by the long, fruitful life he led,"" Sharpton, the host of MSNBC's ""NewsNation,"" said in a statement. ""He was a culture-changing entertainer, a history-changing activist, and an unmatched intellectual. Rest in peace and power, Mr. B."" While Belafonte had worldwide impact, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D- N.Y., said he'll always think of him as a proud New York City native. ""Harry Belafonte was an iconic New Yorker, using his art and activism to disrupt the status quo and fight for justice,"" Bowman said in a statement. ""I was saddened to hear of his passing this morning. New York and the world lost a legend today."" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., posted a picture of him embracing Belafonte. ""Harry Belafonte was not only a great entertainer, but he was a courageous leader in the fight against racism and worker oppression,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""Jane and I were privileged to consider him a friend and will miss him very much."" The noted academic Cornel West said he was saddened by the passing of ""my very dear brother."" He lauded Belafonte's ""artistic genius, moral courage"" and ""loving soul."" Apple CEO Tim Cook also took note of Belafonte's passing and mourned the loss of ""a true giant."" ""Harry Belafonte was a barrier breaker who helped reshape our world through his civil rights advocacy, his music, and his acting,"" Cook said in a statement, which included a picture of Belafonte speaking at a street rally. ""May he rest in peace."" The Muslim American activist Linda Sarsour, who is 53 years Belafonte's junior, celebrated his long life and thanked him for the role he played in her life. ""Rest in power, Mr. B,"" she wrote. ""You lived a long and purposeful life, but still I mourn today. Thank you for believing in me."" Belafonte's impact was even felt all the way down on Sesame Street, where he and Count von Count once sang a song about tallying up coconuts. "
"Elena Reygadas, named world's best female chef, cooks in rhythm with nature",Albinson Linares,"April 24, 2023, 10:55 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"MEXICO CITY — Elena Reygadas' days start early, which explains why she laughs remembering that everything was ""dark"" when she found out she'd been named best female chef in the world in the The World’s 50 Best Restaurants 2023 awards. “I did not expect it and it has been a very nice surprise;  it is very exciting to obtain recognition like this. I want to share it with my entire team; there are many of us in the kitchen and it is always a collective act,"" Reygadas, 46, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo at Rosetta, her first and signature restaurant, which she opened in 2010 in an old mansion in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. Over a decade later, the world-renowned restaurant is where Reygadas has dedicated herself to reconfiguring the vast culinary wealth of her country, menu by menu. “The menu is based on the timeline and the ingredients that nature gives us. Right now, for example, we have a dish with Manila mango that only lasts a little while. We are also using a lot of muscatel plum, which is a moment and when it’s over, it’s over,” said Reygadas, who was named Latin America’s best female chef in the 2014 awards. “It makes us sad because we became very attached to the ingredients, but that also allows us to continue our creativity and move into a new moment.” On Wednesday morning, before Rosetta opened to the public, the aromas of Mexican herbs and vegetables such as hoja santa, romeritos and avocados mingled with powerful hints of spices and, of course, chiles, which are at the heart of many of Reygadas' signature dishes. When asked the secret of Rosetta’s success, she credits that emphasis on ""biodiversity."" “It’s a factor that also has its challenges, because sometimes people who visit us are already in love with a dish but, when they arrive, it is gone and they don’t like that,” Reygadas said. “So changing the menu to respect nature’s times is also a challenge at the diners’ level."" Vegetables play a leading role in many of Reygadas' signature dishes, such as beetroot tartare al pastor, smoked cheese tortelloni with hoja santa — a Mexican herb — and the famous kale with pistachio pipián, or mole sauce, and romeritos (wild herbs) tacos. “I am convinced that the vegetable side of the kitchen and the ingredients of Mexico are wonderful; they are exceptional flavors and there are many to explore. That is why we are increasingly focusing more on the vegetable,"" she said. Despite her university degree in English literature, the Mexican-born Reygadas gravitated to cooking, studying at the French Culinary Institute in New York and then working for four years at one of London's top restaurants, the Michelin-rated Locanda Locatelli. A sample of the notable influence of Mediterranean food in her work are signature dishes such as potato gnocchi, which she prepares with Mexican huitlacoche, or corn mushroom. “I still have a lot of love for Italian cuisine because of its simplicity, its purity, and the use of ingredients in a respectful way. But, today, Rosetta’s kitchen is 100% focused on ingredients and products from Mexico,” the chef said. “I’m working on an epazote paste. Let’s see how it turns out,” she said playfully, referring to an herb widely used in traditional Mexican cooking. When asked why she thinks that Mexico's food is so fashionable right now, Reygadas credits the country's culinary history and its evolution. ""It's not just that we live from pre-Hispanic cuisine,"" said Reygadas, referring to the region's Indigenous foods before Spanish colonization, ""but there is also the contemporary cuisine of other chefs and cooks, perhaps the best in the city, who have traveled, who have been influenced by other cultures, other techniques and other ingredients. I feel that our past and present come together, and that makes us unique."" Reygadas has been recognized for advancing the work of female chefs. When asked how ""macho"" the culinary world is, she said there's ""a lot to do."" ""When I was trained, the truth is that many times I was the only woman in the kitchen and the women were almost always in the desserts,"" she said. ""However, for example, here in Rosetta we have a lot of women and I see more and more."" Reygadas tries “to avoid the kitchen being so hierarchical, where sometimes there is a bad vibe,” she said. “I don’t like that stereotype of the typical chef who yells. I’m not like that.” Apart from Rosetta, Reygadas operates other establishments in Mexico City: the  popular Rosetta Bakery, which also sells bread to other restaurants;  Lardo, a casual Mexican restaurant; and Café Nin, a bistro. Despite the intense work managing four restaurants employing over 400 people, she’s also written a series of short notebooks or essays on food, health and the environment. Food, she wrote, should be seen “as a vital act in which the biological, the social, the economic, the political and the cultural come together.” One of the topics she is vocal about is sustainability, and the recognition of climate change and its impacts. “The truth is very clear in the kitchen,” she said. “Sometimes you have everything very organized with the idea of ​​natural cycles, but suddenly you see that those cycles no longer happen in the normal order. For example, last year we had very few wild mushrooms because rainfall was scarce due to climate change. And that is very sad and serious.” Reygadas credits her family with her early love of cooking; she said with a smile that she was the type of girl who baked cakes to take to friend’s houses. “My two grandmothers were very good cooks, I even have beautiful handwritten recipes for them,” she said. “I think I saw that cooking is a way of giving love, affection and expressing ourselves. I understood that from a very young age.” An earlier version of this story was published in Noticias Telemundo. "
Meghan Trainor apologized for dissing teachers. Some say they’re still upset.,Brahmjot Kaur,"April 24, 2023, 8:43 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Some teachers on TikTok are expressing their disappointment in singer Meghan Trainor, following a comment she made on her podcast that they felt disrespected the profession. The singer generated backlash after she said “F--- teachers” during an episode of “Workin’ On It with Meghan Trainor & Ryan Trainor” released last week. The remark was made during a discussion with guest Trisha Paytas, a controversial influencer, when she explained why she is homeschooling her child. “Teachers of TikTok and teachers of the world, I recently said F teachers on my podcast and it’s not how I feel,” Trainor, 29, said in her apology video posted Sunday. “I was fired up because we were talking about how sending your kid to school here in America is so horrific and what all of us have to go through, but especially teachers, is not normal and is not OK.” The Grammy winner also said she was bullied by teachers in the past, and that experience played into her comment. She said she “love[s]” and “fight[s]” for teachers. A representative for Trainor did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the continued backlash. The clip of Trainor’s initial comment, as well as her apology, quickly circulated on TikTok among educators, many of whom have utilized the platform to vent about burnout and lack of resources in their profession. Many educators have historically dealt with a slew of difficulties in their career, including low pay, pressure to keep students safe during school shootings, disrespect from parents and students, and health concerns from the Covid pandemic. “I think we’ve all heard what Meghan Trainor said about teachers and, as a teacher who puts so much effort into my job, to be disrespected like that is just so frustrating,” kindergarten teacher Kerregan Calhoun said in a TikTok video that has garnered over half a million views. “I work so hard to make school a safe and memorable experience for my kids every week.” Second grade teacher Carina Boltres, who has over 745,000 followers on TikTok, said she is no longer a fan of the artist — and that the apology wasn’t enough. “I don’t accept,” Boltres, who goes by misscarinab on TikTok, said in a response to Trainor’s apology. “... I would love to see the people complaining about teachers do our job for one day.” Another teacher, who goes by fantasticallyfirst, posted a video of herself in a classroom with her arms crossed and wrote the caption “listening to Meghan Trainor’s apology.” “& people wonder why so many amazing teachers are leaving the profession… yes, with the world we are living in schools are 100% a scary place BUT there are so many teachers that will do literally ANYTHING for their students,” she wrote in the caption of the video. “We constantly put ourselves (most of the times at the cost of our own mental/emotional/physical health) because we LOVE our students. Im not saying that the apology wasn’t heard… but this is the exact reason teachers are speaking up & speaking out more. Please pray for us teachers ❤” Some former educators also weighed in. “Something that I told my students when I was teaching is that if you’re making an apology, and that apology contains excuses surrounding why you did the original action, it devalues the apology itself,” Maggie Perkins, who goes by millennialmsfrizzle on TikTok, said in a video response to Trainor. “It makes it less sincere.” Perkins, who left the education field and has a podcast about the perils of teaching, said Trainor has “millions of people” listening to her “so not only was it extremely poor judgment on her part, but anyone involved with her podcast.” The discourse surrounding Trainor's remark spilled over to Twitter. ""Meghan Trainor’s comments about teachers makes me sad. We get the short end of the stick all. the. time,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""As a product of public schools and as an educator for 30+ years in public schools, I find her statement/apology uninformed and demeaning to all of us who pour into our students every single day our love,knowledge,money and souls,"" wrote another user.

Ada Limón is the first U.S. poet laureate appointed to a two-year second term,Edwin Flores,"April 24, 2023, 7:54 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The award-winning Mexican American poet Ada Limón has been reappointed as the nation’s poet laureate, the first time a laureate will serve a two-year second term instead of the traditional one-year option. Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress, said in announcing the appointment that in her first term, Limón ""has done so much to broaden and promote poetry to reach new audiences."" ""She also laid the groundwork for multiple laureate outreach efforts to come, many with federal agencies,” Hayden said. “A two-year second term gives the laureate and the Library the opportunity to realize these efforts and showcase how poems connect to, and make sense of, the world around us.” Limón, who became the nation's 24th poet laureate last September, will unveil a poem on June 1 that will be engraved on NASA’s spacecraft that will travel 1.8 billion miles to explore Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, a part of the Europa Clipper mission. After Limón starts her second term in September, the Library will announce in August details of her signature project — a partnership with the National Park Service and the Poetry Society of America to present poems in featured national parks to expose more people to poetry, and laureate initiatives with federal and nonfederal partners. “I am beyond honored to serve for another two years as the Poet Laureate of the United States,” Limón said in a statement. “Everywhere I have traveled during my first term, both nationally and internationally, I’ve been reminded that poetry brings people together. I am looking forward to continuing the important work of celebrating what poetry can do.” Limón is the first female U.S. poet laureate of Latino and Mexican American heritage. She told NBC News last July that poetry was a way to “reclaim our humanity,” a way to help repair our relationship with the planet. She said that she wanted to see more poems in public venues, including in pocket parks in urban spaces, “when you’re walking the dog, at the bus stop.” Limón is the author of six poetry books, including “The Carrying,”  published in 2018 and winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for poetry, and 2015's “Bright Dead Things,” which was a National Book Award finalist. Her latest book, “The Hurting Kind,” was published last May as part of a three-book deal with Milkweed Editions. Limón, who grew up in Sonoma, California, lives in Kentucky. Her second term as poet laureate ends in April 2025. "
Why everyone online is calling these Hollywood men 'babygirl',Kalhan Rosenblatt,"April 23, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Online, the “Succession” character Kendall Roy has been described as many things: depressed, desperate for attention, cringe. But to his die-hard following, Kendall — played by Jeremy Strong — is just “babygirl.” In internet speak, that descriptor isn’t a pejorative. The term has been repurposed by fans online to label their favorite men (fictional or real). “Babygirl,” often written as one word, has risen in popularity as a descriptor not for little girls, but for male actors and male-presenting characters. In recent months, “babygirl” has become a catchall term that applies to a range of men: Some have used the word to describe a man they perceive as vulnerable and submissive, while others use it to describe brooding, surly men. Because ""the exact metrics of what makes a man a babygirl [are] seemingly still loose,"" according to meme database Know Your Meme, a succinct definition of the word as it is used on social media doesn't exist. The term has been applied to actor Pedro Pascal, as well as Joel, the character he plays on the HBO show “The Last of Us.” It has also been used to describe the vulnerability of actor Paul Mescal and the quirkiness of actor Willem Dafoe. These are just some of the many men who have been deemed ""babygirl."" “girls be like ‘he’s so babygirl’ and it’s the darkest, most brooding, melancholic, tortured man you’ve ever laid eyes on,” one person tweeted. “Babygirl” has been used in its current context since at least 2021, but its popularity has only continued to grow, according to Phillip Hamilton, an editor for Know Your Meme. In 2023, “babygirl” exploded on social media, often tied to the airing of episodes of popular television, and entered the internet’s mainstream vocabulary. Some experts also note that “babygirl” marks an interesting milestone in the linguistics of the internet, in which a feminine term is applied to a male figure in a way that isn’t pejorative or derogatory. Sylvia Sierra, an assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University, said that sexism and misogyny are at the root of why heteronormative men often balk at being called a feminine term. “Babygirl” might be different. Typically, there’s “negative valence attached to these terms for women. ... With ‘babygirl,’ you’re not seeing that. It actually is being used in like a positive way, like you’re highlighting favorable qualities in a man,” said Sierra, who has a doctorate in linguistics from Georgetown University. Social media accelerates the spread — and in some cases the acceptance — of gender-defying words and terms, Sierra said. But, she said, it’s not impossible for a phrase like “babygirl” to take off in real life. It’s unclear who coined “babygirl” as a term for men; Know Your Meme’s first documented case of the phrase being directed at men is in a 2017 post on Wattpad, a free platform where people write stories. From there, the term grew on sites like Tumblr and was predominantly used in fandoms to describe male characters. Hamilton suggested there is humor in the incongruity between the term and the men to whom “babygirl” is applied. He added that many of the men called “babygirl” look like they would take offense if they found out they were being called the term online. “It’s like the opposite of what a typical sort of manly man kind of guy might want to be called, right?” he said. “But online that kind of works.” For Leila Loiza, 23, a Twitter user who has tweeted about both Kendall Roy and actor Charlie Day from “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” being “babygirl,” the shift in language to be more inclusive and gender-fluid is exciting. “It’s a shift into terms that are used toward a more feminine audience and are now being opened up to a more masculine audience,” Loiza said. “So it’s a new step up in gender-neutral terms.” Loiza said she began using the term earlier this year, although she recalled that actor Shemar Moore’s catchphrase of “baby girl” on the show “Criminal Minds,” where he played Derek Morgan, was also popular on social media. Twitter user Din M’Rini, 25, described Pascal as the original “babygirl.” But she noted that the current king “babygirl” is Kendall Roy. M’Rini said seeing language evolve online to have a more positive spin on feminine words that are applied to men is “beautiful.” She said she’s also looking forward to if and when “babygirl” takes the leap from social media term to real-life compliment. “I cannot wait to see like the day in which I’m at the gym or something, and like some gym bro next to me says like, ‘Oh, he’s so babygirl.’” "
"Are Brazilians Hispanic? Many say ‘yes,’ report says",Associated Press,"April 19, 2023, 7:00 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"A coding error in an annual survey by the U.S. Census Bureau has offered unprecedented insight into how large numbers of Brazilians in the U.S. identify as Hispanic. An analysis by Pew Research Center shows that the coding mistake revealed at least 416,000 Brazilians, or more than two-thirds of Brazilians in the U.S., identifying as Hispanic in the 2020 American Community Survey. By comparison, only 14,000 Brazilians identified that way in 2019, and only 16,000 Brazilians did so in 2021 — years when the coding error wasn’t made. Since 2000, the Census Bureau hasn’t classified Brazilians and other people from non-Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America and the Caribbean as Hispanic because of federal government definitions that were last revised in 1997 but are being reconsidered for an update next year. Because of this, if someone marks that they are Hispanic but Brazilian on the survey, they are recoded as “not Hispanic” when the numbers are crunched. In 2020, however, the bureau inadvertently failed to make those recoding changes for Brazilians, as well as people from Portugal, the Philippines and non-Spanish-speaking countries in Latin American and the Caribbean, resulting in an additional 471,000 people who identified as Hispanic in 2020 compared to 2021, Pew said. More than 62 million people identified as Hispanic in the 2021 American Community Survey. “In particular, the large number of Brazilians who self-identified as Hispanic or Latino highlights how their views of their own identity does not necessarily align with official government definitions,” Pew said in a report released Wednesday. “It also underscores that being Hispanic means different things to different people.” There were more than 526,000 Brazilians in the U.S. in 2021, with more than a fifth living in Florida, according to the American Community Survey. Using different criteria, the Pew report puts the number of Brazilians in the U.S. at 602,000 people. "
"Paralympics TikTok account slammed as insensitive, but not all Paralympians are taking offense",Brahmjot Kaur,"April 19, 2023, 5:47 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"The Paralympics Games official TikTok has prompted outrage among some users who said the account's use of popular memes and audio, coupled with footage of athletes, appears to mock the Paralympians. The account, which has over 3 million followers, posts highlight reels of athletes in different sports during the Paralympics — a major international multisport event for athletes with physical disabilities or intellectual impairments. The videos often use popular sounds like “bop it” while showing how blind swimmers avoid hitting the pool wall with a tap on the head or “do a flip” while athletes fall over during wheelchair rugby — an aggressive and full-contact sport previously called murderball. “the paralympics tiktok account is honestly so mean … like all they do is make fun of the athletes and don’t actually highlight any of their achievements and it’s so gross,” wrote one Twitter user. “Is anyone super uncomfortable that the entire Paralympics TikTok account is just made to be some sort of huge joke or is that just me?” one TikToker said in their video. A spokesperson for the International Paralympic Committee said the account is run by a Paralympian. “We have created a strong following through edgy and unique content that allows us to educate an audience who might be less aware of Paralympic sport and the achievements of our athletes,” the spokesperson said in an email statement. “We appreciate that not everyone will like the content and sometimes we don’t get it right, but we do closely monitor posts and always converse in reactions to them. Importantly, we find that the account allows us to positively engage with younger fans about the power of Para sport as a tool for driving social inclusion.” Backlash online began after a video of Australian cyclist Darren Hick recirculated on Twitter after being posted by Barstool Sports. The video, which shows Hicks winning gold during the Men’s paracycling C2 time trial at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics, uses audio saying “left” multiple times from the song “Follow the Leader” by The Soca Boys. We appreciate that not everyone will like the content and sometimes we don’t get it right, but we do closely monitor posts and always converse in reactions to them."" — A spokesperson for the International Paralympic Committee When reached for comment by NBC News, some Paralympians featured in videos posted by the account said they did not feel offended by its contents. Hicks said he wasn’t aware of the tweet from Barstool Sports but didn’t see the problem in the original video. “I don’t feel like they are mocking me, rather just using a song which uses the word left, and I happen to be pedaling with only my left leg,” he said in a message to NBC News. Andre Ramos, a bronze medalist in boccia, was also featured on the Paralympics TikTok account. The video shows Ramos, who has cerebral palsy, using his left foot to play the sport with a viral sound of someone singing “Hey, what?” during a game of boccia — a modified version of boccie for people in wheelchairs played at the Paralympics. Ramos, who is from Portugal, said he doesn’t see an issue with the video. “In my opinion, it does not demonstrate any type of offense. Many people may think so, but it’s because they are not used to having contact with people with disabilities,” he said. “Making fun with our handicaps is a sign that we accept ourselves as we are and that others do not see the disability as a difference.” Imani Barbarin, a disability rights advocate who was among those sharing their opinion about the TikTok account, said she recognizes that the account is run by a Paralympian. But she believes there are better ways to promote the Paralympics. “When you pair some of these audios against physically disabled people, the context changes and it becomes more mocking. You cannot just apply audio from TikTok to videos of Paralympic athletes,” she said. “I’m sorry. It’s just it does not work the same way. And I think that they have this desire to go viral more than to create a sustainable audience of supporters.” Instead, she said the Paralympics account could feature interviews with the Paralympic athletes, or people explaining the rules for different sports and what the qualification process is like. “Not everybody who is a disabled person or even a Paralympian is going to necessarily be good at asserting a voice or a perspective when it comes to the things that an audience of disabled people want to see,” she said. “There are a ton of comments that are like, ‘I’m going to hell for laughing’ and if that’s the main core of the responses you’re getting to the media you’re creating, I personally think that’s an issue.” "
"Pitcher Anthony Bass claims flight attendant asked his pregnant wife to clean up after their child, fueling heated Twitter debate",David K. Li,"April 18, 2023, 4:49 PM UTC / Updated April 19, 2023, 1:26 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Anthony Bass lashed out at United Airlines, claiming a flight attendant forced his pregnant wife to clean up a midair mess left by their toddler daughter. The Twitter-fueled dust-up started Sunday with the first of several tweets by Bass complaining that his 22-weeks’ pregnant wife was made to ""get on her hands and knees to pick up the popcorn mess left by my youngest daughter."" Bass is married to Sydney Rae James, the sister of country singer Jessie James Decker. Decker also chimed in, via a since-expired Instagram story, saying that her sister is going through a high-risk pregnancy and that she texted her from the plane about the popcorn spill, according to NBC Los Angeles and Access Hollywood. ""My poor sister is on her hands and knees crying in the aisle, completely humiliated and exhausted with her children, while everyone else watched,"" Decker reportedly wrote. But if Bass was seeking online sympathy, then he misread the virtual room as he squared off with netizens who didn't take his side. In the face of the Twitter backlash, Bass insisted he and his family are in the right and even hinted that their complaints have prompted United to take action against the flight attendant. He did an online bat flip by posting a picture of his daughter with a bag of popcorn. The same picture was posted on his wife's Instagram feed Monday, drawing a humorous response from Decker, the child's aunt, who wrote: ""The popcorn hazard."" Representatives for United Airlines could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents United crew members, said in a statement Tuesday that its members and travelers share the same space: ""We want this space to serve the needs of everyone on the plane and that takes strict safety rules and a recognition that we’re sharing the aircraft cabin to do something we can’t do alone."" But the union declined to specifically address Bass' complaint. ""It wouldn’t be a day in aviation without a raging debate on Twitter over an event in the air, even if we don’t have all of the facts,"" the union said. ""Our experience tells us that commenting on this specific incident without all of the information likely won’t help."" Florida-based etiquette consultant Jacqueline Whitmore, a former flight attendant, said it'd be ""unprofessional"" for in-flight crew to ask a passenger to clean up his or her own mess. ""We don't know the flight attendant's side. All we know is what Anthony Bass tweeted ... but the fact that this flight attendant might have said 'Get on your hands and knees and clean that up' is not only unprofessional, but it's unbelievable,"" said Whitmore, who was a Northwest Airlines flight attendant in the 1990s. Whitmore, who founded The Protocol School of Palm Beach, which consults on issues of corporate etiquette, still urged travelers to be considerate and mindful of a plane’s condition when they leave it. ""It is the responsibility of every passenger, regardless of age, to pack their manners and clean up after themselves,"" she said. Bass, 35, has spent time with the San Diego Padres, the Texas Rangers, the Miami Marlins, the Chicago Cubs, the Seattle Mariners and the Houston Astros, and he is now on his second tour of duty in Toronto. He's off to a difficult start in this young season, having surrendered 11 hits and six earned runs in just 7-1/3 innings. Bass' wife did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment Tuesday. "
A new cooking show breaks down borders through food,Edwin Flores,"April 18, 2023, 1:25 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"For Emmanuel Gonzalez Perez, the Mexican dish carne en su jugo — meat in its juices — is a reminder of the home he hasn't been able to return to in over 20 years. Gonzalez Perez, 27, of Sacramento, California, has taken his family’s recipe to “No Borders, Just Flavors!” — a YouTube cooking competition. Produced by United We Dream, the country’s largest youth-led immigrant advocacy network, the coming show pits a young immigrant cast competing against one another as they showcase family recipes. Contestants from first- and second-generation immigrant backgrounds prepare meals from their families’ heritages, including salted egg tofu, a common delicacy in China and Indonesia, Indian panchmel dal (lentils) and seco de pollo (chicken stew), which is common in Ecuadorian and Peruvian cuisine. For Gonzalez Perez, crafting the meal with its flavorful bacon, beans and broth with blended tomatillos is one of the few ways he can connect to his mainland and family. “Even though we’re so far away, we’re still able to at least eat the same food with the same taste,"" he said. United We Dream has been one of the country’s most visible organizations pushing for young immigrants' rights, credited with applying pressure for government action that culminated in President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows immigrants brought to the U.S. as children but without legal status to work and study without fear of being deported. “I think that we take for granted that food is a medium of storytelling. There’s history behind almost every dish that we eat. … Food is a space for storytelling, and it’s also a space for meaning-making and identity-making,” said executive producer Juanita Monsalve, a senior creative director at United We Dream. The production was intended to show and share diverse immigrant stories that don’t center on tragedy and hardship. It is meant to spotlight stories of joy, courage and wisdom, she said. It’s also a pioneering YouTube entertainment show, created and distributed by an advocacy organization, according to Monsalve. “I think that unlike other cooking shows, the show doesn’t ask people to hold a part of themselves back. And so we brought a diverse set of people with unique experiences and asked them to share all forms or all aspects of their identities through their cooking,” she said. Contestants cook dishes based on specific categories and are judged by the host, Morelys De Los Santos Urbano, an Afro Dominican college student who founded an organization at Morgan State University to support undocumented students like her — one of the first groups of its kind at an HBCU (historically Black college and university). Other judges include guest TikTok food content creators and chefs. The contestants have 90 minutes to complete their concoctions. Winning dishes are selected based on flavor, presentation and storytelling. Contestants are able to sabotage their competitors by choosing to hit a “dance-off button,” requiring contestants to stop cooking and dance for three minutes. Or they’re able to request help by hitting the “teamwork button,” and their competitors will help on their own dishes for three minutes. Gonzalez Perez, a community assistant at the Weber Institute of Applied Sciences & Technology high school in Stockton, California, is featured in the first episode. Originally from Guadalajara in the Mexican state of Jalisco, Gonzalez Perez is a DACA recipient. Under the program, he can travel back to his home country with “advance parole” only for educational, employment or urgent humanitarian purposes. Gonzalez Perez said he grew up a big fan of cooking shows but didn’t see much diversity reflected in them. By being able to participate in the show, he was able to learn other cultures through his competitors' stories and dishes. “I think the show does an amazing [job] in showcasing our humanity, our identity, and I think this should serve as a point for people to really [be] able to start connecting with other communities. Sometimes we tend to only eat our own food or stay within our own culture,” he said. Monsalve has been working to humanize immigrant stories for six years. She also produced “Home is Here,” a nine-part documentary shorts series that was submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court as the first digital amicus (friend of the court) brief in support of the immigrant rights movement, which helped build support to protect DACA. The show’s four 15-minute episodes were filmed in Houston by a diverse crew in December. Episodes will premiere at 8 p.m. ET Thursdays on YouTube starting Thursday. "
Tweets that called out 'Beef' star David Choe for self-proclaimed 'rapey behavior' are removed,Kimmy Yam,"April 17, 2023, 11:15 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Posts calling out “Beef” star David Choe and sharing the 2014 podcast clip in which he detailed self-proclaimed “rapey behavior” have been taken down from Twitter since criticism renewed this month. The tweets included clips from a 2014 episode of his now-defunct podcast, “DVDASA,” and were removed from Twitter on Sunday after they were labeled with a “report from the copyright holder” notice. The clips included Choe’s telling a graphic story about a masseuse that has been criticized as describing rape and sexual assault. He later asserted that the story was a fabrication. An email obtained by NBC News, sent from Twitter and addressed to Meecham Whitson Meriweather — one of two social media users whose tweets were removed — listed Choe as the copyright holder and party who had requested the takedown. In the request, included in the email, Choe wrote that the clips had been shared “without our consent.” “We would like to have these videos removed immediately,” said the request, which specifically cited tweets from Meriweather and fellow Twitter user Aura Bogado. Neither Twitter nor Choe responded to requests for comment. After the controversial podcast in 2014, Choe denied the story, saying in a statement that the podcast is “a complete extension of my art.” “I never thought I’d wake up one late afternoon and hear myself called a rapist. It sucks. Especially because I am not one. I am not a rapist. I hate rapists,” he wrote in the 2014 statement. Multiple news outlets at the time reported on his response, which was posted on the podcast’s now-defunct website. The Twitter email, which also listed the David Young Choe Foundation as Choe’s company, informed Meriweather that his tweet had been taken down because of a “DMCA takedown notice,” a reference to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which protects copyright holders from online theft. However, several Twitter users said the tweets’ removal was an attempt by Choe to scrub the internet of his past. Meriweather, a New York City-based culture writer, said he had been following “Beef” since it was released April 6. He saw the clip when it was first posted by Bogado, a senior reporter at the Center for Investigative Reporting. Meriweather wrote in the now-removed tweet that the woman who was in the room during the episode, Asa Akira, called Choe out several times, telling him the behavior he described was rape, “allegedly.” Meriweather said he was disappointed in the handling of the controversy, adding that the tweets’ removal is an example of silencing those condemning problematic behavior. “It’s just so strange to me,” he said. “We are no longer believing our eyes and our ears when it’s right in front of us.” Since the show’s release, many have questioned its decision to cast Choe. Choe previously said on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast that co-stars Steven Yeun and Ali Wong had presented him with the opportunity to be in the series, which marked his first major foray into acting. “Waiting to hear why @aliwong and @steveyeun made a decision to give Choe this platform,” Bogado wrote. “Silence really speaks volumes.” Neither Yeun nor Wong responded to requests for comment. And as of Monday, Wong’s Twitter account had been set to private. Neither Netflix nor A24, the studio that produced the series, responded, either. Bogado also did not respond to a request for comment. Choe’s comments have been the subject of criticism in the past, as well. In 2017, a mural he painted in Manhattan was vandalized. And among the messages tagged on it was the word “rapist.” Choe apologized for the remarks in a statement on Instagram, writing that he has “ZERO history of sexual assault.” “In a 2014 episode of [‘DVDASA’] I relayed a story simply for shock value that made it seem as if I had sexually violated a woman. Though I said those words, I did not commit those actions. It did not happen,” he said. “I am deeply sorry for any hurt I’ve brought to anyone through my past words.” Meriweather said he hopes the show will act, but he also acknowledged that there is a layered conversation to be had. “I think there’s really only one way to go about it … which is to take accountability and then move forward without him,” Meriweather said. “The thing is that everyone knew. It was complicity. How do you really move forward with that when you are part of the problem?” "
"Few universities offer majors in Latino, Black, Asian or Indigenous studies, a new report shows",Suzanne Gamboa,"April 17, 2023, 10:15 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The political uproar over racial and ethnic studies programs in higher education is clouding the reality that few four-year institutions offer a major in Latino studies. Such small numbers also are the reality with majors in the study of other racial and ethnic groups. A major in Latino studies is offered by just 89 of more than 2,600 four-year colleges and universities, according to a new report by The Latinx Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Further, the majority of those programs, most established after the Mexican American and Puerto Rican student movements of the 1960s and 1970s, are dramatically underfunded and understaffed, with many having one or no core tenure-track faculty in the program, the researchers found. Just 252 four-year higher education institutions, or 9%, offer an African American or a Black studies major; 52, or 2%, offer an Asian American studies major; 74 or 3% offer a Native American studies major; and 146 or 5% offer a broader Ethnic Studies major, the Berkley research released this month found. Given those numbers, the turmoil over ethnic studies seems “overblown,” said G. Cristina Mora, the study’s lead author. “We are far from having an equitable higher education system that offers the classes and research opportunities on all communities, and at the same time, it’s quite ironic that these nascent and vulnerable programs are targeted because they are somehow taking over,” she added. “Lack of investment in Latino studies is really a willful blindness as we move into the future,” she said. Conservative fears over the study of white supremacy’s role in the making of the U.S. and its persistence in American institutions have led to campaigns to narrow ethnic studies instruction. But Latino and other racial and ethnic studies not only tell the stories of respective communities, but also are critical to collecting demographic data, Mora said. Students in programs with classes on Latino demographics, Mora said, gain better understanding of why some cities are growing at a faster rate than others. Through Latino politics classes, students learn to better understand Latino political trends and how they differ from one state to the next, she said. Nonetheless, the teaching of accomplishments, histories, demographics, culture and more of Latino, Black, Asian and Native Americans and others has become a magnet for political vitriol and a conservative clampdown. In Florida — where nearly 6 million or more than a quarter of residents are Latino — a House bill aims to curtail teaching about race and the histories of Latinos and others. The bill is based on the political wish list of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to be a 2024 Republican presidential candidate. Texas has also targeted racial and ethnic studies and their instructors, even though  Latinos outnumber every other racial group in the state, including non-Hispanic white people. Critics of ethnic studies seem to be “operating on a caricature of what this intellectual study is,” Mora said. Mora said she and her fellow researchers launched their study to see if universities have been keeping pace. The U.S. has some 62 million Latinos whose backgrounds range from those with deep roots in regions that were part of Spain and Mexico before they were U.S. states, to descendants of enslaved people exported to Latin America, to recent arrivals in the country. More than half of the nation’s growth in 2020 was driven by Latinos, while the white population numbers have shrunk. The Latino population’s younger makeup means it is providing a steady stream of college-age Americans and will do so for years to come. That trend is reflected in the increase in Hispanic Serving Institutions, or HSIs, which numbered 571 in 2021-22. HSIs are two- and four-year institutions with 25% or more full-time, enrolled students are Hispanic or Latino. Latino enrollment at all four-year institutions has been increasing over the past couple of decades. Mora said they expected to find some growth in the hiring of Latino faculty and investment in Latino studies. She said, however, that they were “alarmed” by how flat the trends have been. Their research also showed that most of the growth of Latino studies programs is happening at private universities. Some of the newer programs appear to be “shell” programs when it comes to staffing and classes. Half of those established since 2000s have none or one faculty member. Often some of the newer programs rely on a lecturer or an adjunct professor to run the program, she said. The researchers found several programs offered only Spanish-language classes — even though a substantial share of U.S. Latinos don’t speak Spanish fluently, according to Mora. Latino Studies grew out of a community imperative, the result of strikes and demands that academia reflect “our histories and stories, which is the story of all ethnic studies,” Mora said. The first universities to form Latino studies programs were public land grant universities in the West and Southwest with strong investment. But the growth of Latino studies programs stagnated in the 1980s and 1990s and jump-started again in the 2000s, with some new programs in the Midwest, following Latino demographic trends, Mora said. “We don’t suggest that everyone has to major in Latino studies, but we do suggest that Latino studies is a really important course of intellectual understanding that helps all students and all Americans,” she said. “The way I see Latino studies, I see a real opportunity for diverse understandings of where we have come from to better understand where we are going,” Mora said. “Latino communities aren’t going anywhere. They are just becoming a much more important part of the country.” "
Rapper E-40 says 'racial bias' was reason he was ejected from Warriors-Kings playoff game,The Associated Press,"April 17, 2023, 12:16 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The Sacramento Kings are investigating allegations from a Bay Area hip-hop star that “racial bias” led to him being kicked out of his seat during a playoff game against the Golden State Warriors. The rapper E-40 said in a statement that he was heckled throughout the game Saturday night and addressed one heckler “in an assertive but polite manner” before security guards came and ordered him to leave the arena. “Unfortunately, it was yet another reminder that — despite my success and accolades as a musician and entrepreneur — racial bias remains prevalent,” he said in a statement. “Security saw a disagreement between a Black man and a white woman and immediately assumed that I was at fault.” The Kings said they are investigating the circumstances behind the ejection. “The Sacramento Kings take these claims seriously and are investigating the facts and circumstances regarding the situation, as we do anytime an accusation like this is made,” the team said in a statement. E-40 is a prominent Warriors fan and was even part of the delegation that visited the White House earlier this season. “It’s unfortunate,” Warriors guard Klay Thompson said. “I love 40. He’s been our biggest supporter for years. I hope they right that ship because he deserves to be there by our bench. In my time knowing him, he’s always been respectful. He’s always been considerate of those around him. Very weird to see, and I hope it’s resolved.” E-40 is known for his collaborations with other artists, including on songs such as “I Don’t (Expletive) With You” with Big Sean, “Snap Yo Fingers” with Lil Jon and Sean Paul of YoungBloodZ, and “U And Dat” with T-Pain and Kandi Girl.

Netflix apologizes after livestream of 'Love Is Blind' reunion is delayed for many,Dennis Romero,"April 17, 2023, 4:25 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"Streaming giant Netflix apologized Sunday night after the livestream for a reunion of its dating show ""Love Is Blind"" was delayed for more than an hour for many subscribers. Netflix said it was trying to make the show available to subscribers, albeit as a recorded product that would no longer be live. ""To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon… we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned,"" it tweeted. It gave subscribers cause for more fear of missing out. ""We're filming it now and we'll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible,"" it said. ""Again, thank you and sorry."" ""Live Is Blind,"" Netflix's first dating reality show, matches couples by having them get to know each other from the privacy of ""pods,"" in which the one thing they don't discover is what their suitors look like. That happens later, and, of course, hilarity ensues. ""Love Is Blind"" released a fourth season of content in March, with the suitors based in Seattle this time. The reunion livestream was an opportunity to bring diehard fans into the product; Netflix promised to integrate viewers' questions, to be answered by the show's lovers. Online voting, available Thursday, determined which questions would be answered. It's not clear whether  the delay affected the Q&A. The delay was fodder for social media, where viewers lambasted Netflix for botching the second livestream event in its history. ""We deserve to all share the same password after this,"" said Twitter user Trina Watters. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, said the show's lifesaver of a seamstress, known to rescue a suitor just before a date by repairing clothing malfunctions, should be summoned. ""Someone call Lucia the seamstress to fix this,"" she tweeted. ""I believe in her."" In March, a live comedy special, ""Chris Rock: Selective Outrage,"" became the streamer's first such presentation. It went off without such disruption, although there were delays for some viewers. "
A YouTube stage mom faces abuse allegations from 11 teens in court case,Kat Tenbarge,"April 16, 2023, 4:00 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The mother of a teen YouTube star will face claims of emotional, physical and sexual abuse from 11 teen content creators who were featured on her daughter’s channel in a trial that starts Monday. The court proceedings will offer a rare glimpse into the lucrative and largely unregulated world of child YouTube stardom. All of the teen plaintiffs allege in the complaint, filed in January 2022, that Tiffany Smith, the mother of YouTube star Piper Rockelle, intentionally inflicted emotional distress while she held a position of “care and control” over them in the production of content for Rockelle’s YouTube channel. The teen creators allege that they endured physical and emotional injuries from “harassment, molestation, and abuse,” according to the complaint. In addition, some of the plaintiffs say they weren’t compensated for the use of their likenesses to promote Rockelle’s content, and all of them say they weren’t paid for their work and appearances, though they say they weren’t promised payment. Some of the allegations against Smith have repeatedly piqued interest of concerned outsiders, offering a glimpse into the “Wild West” world of YouTube child stardom. YouTube itself doesn’t take responsibility for the offscreen conduct of its creators, and there are surprisingly few regulations around the creation of social media content involving children. Instead, the teens are each asking for roughly $2 million in damages, totaling at least $22 million, from Smith and her boyfriend, Hunter Hill, who the complaint identifies as the director and editor of Rockelle’s YouTube channel. The plaintiffs were all once a part of 15-year-old Piper Rockelle’s “Piper Squad,” and were featured on her YouTube channel, which has over 10 million subscribers. Children and young teenagers make up the cast of the “Squad,” and their relationships and antics are broadcast to millions of viewers. Despite their age, the plaintiffs said they were asked to stage romantic “crushes” on each other, meant to fool young audiences. According to the complaint and former “Squad” members’ mothers, six of whom talked to NBC News, the dynamics of the “Squad” and romantic storylines have led to issues like online bullying and harassment of their children. The complaint and the mothers say Smith has left their children reeling from trauma. “I just want peace back with my kids,” said Ashley Anne-Rock Smith, whose two daughters, both plaintiffs, are Rockelle’s cousins and appeared in 94 videos on her channel. “I want all predators who hurt young kids to be brought to justice,” she said. “I also hope we move the needle on these platforms that are allowing this.” YouTube did not immediately return a request for comment. In July, Smith countersued for $30 million and accused the plaintiffs’ mothers of conspiring to extort money by making false sexual abuse allegations. Smith voluntarily abandoned the lawsuit before the mothers responded, and Matthew Sarelson, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, called the lawsuit “baseless.” An attorney for Smith did not respond to a request for comment. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times published in December, Smith said she didn’t consider herself the plaintiffs’ employer at the time the videos were filmed with Rockelle. Smith has since acquired a permit to work with minors, she told the Times. In the 147-page complaint, the plaintiffs described Smith as a “mean-spirited control freak” and alleged she made comments about children’s genitalia, shouted obscene and sexually graphic remarks at them, encouraged them to be “sexy” and “sexually aggressive” in videos, and inappropriately touched the children on their legs, thighs and buttocks. One plaintiff said Smith told her she was mailing Rochelle’s underwear to a man who liked to “sniff” it. “As children, they don’t understand it, sometimes it goes over their heads,” said Steevy Areeco, the mother of another plaintiff. “But now they’re older and they’re starting to understand the trauma that was caused, the things that were said to them, these fake crushes.” Areeco and some of the other parents and plaintiffs had experience in traditional media before joining the “Squad.” Sarelson, the attorney, told NBC News that the guidelines for child actors on TV and movie sets don’t apply for nontraditional filming environments, like YouTube. Areeco said that the “Squad” wasn’t acting, since Smith wanted “real reactions” from the children and would “force them to live these adult situations they shouldn’t have been put in.” “We all love YouTube and it’s a great place, but when somebody is using it as a business and pulling other children in, those people should have to uphold a certain standard,” Areeco said. “We want there to be protections for the children.” YouTube demonetized Rockelle’s channel in February 2022, after Insider sent the platform a request for comment about the lawsuit filed against Smith. That means the channel no longer makes money from ads. Rockelle makes money by selling merchandise and is currently on tour in the U.S. to perform music and meet fans. According to the lawsuit, in addition to not getting paid, nine of the plaintiffs alleged that Smith and Hill “sabotaged” their YouTube channels after they left the “Squad” by falsely flagging their content as inappropriate and embedding their content on pornographic websites so they would be “deemed ‘restricted’” by YouTube. The nine plaintiffs said Smith and Hill owe them at least $2 million in lost earnings from YouTube. “They lost their childhood,” Sarelson said of his clients. “Several of my clients have removed themselves from the world of social media because they had this bad experience.” Even before the lawsuit was filed, Smith and the parents of former “Squad” members pursued legal action against each other, and Rockelle became part of tabloid headlines. In September 2021, YouTube removed three of Rockelle’s thumbnail images for violating its Child Safety Policy shortly after the singer P!nk tweeted that Rockelle was being “exploited” by her mother. At the time, both Rockelle and Smith responded that there was nothing wrong with the photos, with Smith telling outlets through a representative that she wanted to “protect” and support her daughter. In April 2020, Smith sued one “Squad” parent who isn’t a party to the current lawsuit for defamation. The case was later settled, but in an August 2020 court filing, a content creator named Raegan Fingles signed a declaration accusing Smith of giving him alcohol and aggressively kissing him while livestreaming when he was 17. An attached exhibit contained a screenshot of the moment on the livestream. Fingles told the Los Angeles Times that the FBI interviewed him about the incident in June. In response to the Times, Smith acknowledged the kiss happened, but said the incident had been “greatly blown out of proportion.” The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment. As the dispute between Smith and the parents of former “Squad” members winds up in court, the genre of YouTube content involving child influencers has only grown in popularity. Catalina Goanta, an associate professor in law and technology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, has researched child influencers around the world and said the industry has boomed as more forms of monetization become available, like advertising revenue, merchandising, live events and sponsorships. Still, there are few forms of protection for the child stars of YouTube. “You can have the production of Disney channel, starring your child, in your home,” Goanta said. “We have rules for child labor, especially entertainment labor. Now we need to expand that to be applicable to the activities of children in the intimacy of their home.” Attorneys for the plaintiffs said that, first and foremost, they hope to get their clients compensated for their work and for the turmoil they say the teens experienced after joining the “Squad.” But as to whether this case will cause a ripple effect in the child influencer industry leading to more significant change? They’re unsure. One outcome that some advocates would like to see is for California to re-examine legislation that pertains to child performers, such as the Coogan Law, which affirms that earnings by minors in the entertainment industry are the property of the minor, not their parents, according to the industry union SAG-AFTRA. The law also requires parents to put 15 percent of a child’s earnings into a blocked trust account, often called a Coogan Account. If the law were to be re-examined, experts and plaintiffs hope it would be adjusted to include children who make content on social media regardless of whether they’re under contract or belong to a guild like SAG. The issue, Sarelson said, is that a Coogan Account wouldn’t apply to his clients because his clients weren’t paid for their time in the “Piper Squad.” “It’s a highly unregulated, Wild West environment. There’s potential for misconduct and abuse throughout the industry,” Sarelson said. “You would hope the California Legislature would investigate and take some action to make some changes, some modifications to the law.” In the meantime, the plaintiffs hope that Smith  faces consequences for her actions. Jennifer Bryant, mother of one of the plaintiffs, put it plainly: “My goal is that Tiffany Smith never works with a child again.” "
Alec Baldwin wants 'misguided' lawsuit filed by Halyna Hutchins' parents and sister dismissed,Minyvonne Burke,"April 15, 2023, 6:42 PM UTC / Updated April 15, 2023, 9:50 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Alec Baldwin is asking a judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the parents and sister of ""Rust"" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, saying that they were distant from Hutchins before her death and have ""no viable cause of action."" The actor said in court documents filed Thursday that Olga Solovey, Anatolii Androsovych, and Svetlana Zemko filed the suit to ""obtain compensation"" from Hutchins' October 2021 death on a movie set just outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico. ""The loss of a daughter and sister is undoubtedly painful in any circumstance. Yet Plaintiffs—who had been distanced from Halyna physically, financially, and emotionally for years before her death—have no viable cause of action against Defendants,"" the documents state. ""This action is especially misguided."" Hutchins’ parents and sister filed their suit in February. It names Baldwin, ""Rust"" armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, assistant director David Halls, and Rust Movie Productions, LLC. as defendants. Attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing Hutchins' family in the suit, said in a statement Saturday that Baldwin is ""once again attempting to avoid responsibility."" ""It is abundantly clear under New Mexico law , which will be applied in the California court that he is responsible for all of the harm he did to the entirety of Halyna Hutchins’ family,"" Allred said. ""We are here to make sure that he is held accountable for his actions."" Hutchins, 42, was shot and killed on Oct. 21, 2021, during filming at the Bonanza Creek Ranch. Baldwin was rehearsing with a pistol for a scene when the gun went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed were charged with involuntary manslaughter, First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announced. Halls was charged with negligent use of a deadly weapon and agreed to plead no contest, Carmack-Altwies said. Baldwin has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Last year, the actor was sued by Hutchins’ husband, Matthew Hutchins, their son and estate, alleging that reckless behavior and cost-cutting led to Hutchin's death. Baldwin and Matthew Hutchins reached a settlement in October 2022. Baldwin said in his court filing Thursday he believed the settlement ""should have been the end of the matter."" ""But it is not,"" the document states referencing the new lawsuit. ""The Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint with prejudice."" The next hearing in the case is scheduled for June 9. "
"Latina radio network owners fend off conservative critics, tout cultural focus",Suzanne Gamboa,"April 15, 2023, 10:45 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"Growing up in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Stephanie Valencia would tune in with her family on weekend mornings to a public radio station playing Mexican music and call in song dedications to relatives. That sort of local, cultural appeal is what Valencia, 40, and her business partner, Jess Morales Rocketto, 36, say they want to cultivate and maximize at the 18 mostly Spanish language radio stations they bought last year from TelevisaUnivision. Quietly and with little notice, the two Latinas and their newly found Latino Media Network (LMN) began operations March 30 at three radio stations in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, a region of highly-coveted Latino votes that has drawn renewed attention in recent election cycles. There was far more fanfare and blowback last summer, when the Latinas’ $60 million purchase of the 18 stations, including these three valley stations, became public. That news triggered an outcry from Republicans, who asserted the buy would silence conservative voices, even though conservative media owners have been expanding into Spanish-language media as well. Valencia and Morales Rocketto, who worked for former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton respectively, have downplayed their partisan backgrounds and fended off conservatives' criticism that  they secured financing from an investment firm associated with the foundation of liberal philanthropist George Soros. Repeatedly, they have said they do not plan to use the stations to push the Democratic Party’s message. In a recent interview with NBC News, the two women said their vision is to harness Latino cultural touchstones in music, sports and entertainment to build trusted news and consumer information sources. Lost in last summer’s commotion has been the fact that the two Latinas, neither hugely wealthy, have barged into the ranks of majority media ownership. Few other Latinos are found there — Latinos were majority owners in only 9% of FM and 3% of AM noncommercial radio stations and in 5% of FM and 3% of AM commercial stations in 2021, according to the latest Federal Communications Commission broadcast ownership report. That’s even though Hispanics are avid radio listeners. Maria Contreras-Sweet, one of several Latino minority partners or advisers in the purchase, said that while Latinas have made political strides, they need to accelerate their economic parity. “This is that kind of effort, where two young women have understood how to gain access to capital to buy a business — it’s a triple bank shot,” Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under Obama and founded a commercial bank aimed at Latinos, said, borrowing a billiards term to describe the LMN purchase. Radio reaches 97% of the Latino population monthly, more than live or recorded television, smartphone content, TV-connected devices, computers or tablets, according to a 2022 Nielsen report. For this growing segment of Americans, radio is a prime source of information. Its popularity has also put a focus on stations’ content and elevated criticism of conservative voices propagating the spread of misinformation. The stations Valencia and Morales Rocketto purchased are in eight of the top 10 markets, which the Latinas said reach 33% of U.S. Latinos. “Radio is such a constant for this community that if you’re looking to make a bet, radio and Latinos is a pretty good one,” said Stacie de Armas, senior vice president of diverse insights and intelligence at Nielsen. “We own the properties that are serving our community, which is a huge reason why we took this leap,” Valencia said, “and took the chance when we knew Univision was selling these stations and that they could potentially end up in non-Latino hands.” LMN's acquisition of Miami's Radio Mambí, a fixture in the Cuban American community, drew the most outrage when the purchase was made known. The conservative station is hugely popular in Miami, but it and others have drawn criticism over some hosts’ comments that include the spread of false information, such as that the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol was started by antifa or claims that Joe Biden's 2020 presidential victory was due to fraudulent elections. Americano Media, which bills itself as the Spanish-language Fox News, switched last year from broadcasting its programming on satellite radio to providing content on a Miami station that replaced its sports programming with the conservative talk format. The partnership with Audacy, a free broadcast and internet platform that owns the station, includes some Radio Mambí alums who left when LMN bought it. Since the stations’ purchase, Valencia and Morales Rocketto have pushed back when asked if their programming will serve as a counterweight to right-wing commentary and targeted misinformation. According to Morales Rocketto, because of their previous work in administrations, she and Valencia understand the limits of political discourse and messaging. “We really believe in the power of not only the legislative process or only the government to make change; we really see how the media and culture and entertainment influence how you think and feel,” she said. The two women said they’d like to provide more programming and content on financial literacy, particularly with so many Latinos starting small businesses, as well as on health and parenthood. Nonetheless, in today’s political climate, their ownership of stations in eight of the top 10 Hispanic media markets can’t be overlooked, said Stella Rouse, a politics and government professor at the University of Maryland. Even if they aren’t seeking to turn the stations into a left-wing Fox News, LMN will provide a needed counterbalance, she said. “If there’s an opportunity, even if it’s indirect, that’s a step forward  because that’s — radio stations that are not going to be perhaps taken over by others who might have this right-wing misinformation agenda.” Al Cárdenas, an attorney who chaired the Florida Republican Party and was an adviser to former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, said he wants Hispanic radio to return to more content creation, which is why he helped buy the stations. Cárdenas, who split from Republican backers of former President Donald Trump, said he sees the LMN purchase as an attempt to create stations and content that “emphasizes knowledge rather than fiction.” “There might be at the outset other investments that will have a higher yield — but this goes to the heart and soul of who I am as a Hispanic,” said Cárdenas, who added that he listens to Spanish-language, Hispanic radio while driving. Valencia and Morales Rocketto said they got the idea to get into the radio market through their work at Equis Research, a Democratic, Latino-focused research and survey firm. Some of their most recent research has focused on who can best persuade uncertain Latinos that disinformation or misinformation is false. Their work meant spending a lot of time talking to Latinos, learning their main information sources. “The more and more we looked at the data, radio was like a glaring alarm bell, that’s what people were listening to,” Morales Rocketto said. “It was like smacking us over the head with a radio.” From the moment they first learned that TelevisaUnivision was selling the radio stations to the time the deal was announced, it was about 85 days, Valencia said. Valencia had first intended to buy one station and sought the help of Tom Castro, a Houston capital investor who had once owned as many as 53 different radio stations. “She had the idea she wanted me to help her understand where the news deserts were in the Latino community, because she wanted to see if she could address those, to increase the civic awareness of the Latino community and ultimately the civic participation,” Castro said. “I had always wanted to use radio for this purpose, but you know,  building a company with lenders and investors, they never allowed us in my companies to do as much of this — so I thought I had an obligation to help,” he said. Valencia and Morales Rocketto said they had to rally their network’s collective influence — they described as a “Latino barn-raising” — since Univision was already on the “2-yard line” in finding buyers. “Univision was like, ‘Who are these ladies? They’ve never really done anything in the radio business, they are not media types,” Morales Rocketto said. “We really had to rely on our community to make calls for us, to say, ‘Take them seriously,’ ... and to Univision’s credit, they realized that we were serious and took our call.” Tom Chavez, an entrepreneur who invests in technology and digital companies and who helped with the radio station’s purchase, said his backing makes sense because he believes in Valencia and Morales Rocketto’s mission — as well as the potential of Latino entrepreneurship. “One of the tricky things in our community is a certain kind of reticence when it comes to matters of wealth,” he said. “Latinos have to honor values of putting family first, but also recognize that wealth matters, right?” Chavez said being a minority partner brings all of that together, while the purchase helps maintain different Latino regions’ specific cultures — from the Texas-Mexican culture in the Rio Grande Valley to the Cuban culture in Miami. Valencia and Morales Rocketto say the radio stations are just the beginning. “Radio is the initial platform for which we launched Latino Media Network,” Valencia said. “But the true vision is ultimately building a multiplatform audio company,” not just to distribute through their own assets, but also to others, in particular Spanish-language broadcasters. The radio stations they now own in the Rio Grande Valley are an AM sports station, an FM station that plays “Spanish oldies” and another FM station that plays regional Mexican music. Valencia said their objective is to ensure there are more sources of entertainment and information out there, so “Latinos can make up their own minds.” "

Michelle Yeoh brings Oscar 'home' to her mom and to her late dad's grave,"Chrissy Callahan, TODAY","April 14, 2023, 8:12 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Michelle Yeoh has followed through on her promise to bring her new Oscar home to her mom in Malaysia. Last month, the 60-year-old became the first Asian woman to win the Academy Award for best actress. During her acceptance speech, Yeoh dedicated the award to her 84-year-old mother and other moms around the world, calling them all “superheroes.” The “Everything Everywhere All At Once” star vowed to bring the Oscar home to her mother, who lives in Malaysia, and she just shared two photos from her recent trip. In the first, her mom, Janet Yeoh, proudly holds up the Oscar as she grins from ear to ear. Michelle Yeoh also made a special trip to her late father’s grave with her Oscar in tow. The second photo captures the sweet visit and shows Yeoh clutching the award as she stands close to her father’s headstone and a plethora of beautiful flowers. The actor gave her parents a loving shoutout in the caption, which reads, “Brought Mr.O home…. Without my parents love and trust and support… I wouldn’t be here today… love so much ❤️💖✨❤️✨.” Yeoh’s fans were touched by the post and sent the actor lots of love in the comments section. “Wow nice your father will be proud of you also,” one person wrote. “Welcome home @michelleyeoh_official.

Videos of high school life in decades past stir nostalgia and debate,Uwa Ede-Osifo,"April 13, 2023, 3:37 PM UTC",Culture & Trends,"A grainy video that recently circulated on social media captured a mundane portrait of school life at the turn of the new millennium. Students smile and wave toward the camera as they pass through a hallway of blue metal lockers and click away at clunky, outdated desktop computers. “High school in 2002 looked so chill,” said a caption on a post of the video that has accrued more than 66 million views on Twitter. It's the kind of video that has become something of a viral phenomenon in recent years, offering a combination of nostalgia and social commentary on how times have changed. The videos are usually a montage of happy moments or interviews with students about where they hope to be in the future. Various such videos have surfaced on the internet including Reddit threads and Twitter. On YouTube, a quick search turns up any number of videos, some of which have millions of views. Entire accounts on TikTok are dedicated to posting the archival footage. The videos often inspire a range of comments about the way things were, which in turn has generated debate about just what exactly it is that people are nostalgic about. This most recent video is no exception after one user retweeted the post and said, “It really feels like Millenials were the last people who got a largely apolitical high school experience."" That drew a variety of responses, including disagreement over the idyllic portrayal of the past. “ah yes. The blissful apolitical experience of 9/11 and the aftermath,” one user wrote in response. “'High school in 2002 looked so chill' if you were white and straight,'” another replied. A near-constant refrain on such videos centers on technology — most notably the lack of it. “Technology and social media ruined it :( ,” one user wrote on another TikTok video labeled ""High school in 2001.” “When people interacted with each other,” another commented on the same video. Clay Routledge, a psychologist who has studied nostalgia, said that people are sentimental toward the past because retrospection provides a degree of comfort. “The past has already unfolded. So there’s something stabilizing about looking backwards,” he added. Amid recent studies that linked social media use to mental health disorders and revealed teenage girls are facing unprecedented levels of depression and anxiety, nostalgia may be a form of “creative problem solving,” Routledge said. Of course, the past is not limited to the era before social media — meaning that internet nostalgia also exists. Gen Zers speak fondly of memes and jokes that circulated on the video-sharing app Vine, while millennials muse on what their old profiles on Myspace used to look like. Social media companies have also recognized the power of a walk down memory lane and court consumers with features that resurface old content (posts, photographs, and videos). When the world feels uncertain, people search for elements of the past to extract guidance and confidence for the future, Routledge said. Whether high school in 2002 was “chill” remains a contentious point online. Twitter users found common ground elsewhere; many acknowledged the distinct experience of maturing in an online world versus a time predating common social media use. “Being in high school is (at least partially) tough no matter where or when you grew up but in hindsight, I’m grateful that I graduated before Facebook or MySpace were a thing,” one user said. “But I also see how having social media and blogging sites could have made me and lots of other kids feel less alone (esp in our identities), and it’s so interesting to hear how younger generations benefitted from those connections!” the user continued. Another user appeared unfazed by the online discourse, instead tweeting about its familiarity: “People moaned then too about the good old days.” "
Latinos who are religiously unaffiliated continue to grow,Suzanne Gamboa,"April 13, 2023, 2:00 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Engel Martinez, 27, grew up Catholic, attending Sunday catechism classes and celebrating his First Communion and confirmation; his grandmother had even urged him to become a priest. Martinez, of San Diego, now considers himself religiously unaffiliated. The share of Latinos who, like Martinez, say they are religiously unaffiliated grew last year, while the share of those who are Catholic continued to slide, a Pew Research survey released Thursday finds. In 2022, 30% of Latinos considered themselves religiously unaffiliated — on par with overall U.S. adults and up from a quarter of Latinos the previous year. ""The demographic forces shaping the nation’s Latino population also have impacted religious affiliation trends,"" Pew senior writer Jens Manuel Krogstad wrote in the report. ""Young people born in the U.S. — not immigrants — have driven Latino population growth since the 2000s."" Among U.S. Latinos ages 18 to 29, about half (49%) now identify as religiously unaffiliated. By contrast, only about 1-in-5 Latinos ages 50 and older are unaffiliated. While 43% of Latinos still identify as Catholic, that’s down 3 percentage points from 2021. The share of Latinos who are evangelical Protestants — 15%, a small bump up from 2021 — lagged behind those who are unaffiliated or Catholic. Latinos who identify as not affiliated with a religion have steadily increased since 2016. The share of evangelical Protestants has remained generally steady, according to the Pew study of 7,647 adults, including 3,029 Hispanics, which was conducted Aug. 1-14. As of last year, one-third of Latinos said their current religions are different from the ones they were raised in. Martinez said he’s not atheist. He still prays and believes some of the theology he learned. But he said he began to drift from Catholicism after he attended a youth retreat when he was an eighth grader. Catholic instructors and leaders there shared the anti-contraceptive, anti-abortion teachings of the church and other stances, which Martinez said didn’t sit right with him, because “the ethics of it didn’t seem to connect.” Shedding his Catholic upbringing wasn’t easy, Martinez said, because his family members are devout Catholics. His mother had been a nun, and his parents attend Mass during the week and on Sundays. When he told his parents he no longer accepted Catholic teachings, “they were not OK with it,"" he said. ""I would go [to Mass] sometimes to keep the family calm, but I gradually stopped going."" Sixty-five percent of Latinos surveyed said they were raised Catholic, and nearly 1 in 4 of all U.S. Latinos are former Catholics, Pew reported. For every 23 Latinos who leave the church, there is one Latino who has become Catholic, according to the report. "
Ariana Grande speaks out about ‘concerns’ surrounding her weight,"Ariana Brockington, TODAY","April 13, 2023, 1:17 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Ariana Grande is addressing recent speculation about her health in a rare message to her fans. On Tuesday, the 29-year-old singer and actor uploaded a video to TikTok where she sincerely opened up about current comments involving her body and past health struggles. Grande began the video by sharing that she doesn’t usually speak about rumors. However, she decided to make an exception. “I just wanted to address your concerns about my body and talk a little bit about what it means to a person with a body and to be seen … to be paid this close attention to,” she explained. She continued, “I think we should be gentler and less comfortable commenting on people’s bodies, no matter what.” Although she said she recognizes that some social media users might have good intentions and think they are being complimentary, she said it is best to just avoid discussing someone’s body. “There are ways to compliment someone or to ignore something that you see that you don’t like that I think we should help each other work towards,” she recommended. The singer’s comments come after fans began commenting on her Instagram posts about her thinness. In her video response, the “Thank U, Next” singer then pointed out that there is not one ideal image of beauty and health. “I know, personally for me, the body that you’ve been comparing my current body to was the unhealthiest version of my body,” she shared. “I was on a lot of antidepressants and drinking on them and eating poorly and at the lowest point of my life when I looked the way you consider my healthy. But that, in fact, wasn’t my healthy.” Even though she says she knows she should not feel compelled to be vulnerable and reveal her private struggles to the world, Grande said she wanted to discuss her health problems because maybe “good might come from it.” She also wanted to relay the message that everyone is going through something. “So even if you are coming from a loving place or a caring place, that person probably is working on it or has a support system that they are working on it with. You never know,” she explained. Grande added, ""So be gentle with each other and with yourselves."" She ended the three-minute clip by expressing her love for her fans and reminding them that they are always beautiful. “I think you’re beautiful no matter what you’re going through, no matter what weight, no matter how you like to do your makeup these days, no matter what cosmetic procedures you’ve had or not,” she concluded. Below the TikTok video, fans applauded and reiterated Grande’s sentiment. “Ur so sweet,” one person said. “Im so sorry this has been a constant issue.” Another commented, “It never had to reach this point for there to be a need for her to address the way she looked. ariana we love u & ur beautiful, u deserve the world.” The video marked a rare, candid social media appearance for the actor who has been busy filming the upcoming movie adaptation of “Wicked,” which will be a two-part film. Grande has been cast as Glinda. Earlier this year, she uploaded a video of her crooning along to “Over the Rainbow” from “The Wizard of Oz,” making fans eagerly anticipate her portrayal of the bubbly character. The first part of “Wicked” is set to be released in 2024. "
"'Leguizamo Does America' takes viewers on a road trip, Latino style",Raul A. Reyes,"April 13, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"John Leguizamo offers up a simple inspiration for his latest series. “I wanted to do a show where people watch this and say, ‘I wanna be Latino!’ or ‘Damn, too bad I’m not Latino!’” Leguizamo, the acclaimed actor, comedian, producer and activist, takes viewers on a journey as the host of “Leguizamo Does America,” a six-part docuseries premiering Sunday on MSNBC and streaming on Peacock. Produced by NBC News Studios, each episode focuses on a different city — Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C. — and its unique Latino heritage, as Leguizamo explores its culture, people and monuments and its food and restaurants. One episode focuses on Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. Leguizamo takes viewers from sound stages in Hollywood to a salsa festival in New York’s Spanish Harlem and a sacred Indigenous ceremony in Puerto Rico — all while exploring Latino contributions to American life. “Latinx history is American history,” Leguizamo says in one of the episodes, noting that Latinos have played critical roles, from the Revolutionary War to the birth of hip-hop. “Leguizamo Does America” can be viewed as part of the emerging trend of celebrity travel shows, such as “Eva Longoria: Searching for Mexico” (CNN) and “Down to Earth with Zac Efron” (Netflix). Leguizamo’s show covers a lot of ground, from the origins of New York’s famous bodegas, or corner shops, to the resident Latina conductor at the Los Angeles Opera. It features appearances by well-known actors like George Lopez, Gina Torres, Diane Guerrero and Michael Peña — who takes Leguizamo to his family's famed domino-playing gatherings in Chicago — as well as notable figures like Broadway director/choreographer Sergio Trujillo, Voto Latino’s María Teresa Kumar and fashion designer Raul Lopez. But “Leguizamo Does America” doesn’t shy from addressing issues roiling the Latino community. In New York, Leguizamo hosts a dinner party, and, alongside comedian and actor Aida Rodriguez and others, he brings up the controversy over the word “Latinx,” a gender-neutral alternative to Latino or Latina — and why it's so polarizing to some. In Los Angeles, Leguizamo talks about the challenge of creating Latino-themed stories with television producer Gloria Calderón Kellett. Because of Latinos' diversity and complexity, “we’re a hard audience, because there’s been such a starvation for representation that when one thing exists — it better represent all of us,” she says. In Miami, actor and playwright Carmen Pelaez explains how immigration continues to transform the politics of her hometown. “Miami is the shore where the people of every failed government of Latin America land. ... You know what government is currently failing in Latin America from the accent you hear on the street in Miami.” From his early days as a solo theater artist in New York City to his well-known roles in films and television, Leguizamo, 62, has enjoyed a long and multifaceted career. He received a special Tony Award in 2018 for his Broadway show “Latin History for Morons” and earned Critic’s Choice and Emmy nominations for his role as Raymond Santana Sr. in the Netflix series “When They See Us.” In recent years, he has become an advocate for the Latino community, lending his voice to the struggle for more Latino representation in the entertainment industry. Part of his reason for doing the show was that “it takes a long time for Latin kids to understand that they have something to be proud of, that everything they are is something beautiful and powerful.” Leguizamo said most people — including many Latinos — don’t know that the first non-Indigenous resident of Manhattan was Dominican (Juan Rodriguez) or that one of television’s early moguls was Latino (Desi Arnaz). “This country was not made without us,” he said. “It was made because of us.” Ben DeJesus, the show’s director, said the series “was one of the life-changing experiences of my career,” adding: “This is something we feel is worth celebrating: our Latino culture and the richness of our food, our music and our activism. It’s a lot of Latin themes and people, but this is really a show for all kinds of audiences.” In addition to the content, DeJesus, 46, is especially proud that the “Leguizamo” production team included many Latinos. “John actually mentioned to us that, in his 30-some years in the business, he had never seen so many Latin names on a call sheet,” DeJesus said. “It was intentional — and important to us to bring in as many Latino crew members and staff as possible and to provide opportunities for them to contribute their talents.” For executive producer Carolina Saavedra, one of the show's highlights was a visit to Washington, D.C.’s Gala Hispanic Theater. “Seeing the kids in the theater program there really touched me,” she said. “As an immigrant child, it brought back the experience of coming to this country, feeling alienated and initially being looked down upon because we don’t speak the language. Seeing that the kids at the Gala Theater have a safe space to express their pain, to express themselves, reminded me of the beauty and the value of this organization.” Saavedra described working on “Leguizamo Does America” as “the most meaningful job of my career.” “I’ve always wanted to tell stories about real people, stories that would move people and start conversation, stories about class, race and gender,” she said. “All of these things are my passion, and with this show, I was able to do that.” “I wanted to make sure that this was an entertaining show, an ingratiating show for any community that watches it, but also one that is specific to our Latino experience, which includes joy as well as hardship,” she added. Leguizamo hopes the series inspires a new generation of Latino scholars and artists. “Somewhere out there, there are more kids, kids like us,” he says on the show, “waiting to see their stories on stage, on screen, see their faces, see their lives. And they can — if we give them a chance.” The show premieres Sunday at 10p.m. E.T. on MSNBC. "
How Netflix's 'Beef' nailed the Korean American evangelical experience,Kimmy Yam,"April 12, 2023, 10:44 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Netflix’s chaotic comedy-drama “Beef” has dominated social media discussions since its release Thursday, but there’s one narrative in particular that Asian Americans can’t stop talking about. The show, which features a predominantly Asian American cast but doesn’t fixate on race, centers several storylines around a Korean American church in Orange County, California. For some viewers who've lived similar realities, it authentically captures the sense of belonging, social pressures and uncomfortable dynamics inextricably linked to the church. “I’ve never seen anybody portray it so perfectly,” said Michelle Park, a Korean American from the Philadelphia suburbs who was raised in the Korean church. The 10-episode series follows high-strung, struggling contractor Danny, played by Steven Yeun, and successful-yet-unfulfilled business owner Amy, portrayed by Ali Wong, after a spiraling encounter of road rage gone awry. The two become fixated on destroying one another; all the while, their own lives are collapsing around them. The Korean American church becomes a major plot point in the third episode when Danny turns to the institution when he narrowly decides against setting Amy’s parked car ablaze after seeing her daughter, Junie, sitting in the back seat. Minjung Noh, an assistant professor of transnational Christianity and gender studies at Drew University in New Jersey and an anthropologist who focuses on diasporic Korean churches in the U.S., noted the duality of how the church is portrayed as both sacred refuge and a means to an immoral end. “Steven Yeun, in episode three, cried at church. He’s been through so much and the church gives him relief, but he will utilize the church’s resources to his own benefit later. It’s sacred, but at the same time, he will make money off of the church. That is kind of contradicting. It’s also quite true of many Korean American churches in the U.S. and also in Korea,” Noh said. “That sacred and secular dynamic depicted at the same time, I thought that was genius.” A cleaned-up Danny sneaks into the back of the service and, surrounded by fellow second-generation Korean immigrants, bows his head and sobs as praise team leader Edwin, played by Justin Min, leads the live band through a soft, ambient rendition of “O Come to the Altar.” The pastor, portrayed by Eddie Shin, rests his arm on Danny’s shoulder, asking God to “please be with my brother.” Jane Hong, an Occidental College associate history professor, explained why the scenes might be hitting a nerve for some. “I think these scenes are triggering because so many Korean Americans — especially younger, English-speaking second-generation folks — have been hurt by the Korean immigrant church and church culture in general,” she said. “For many Korean Americans, Korean church and Korean culture could become inseparable at times. Korean immigrant churches could also be spaces of unbelonging and in some cases, religious trauma, broadly defined. Not surprisingly, scenes like these can easily trigger negative emotions associated with these past hurts.” Helen Jin Kim, assistant professor of American religious history at Emory University, added that the emotional intensity of the scene in part speaks to the weighty dynamics of the Korean American church. The institutions have traditionally served as not only theological spaces but also valuable communal networks, particularly for immigrants and the second generation navigating life in the U.S., Kim said. Behind faith, experts said, there’s an underlying cultural understanding and shared experience of being Korean in America. Kim pointed out that while there’s still a stigma against seeking mental health help in the Asian American community, oftentimes people will turn to the church instead for release — just as Danny, who’s revealed to be suicidal in the earlier episodes and has lost control of his own rage, does. And though showing raw emotion is seen as non-masculine, worship is the rare environment in which tears and vulnerability are accepted and welcomed, particularly among Asian men, said Nadia Kim, a professor of sociology and Asian and Asian American studies at Loyola Marymount University. “It’s a very familiar scene to see. Asian American men feel like they can express the sorrowful side of themselves,” Nadia Kim, who’s Korean American, said. “It does allow for more of a multiplicity of expression of emotions, beyond just anger.” But, Helen Jin Kim added, that doesn’t mean that masculinity standards aren’t upheld in other areas of the church outside of worship. She cited a scene later on when Danny joins a game of church intramural basketball and savagely feels the need to prove his dominance. “There’s Asian American masculine vulnerability, but then there’s all this hypermasculinity,” she said. “By one-upping the prayer team leader … he’s just kind of reinforcing those gender stereotypes and hypercompetition among Asian American men.” Noh also pointed to prevalent gender disparities found in churches that were represented on-screen. “I have been following Korean American dynamics in popular media, and also in [South] Korean films, but ‘Beef’ was exceptional,” she said. “There’s huge misogyny and patriarchy in the Korean church, and also the Korean community. You go to church to meet women,” and the women often aren’t in leadership, but rather supporting roles, she said. Noh said she binged the entire series in one sitting but found the church scenes jarring: With Korean churches being the subject of her research, she couldn’t help but analyze them, instead of simply enjoying the show. “I don’t go to church anymore. But I know the dynamics and I see them,” said Noh, who grew up in Korea attending Presbyterian church. She said that many of her students are pastors, many from South Korea and California. “They’re Korean or Korean Americans in my class, and I see the similar things happening, the hierarchy in the church leaders. That’s quite accurate in ‘Beef.’” Park said the series also delves into the concept of keeping up appearances at church. In another scene following Danny’s emotional breakdown during worship, Edwin asks about his well-being. Danny denies any messiness in his life, despite his emotional decline, suicidal tendencies and fixation on the road rage incident, blaming his tears on being lost in the worship. “He has this experience, this emotional release, this spiritual connection, and then right after, the couple, this apparently ‘perfect’ heterosexual family, with one kid on the way, they’re probing him like, ‘Are you actually well?’” Helen Jin Kim said. “He feels the need to justify the fact that ‘I’m OK,’ but he can’t tell them the full truth.” Park said the scene felt all too familiar, adding that the stressors of immigration, the need to achieve the American dream, and the gossip-heavy environment would lead many parents to compare lifestyles or adults to portray a certain rosy image of their own lives in places like church. “It’s ironic because a church is a place where everyone’s supposed to be building each other up, loving, welcoming,” she said. “I think what I saw in the Korean church, though, is that sometimes it wasn’t always like that. Like the trauma especially when you’re young and parents are like talking or gossiping.” "
Meet the 'RuPublicans': GOP lawmakers are reimagined as AI-generated drag queens,Jay Valle,"April 12, 2023, 6:57 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The category is: Republican drag queen realness. As the centuries-old art form of drag has taken a surprisingly central role in the modern-day American culture war, one drag-loving couple decided to take a creative approach to their activism: A parody Instagram account dedicated to artificial intelligence-generated portraits of Republican leaders in drag. “We’re huge fans of drag, and we were bearing witness to the GOP’s anti-drag rhetoric and action, and we wanted to do something about it, so we said, ‘Let’s put the GOP in drag,’” said Craig, who created the RuPublicans Instagram account with his husband, Stephen. The men asked that their last names not be published due to concerns for their personal safety and security. The name of the account, which launched March 30 and now has over 95,000 followers, is a nod to “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” the popular drag competition show. The RuPublicans account has posted portraits of 11 conservative heavy hitters so far, each given his own distinctive style and, of course, drag name. And while it might appear that these men each had their own glam team on hand, the images were purely created by Craig, Stephen and an AI text-to-image program called Midjourney. “It’s all generated without a photo that we input,” Craig said. “I provide prompts on what I want to see in the photo — what’s in the background, what is the person wearing, how are they feeling, like it gets into that level of specificity — and then it spits out images, and you don’t always get what you want, and sometimes the AI generator gives you something that you could have never even imagined that blows you away, and you like run with it.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — who made national headlines last year by signing his state’s so-called Don’t Say Gay bill and engaging in a faceoff with the CEO of the Walt Disney Co. — is among the Republicans given an AI drag makeover. His drag alter ego, “Rhonda Santy,” is shown in a trio of images, including one portraying her as an evil stepmother-type villain with Disney’s Magic Kingdom in the background. “Rhonda Santy — Category is: Book Banning Princess Eleganza. She’s on a mission to turn that Magic Kingdom into a Tragic Kingdom and isn’t afraid to give Mickey the finger(s),” the caption on the DeSantis parody images reads. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is portrayed as “Cruzella Deville” in five portraits, which all include the conservative lawmaker in a full face of makeup, a blond or pink wig and bedazzled gowns. “Cruzella Deville — Serving homophobic realness, she struts her stuff in fur coats lined with family values and defends every fetus and every gun,” the caption says of the reimagination of Cruz, who recently said the Supreme Court was “clearly wrong” in its 2015 decision to legalize same-sex marriage. Neither DeSantis nor Cruz immediately responded to requests for comment. Rudy Giuliani (“Rudy Garland”), Lindsey Graham (“Lady Graham Cracker”) and Mike Pence (“Mother Pence”) are among the other political figures who have been reimagined as drag queens by the RuPublicans account. While Craig and Stephen called their RuPublicans project “pure fantasy,” they said they hope it can also serve as a platform for activism. “We want it to serve as a platform for a message and show that drag really isn’t that scary,” Stephen said. “It makes you laugh, and it makes you think, and this isn’t just for us and gay people. I hope that a lot of Republicans see this and can have a laugh at themselves, too.” So far this year, Republican lawmakers in more than a dozen states have proposed bills to restrict drag performances, according to an NBC News analysis. Tennessee is the only state to sign such a bill into law. While the photos have sparked thousands of responses since the account first launched, one in particular made a big impact on Craig and Stephen, they said. The message was from a woman whose child attends The Covenant School, a private Christian school in Nashville, where just a few weeks ago a mass shooting left three children and three adults dead. The mother said she had her first laugh in weeks upon seeing the RuPublicans account. “She had this beautiful message about how important it is, what we’re doing, and how much it helped her,” Craig said. “So those are the types of things that are like fueling this, and keeping it going.” “You know, there’s a lot of dark times that we’re living through right now, and we just want to spread brightness and laughter and levity, but also be really smart and poignant with it,” Stephen said.

Daddy Yankee’s ‘Gasolina’ is the first reggaeton hit included in the National Recording Registry,Nicole Acevedo,"April 12, 2023, 9:00 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"Daddy Yankee’s global hit ""Gasolina"" is the first reggaeton song to be inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress. The song is among the 25 recordings and albums selected Wednesday for preservation at the nation’s audio history library. ""Gasolina"" didn’t just catapult the Puerto Rican rapper into mainstream success in 2004, it also marked the beginning of the globalization of reggaeton, a Latin urban music genre that was once considered clandestine. Puerto Rico is often regarded as the birthplace of reggaeton, but its roots go back to 1980's Panama, where Afro Panamanians began translating Jamaican dancehall songs into Spanish and making reggae en español tracks. At the same time, Puerto Rico's Spanish-language hip-hop scene was picking up steam. The first reggaeton tracks eventually emerged in the early 1990s — when the genre was known as “underground."" It later became known as reggaeton after artists started infusing the distinctive dem bow beats that currently characterize the genre. ""Gasolina"" was released as the lead single for Yankee's third studio album ""Barrio Fino."" It marked the first time a reggaeton album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. Yankee, who was born Ramón Luis Ayala Rodríguez, won a Latin Grammy in 2005 for his album “Barrio Fino, after the Latin Recording Academy renamed the best rap or hip-hop album category to best urban music album — signaling the growing popularity of the genre. ""Gasolina"" was also the first reggaeton song to be nominated for the Latin Grammy for record of the year that same year. The accomplishments signaled to the Latin music industry — which had long focused just on pop, rock en español and Mexican regional music — that reggaeton had a place in the mainstream music scene. Since then, Yankee has been revered as one of the main pioneers who popularized the once underground genre, making it one of the most recognizable and profitable sounds in the music industry. Following his 32-year music career, Yankee concluded his farewell tour in December after announcing his retirement. ""This career has been a marathon,” Yankee, 46, told his fans during his announcement last year. “It was you who gave me the keys to open this genre and make it the biggest in the world."" In addition to “Gasolina,” other songs by Latinos inducted to the National Recording Registry include “Flashdance ... What a Feeling” by Irene Cara; “All I Want for Christmas Is You” by Mariah Carey, who is of Afro Venezuelan heritage; and “The Very First Mariachi Recordings” by Cuarteto Coculense. In 1983, Cara became the voice of a generation with “Flashdance  ... What a Feeling,” the theme song of the film ""Flashdance."" The song from the performer of Black, Cuban and Puerto Rican heritage, has endured through the decades as an empowering anthem. “Flashdance … What A Feeling” won for best original song at the 1984 Academy Awards. Cara, 63, died in November. Yankee’s and Cara’s hits were among dozens of songs from Latino artists nominated by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in November for inclusion in the registry for their “significant creative and cultural impact.” Of the 625 titles that have been included in the National Recording Registry since 2002, only 26 are from Latino artists, according to the Library of Congress. The holiday smash hit “All I Want for Christmas Is You” is Carey’s first song to make the National Recording Registry. A modest hit upon release in 1994, the song has grown over time to hit No. 1 on pop charts for the last four years. “I’m most proud of the arrangements, the background vocal arrangements,” Carey, 54, said in a statement. “‘All I Want for Christmas’ is sort of in its own little category, and I’m very thankful for it.” Some of the first mariachi music recordings from Cuarteto Coculense are being preserved in the registry alongside the modern-day big hits. The four musicians from the Mexican state of Jalisco recorded the album in Mexico City between 1908 and 1909. Scholars and sound archivists later reissued the album, “The Very First Mariachi Recordings” in 1998 to revive a chapter in mariachi history that would have otherwise been lost. “The National Recording Registry preserves our history through recorded sound and reflects our nation’s diverse culture,” Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said in a statement. ""The national library is proud to help ensure these recordings are preserved for generations to come."" Every year, the registry selects 25 recordings worthy of preservation. "
UConn's Lou Lopez Sénéchal is the first Mexican-born player to be drafted by the WNBA,Edwin Flores,"April 11, 2023, 9:34 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"UConn's Lou Lopez Sénéchal became the first player born in Mexico to be drafted by the WNBA when she was selected by the Dallas Wings with the fifth overall pick on Monday. “I’ve come a long way — very grateful for my journey and all the steps I’ve achieved. [I’m] very grateful to be here,” Lopez Sénéchal, a 6-foot-1 forward, told ESPN reporter Holly Rowe minutes after being drafted. Her milestone comes a year after Evina Westbrook became the first Mexican American to be drafted by the Minnesota Lynx; she now plays for the Washington Mystics. A few hours before being drafted on Monday, Lopez Sénéchal wrote on Twitter how grateful she was to attend the draft. Her path to the WNBA and collegiate basketball was unconventional and arduous. Lopez Sénéchal was born in Guadalajara in the Mexican state of Jalisco; her father is Mexican and her mom is French. After her parents separated when she was 5, she stayed to live with her mom in Grenoble, France. At 19, she was attending a basketball academy in Ireland. Playing basketball in America after high school wasn't a consideration at first, ESPN reported. With the help of her stepfather, she applied to 280 Division I and II colleges and universities in the U.S. She eventually accepted an offer at Fairfield University in Connecticut, where she would help lead the team to a conference title in 2022 — the school's first in 24 years. She would also be selected as the 2022 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Player of the Year and be included in four all-conference teams. After transferring to UConn last fall, Lopez Sénéchal would be one of the breakout stars of the 2022-23 season, averaging 15.5 points per game and hitting 44% of her 3-point attempts. Her final game in college ended in a loss to Ohio State, 73-61, putting an end to UConn's historic run in the NCAA women's tournament. The Huskies had reached the round of 8 every year since 2005 and the Final Four since 2007, winning six national championships, including four straight from 2013 to 2016. Lopez Sénéchal finished her last game with a team high of 25 points, despite limping off in the second quarter with a knee injury and later returning in the second half. She finished her five-year collegiate career with 2,173 points and 585 rebounds, earning a bachelor's degree in marketing from Fairfield, and will soon receive another bachelor's from UConn in general studies. “I think this year, you know, I had the confidence and the trust from everyone around me, my coaches, my teammates and it gave me confidence to realize I can compete at this level, too,"" Lopez Sénéchal said.

Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy set to be the 1st woman and person of color to direct a 'Star Wars' film,Brahmjot Kaur,"April 11, 2023, 6:07 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, an Academy Award-winning and International Emmy Award-winning director and journalist, will be the first person of color and the first woman to direct a “Star Wars” film. She will direct one of the three upcoming films announced Friday at Lucasfilm’s Star Wars Celebration Europe 2023. The film, which will be set after 2019’s “Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker,” will focus on Jedi Master Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she builds a new Jedi order. Obaid-Chinoy, who is Pakistani Canadian, shared her excitement about the role on Instagram. “I’ve spent my life meeting real life heroes, who have overcome the most oppressive empires and battled impossible odds and that to me is the heart of Star Wars...which is why I was attracted to the promise of a new Jedi Order …And why I’m particularly excited about being immersed inside a Jedi Academy with a powerful Jedi Master,” she wrote. It was also announced that directors James Mangold (“Indiana Jones”) and Dave Filoni (“The Mandalorian”) were tapped to direct the other upcoming films in the franchise. “We’re thrilled to be working with some of the best and most passionate filmmakers on projects that will span the past, the present and the future,” Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said during the showcase about the production company’s projects. Past directors for the franchise’s films include George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, Richard Marquand, J.J. Abrams, Gareth Edwards, Rian Johnson and Ron Howard.

Brittney Griner working on memoir about Russian captivity,The Associated Press,"April 11, 2023, 4:57 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Saying she is ready to share the “unfathomable” experience of being arrested and incarcerated in Russia, basketball star Brittney Griner is working on a memoir that is scheduled for spring 2024. Griner was arrested last year at the airport in Moscow on drug-related charges and detained for nearly 10 months, much of that time in prison. Her plight unfolded at the same time Russia invaded Ukraine and further heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S., ending only after she was freed in exchange for the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. A WNBA All-Star with the Phoenix Mercury, Griner had flown to Moscow in February 2022 to rejoin UMMC Ekaterinburg, a Russian women’s team she has played for in the off-season since 2014. “That day (in February) was the beginning of an unfathomable period in my life which only now am I ready to share,” Griner said in a statement released Tuesday by Alfred A. Knopf. “The primary reason I traveled back to Russia for work that day was because I wanted to make my wife, family, and teammates proud. After an incredibly challenging 10 months in detainment, I am grateful to have been rescued and to be home. Readers will hear my story and understand why I’m so thankful for the outpouring of support from people across the world.” Griner added that she also hoped her book would raise awareness of other Americans detained overseas, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrested in Russia last month and accused of espionage; businessman Kai Li, serving a 10-year sentence in China on charges of revealing state secrets to the FBI; and Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive imprisoned in Russia on spying charges. Around the time Griner was released, Whelan criticized the U.S. government for not doing enough to help him. Russia has been a popular playing destination for top WNBA athletes in the offseason, with some earning salaries over $1 million — nearly quadruple what they can make as a base WNBA salary. Despite pleading guilty to possessing canisters with cannabis oil, a result of what she said was hasty packing, Griner still faced trial under Russian law. Griner’s memoir is currently untitled and will eventually be published in a young adult edition. Financial terms were not disclosed. In Tuesday’s press statement, Knopf said that the book would be “intimate and moving” and that Griner would disclose “in vivid detail her harrowing experience of her wrongful detainment (as classified by the State Department) and the difficulty of navigating the byzantine Russian legal system in a language she did not speak.” “Griner also describes her stark and surreal time living in a foreign prison and the terrifying aspects of day-to-day life in a women’s penal colony,” the announcement reads. “At the heart of the book, Griner highlights the personal turmoil she experienced during the near ten-month ordeal and the resilience that carried her through to the day of her return to the United States last December.” Griner, 32, is a 6-foot-9 two-time Olympic gold medalist, three-time All-American at Baylor University, a prominent advocate for pay equity for women athletes and the first openly gay athlete to reach an endorsement deal with Nike. She is the author of one previous book, “In My Skin: My Life On and Off the Basketball Court,” published in 2014. In February, she re-signed with the Mercury and will play in its upcoming season, which runs from May through September. "

YouTubers square off in the boxing ring for Creator Clash 2,Daysia Tolentino,"April 11, 2023, 12:58 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Harley Morenstein is an eater, not a fighter. The co-creator of the YouTube food channel Epic Meal Time, he’s known for cooking bacon-wrapped meals and other ostentatious eats. But this Saturday, he’ll step into a boxing ring to square off against professional wrestler John Hennigan, one of 12 bouts that will make up Creator Clash 2. Last year’s event — something of a surprise success — sold out the 10,000-seat Yuengling Center in Tampa, Florida, drew more than 100,000 pay-per-view buyers and raised $1.3 million for the Alzheimer’s Association, American Heart Association and Healing Horse Therapy Center. The YouTube video of the full event has accrued more than 3.3 million views. The event brings unlikely internet celebrities together to do something unexpected. It’s like a concert crossed with “Dancing With the Stars,” if the stars were all punching each other in the face. “When I was there, I thought the vibe was way more similar to a VidCon or a fan meetup,” Morenstein said of the event’s first year (VidCon is the year’s biggest in-person event for internet content creators). “People came with their merchandise already. They are fans of certain fighters. They wanted to watch one person on the card. They didn’t care who they were fighting.” It’ll be Morenstein’s second bout. Last year, he emerged victorious against his friend Arin Hanson of the gaming YouTube channel Game Grumps in a match that surprised even him. “I had his little blood stain on my glove,” Morenstein said. “And he was fine, but I was still like, ‘Oh, my god, he was supposed to go to Busch Gardens today. He’s got a bloody nose and like, what am I doing here?’” Live events have been a staple of internet creator culture dating back to early fan meetups. Conventions like VidCon and Playlist Live have given fans the opportunity to interact with their favorite content creators for over a decade. But in recent years, influencers have begun to create their own live events tailored to their communities, including tours, award shows and even their own conventions, to varying degrees of success. Meanwhile, boxing emerged more recently as a popular way for internet creators to settle beefs, attract attention and fire up their most fervent fans. Beginning with the fight between YouTubers Olajide Olatunji (better known as KSI) and Joe Weller in 2018, established creators have increasingly pivoted to boxing after finding the sport to be a lucrative opportunity. Much of the hype around influencer matches, like most boxing events, is predicated on showboating, betting and trash talking. Creator Clash hardly has any of that. Instead, it aims to be different by de-emphasizing online drama and big payouts, said Ian Jomha, one of the event’s co-founders, who will also jump in the ring on Saturday. Jomha said that the sport of boxing itself has enough drama to focus on and that the main goals of Creator Clash are to “entertain and raise money for charity.” This year, the event is bigger, with three additional fights, more commentators, 15 charity partners and a venue that’s double the size (Tampa's Amalie Arena). “I think the wider the variety of creators that you get, the more interesting it’s going to be and the more curiosity you’re going to have,” Jomha, who is known for his audacious YouTube reaction channel iDubbbz, said. “For me, that’s always been the appeal.” The event also capitalizes on the pivot toward niche communities in the creator space. In recent years, it has become increasingly important for creators’ longevity to cultivate a core fanbase rather than appeal to a general audience. Niches produce stronger, more engaged fans that will, for instance, follow a person into a boxing arena and show their support. In addition to the charity aspect, several fighters told NBC News that the event allowed them to try something new, meet other influencers and get out of their comfort zones. Influencers and fans have praised Creator Clash for the positive energy, collaboration and good sportsmanship around the event. Amanda Golka, a YouTuber who reviews influencer events for her channel Swell Entertainment, attended last year’s Creator Clash as a spectator. Golka was pleasantly surprised, but said that this year is a “really big test” for Creator Clash’s longevity. “The novelty as a whole for YouTube events and creator events, doing sports and things like that, the sentiment I’m seeing online from the general public of people who just watch YouTube, whether they’re fans of these people or not, a lot of people are getting sick of these events,” she said. “They’re like, ‘Why can’t you just make content? What do you mean you guys are getting into boxing? Like what are you doing?’” Jomha knows the pressure is on. “It feels like it’s the first time we’re doing it, just having to do it again,” he said. “Because you got to at least match what you did last time, but you also have to do more.” With higher expectations and more eyes on the event, it is perhaps unsurprising that the organizers have run into some drama in the weeks before fight time. Less than a month before the event, it was announced that YouTube rapper Tyler Cassidy, or Froggy Fresh, had been dropped from the lineup and would be replaced. The backlash that ensued took over the conversation around Creator Clash and threatened its success, as some Cassidy fans vowed to boycott the event and demanded refunds. However, Jomha felt the event would thrive in spite of the outrage. “Our whole objective is to keep it obviously drama free and positive, and that’s the goal,” Jomha said. “And we got to focus on, you know, our fights, because we’ve all been working hard.” "
"Family, fans mourn death of Mexican ballad singer Julián Figueroa, 27, of heart ailment",Edwin Flores,"April 11, 2023, 8:08 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"The death of Mexican ballad singer Julián Figueroa from a heart ailment at 27 has left his family and fans reeling. Figueroa, whose hits included “Yo sería,” “Ay amor” and “Volaré,” was known for his ballads sung with a traditional band, similar to his late father, the acclaimed singer Joan Sebastian, who died in 2015. “I gave her the news — and truthfully she’s not well, she’s very bad, she’s destroyed,” said Marco Chacón, the husband of Figueroa’s mother, the well-known actor Maribel Guardia. Chacón raised Figueroa since he was a young boy. Guardia wrote on Instagram that her son died over the weekend “of an acute heart attack.” “They found him unconscious in his room last night,” she wrote Monday. “When the ambulance arrived and the police found him dead, there was no sign of violence.” “I wish I could talk to everyone who’s trying to communicate with me,” she wrote in Spanish, “but in truth I’m not strong enough to do that yet.” Dr. Omar Mejía Rivera, a cardiologist, told Noticias Telemundo that “sadly, we’ve seen that the degenerative illness because of blocked arteries” is now more prevalent in young patients. The Mexican singer Lucero said on Twitter: ""The sad news of the passing of Julián Figueroa seems impossible to believe. Rest in peace, Mexico is in mourning."" The Puerto Rican singer Olga Tañón tweeted that she was praying that God ""embraces our adored friend"" Maribel Guardia ""in this moment when she most needs you!"" Figueroa died in El Pedregal, where he lived most of his life. He is survived by his wife, the singer and actor Imelda Tuñón, and their son. Funeral plans were not immediately announced. "
"Al Jaffee, award-winning Mad magazine cartoonist, dies at 102",The Associated Press,"April 11, 2023, 7:44 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"Al Jaffee, Mad magazine’s award-winning cartoonist and ageless wise guy who delighted millions of kids with the sneaky fun of the Fold-In and the snark of “Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions,” has died. He was 102. Jaffee died Monday in Manhattan from multiple organ failure, according to his granddaughter, Fani Thomson. He had retired at the age of 99. Mad magazine, with its wry, sometimes pointed send-ups of politics and culture, was essential reading for teens and preteens during the baby-boom era and inspiration for countless future comedians. Few of the magazine’s self-billed “Usual Gang of Idiots” contributed as much — and as dependably — as the impish, bearded cartoonist. For decades, virtually every issue featured new material by Jaffee. His collected “Fold-Ins,” taking on everyone in his unmistakably broad visual style from the Beatles to TMZ, was enough for a four-volume box set published in 2011. Readers savored his Fold-Ins like dessert, turning to them on the inside back cover after looking through such other favorites as Antonio Prohías’ “Spy vs. Spy” and Dave Berg’s “The Lighter Side.” The premise, originally a spoof of the old Sports Illustrated and Playboy magazine foldouts, was that you started with a full-page drawing and question on top, folded two designated points toward the middle and produced a new and surprising image, along with the answer. The Fold-In was supposed to be a onetime gag, tried out in 1964 when Jaffee satirized the biggest celebrity news of the time: Elizabeth Taylor dumping her husband, Eddie Fisher, in favor of “Cleopatra” co-star Richard Burton. Jaffee first showed Taylor and Burton arm in arm on one side of the picture, and on the opposite side a young, handsome man being held back by a policeman. Fold the picture in and Taylor and the young man are kissing. The idea was so popular that Mad editor Al Feldstein wanted a follow-up. Jaffee devised a picture of 1964 GOP presidential contenders Nelson Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater that, when collapsed, became an image of Richard Nixon. “That one really set the tone for what the cleverness of the Fold-Ins has to be,” Jaffee told the Boston Phoenix in 2010. “It couldn’t just be bringing someone from the left to kiss someone on the right.” Jaffee was also known for “Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions,” which delivered exactly what the title promised. A comic from 1980 showed a man on a fishing boat with a noticeably bent reel. “Are you going to reel in the fish?” his wife asks. “No,” he says, “I’m going to jump into the water and marry the gorgeous thing.” Jaffee didn’t just satirize the culture; he helped change it. His parodies of advertisements included such future real-life products as automatic redialing for a telephone, a computer spell checker and graffiti-proof surfaces. He also anticipated peelable stamps, multiblade razors and self-extinguishing cigarettes. Jaffee’s admirers ranged from Charles M. Schulz of “Peanuts” fame and “Far Side” creator Gary Larson to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who marked Jaffee’s 85th birthday by featuring a Fold-In cake on “The Colbert Report.” When Stewart and “The Daily Show” writers put together the best-selling “America (The Book),” they asked Jaffee to contribute a Fold-In. “When I was done, I called up the producer who’d contacted me, and I said, ‘I’ve finished the Fold-In, where shall I send it?’ And he said — and this was a great compliment — ‘Oh, please Mr. Jaffee, could you deliver it in person? The whole crew wants to meet you,’” he told The Boston Phoenix. Jaffee received numerous awards, and in 2013 was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame, the ceremony taking place at San Diego Comic-Con International. In 2010, he contributed illustrations to Mary-Lou Weisman’s “Al Jaffee’s Mad Life: A Biography.” The following year, Chronicle Books published “The MAD Fold-In Collection: 1964-2010.” Art was the saving presence of his childhood, which left him with permanent distrust of adults and authority. He was born in Savannah, Georgia, but for years was torn between the U.S., where his father (a department store manager) preferred to live, and Lithuania, where his mother (a religious Jew) longed to return. In Lithuania, Jaffee endured poverty and bullying, but also developed his craft. With paper scarce and no school to attend, he learned to read and write through the comic strips mailed by his father. By his teens, he was settled in New York City and so obviously gifted that he was accepted into the High School of Music & Art. His schoolmates included Will Elder, a future Mad illustrator, and Harvey Kurtzmann, a future Mad editor. (His mother, meanwhile, remained in Lithuania and was apparently killed during the war). He had a long career before Mad. He drew for Timely Comics, which became Marvel Comics; and for several years sketched the “Tall Tales” panel for the New York Herald Tribune. Jaffee first contributed to Mad in the mid-1950s. He left when Kurtzmann quit the magazine, but came back in 1964. Mad lost much of its readership and edge after the 1970s, and Jaffee outlived virtually all of the magazine’s stars. But he rarely lacked for ideas even as his method, drawing by hand, remained mostly unchanged in the digital era. “I’m so used to being involved in drawing and knowing so many people that do it, that I don’t see the magic of it,” Jaffee told the publication Graphic NYC in 2009. “If you reflect and think about it, I’m sitting down and suddenly there’s a whole big illustration of people that appears. I’m astounded when I see magicians work; even though I know they’re all tricks. You can imagine what someone thinks when they see someone drawing freehand and it’s not a trick. It’s very impressive.” "
How 'Better Luck Tomorrow' helped change how Hollywood saw Asian Americans,Lynda Lin Grigsby,"April 10, 2023, 6:09 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Janet Wang was a junior in high school when she watched “Better Luck Tomorrow,” a movie about a group of high-achieving Asian American high schoolers with a penchant for theft and murder. In the darkened theater, she saw a reflection of herself — not in the criminal activities but in the nuanced portrayals of complex kids growing up in the suburbs. It was the first time Wang saw a cast that looked like her starring in a highly stylized movie like the MTV videos and shows she loved. Plus, it was being played in theaters. The experience changed her brain chemistry. “I think it was just very revolutionary,” Wang, 37, a podcaster on “Asian Boss Girl” said about “Better Luck Tomorrow,” the independent film that premiered in theaters 20 years ago, on April 11, 2003, distributed by MTV, which changed how Hollywood saw Asian Americans. The film’s impact can be measured by the number of millennials who credit it with inspiring and fomenting their cultural identities. “That’s irrefutable,” said Parry Shen, the actor who played clean-cut, basketball-loving Ben Manibag. Asian American actors like Manny Jacinto, who was in high school when “Better Luck Tomorrow” came out, now greet Shen in audition rooms and industry events to say the film was a turning point in their lives. “There wasn’t anything like it at the time,” Shen said. “Better Luck Tomorrow” subverted stereotypes and pushed doors open for Asian representation in lead roles as American high school teenagers who use their academic success to cloak a drug-dealing ring and a murder-for-hire gone wrong. Critics have said it made space for “Quantum Leap,” starring Raymond Lee, and “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” At the time, “Better Luck Tomorrow” was one of the few films that didn’t portray Asian Americans as either quiet and hard-working model minorities or the racialized “other” whose foreignness was the butt of the joke. (Exhibits A and B: The antipodal shadows of “The Joy Luck Club” and Long Duk Dong.) Instead, it portrayed them as nuanced and complex main characters who are straight-A students who snort cocaine, cross a prostitute’s boundary and steal computer equipment. It is a coming-of-age film that feels like the romantic comedies that defined the era — just darker, Wang said. Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist and expert on race and racism in Hollywood, said that in the early 2000s, Asian Americans weren’t seen as capable of having complexity. “Better Luck Tomorrow” was “the first of its kind in terms of just showing Asian Americans as complex anti-heroes,” Yuen said. The mindset shift led to an infamous 2002 Sundance Film Festival showdown between the film critic Roger Ebert and an audience member who questioned why filmmaker Justin Lin would choose to portray Asian American teens as strung-out, gun-toting and (gasp) test-cheating people. Ebert stood on the theater’s folding chair and defended the film. It was a permission slip for Hollywood and actors to reimagine Asian Americans in more complicated roles. Asian Americans, Ebert said, “have the right to be whoever the hell they want to be,” and “Better Luck Tomorrow” showed the world that Asian Americans could be cool. “I didn’t grow up wanting to be an actor playing good Asian boys,” said Jason Tobin, who played Virgil Hu, the unbridled teenager who totes a gun in the film. “I grew up wanting to be Robert De Niro and wanting to represent my ‘people’ by being a great actor and telling important stories.” After all, this was the ennui of Asian American youths living in the suburbs where parental and cultural expectations clashed with their lived American lives. The film is rumored to have been based on a true murder in Orange County, California. These were kids on the precipice of establishing generational wealth but who still felt anger and displacement from living in America. The complexities of those feelings are reflected on-screen in Virgil’s eyes, shining with excitement in a scene after he beats up high school jocks at a party. The thrill of the fight transmutes into fear, and he breaks down and cries. The film captured the tension and the rage of real life, Yuen said. “We all kind of want to succeed but then have the potential to be enraged and act out on that rage.” Critics have long pointed out that the film showed that Asian Americans can inhabit more than one space — that they can be ambitious, sexy and mysterious, like the motorcycle-riding Steve Choe character (a simmering matinee movie star in John Cho, who is the biggest acting star to have come out of the film). They can be nerds and murderers. “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard someone say I knew kids just like the ones in ‘BLT,’” Tobin said. When the film was released in 2003, theatergoers showed support, Shen said. That was before YouTube and social media, so efforts to coordinate support for the film on its opening weekend still came from word of mouth and grassroots organization. Shen heard stories about college Asian American organizations that rented buses to take people to the theaters. Legend has it that Quentin Tarantino yelled at theater employees to let him into a packed screening because he wanted to support the film. Shen popped into as many screenings as possible to thank moviegoers. In New York, he walked into a theater right before the film ended to take in the audience’s reactions — it laughed and gasped in shock at the right places. It was like nothing he had ever experienced before. “It was like bananas, you know?” Shen said. “Better Luck Tomorrow” changed the Hollywood landscape and Asian America’s self-perception. Shen started seeing the shift slowly after the film’s release. Back then, there were just a handful of Asian American actors in notable roles. Now, he can’t keep count. The film left the fate of the Asian American characters open-ended, and 20 years after it premiered, the actors who played Ben and Virgil are calling for some closure. “’BLT’ is a cult classic, and I think it deserves a sequel,” Tobin said. "
Santería grows in popularity in Cuba amid less stigma and economic changes,Associated Press,"April 10, 2023, 5:32 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"HAVANA — From a two-room concrete home on the fringes of Cuba’s capital, the rumble of wooden drums spills out onto the streets. Neighbors gather at the door and kids climb a fence to peer inside. They watch as dozens of Cubans wearing white and African beads make offerings at a bright blue altar consuming half a room, asking for luck, protection and good health. While nearly 70% of Latin America’s 670 million people consider themselves Catholic, in Cuba, Santería is the name of the game. A fusion of African religions and Catholicism, Santería was one of the few religious practices to quietly endure through decades of prohibitions and stigma by the communist government. Now, as that stigma gradually fades and the country enters a moment of compounding economic, political and migratory crises, the religion is growing in popularity and expanding to new demographics. “Every day the religion grows a little more,” Mandy Arrazcaeta, 30, said among the throngs of people in his home dancing and making offerings at the altar to a plastic doll depicting the Yoruba deity Yemayá. “Right now, Santería in the country is a sort of bastion.” Santería was born as a form of quiet resistance among the island’s Black communities. The religion dates back centuries to when Spanish colonists brought in hundreds of thousands of African slaves. While the Spanish tried to force Catholicism on the slaves, the Africans brought their own religions, mostly from West Africa, which they would camouflage by attaching their deities — orishas — to Catholic saints. Cuba’s patron saint, Our Lady of Charity, for example, blended with the golden deity, Oshun. “It would mix and mix ... through this Catholic virgin, they would speak to their African saints,” explained Roberto Zurbano, a Cuban cultural critic. “That’s how the religion was able to survive.” While there are hundreds of orishas in Santería, practitioners known as santeros usually worship only a handful, connecting with them through rituals and offerings. On one Friday night, Arrazcaeta, family and friends splay out offerings of coconut and red Cuban pesos emblazoned with the face of Che Guevara, sacrificing two chickens over bowls filled with rocks and seashells. In exchange, they ask for good health, strength during hardship, and even luck in love. “It’s something that’s very Cuban, something spontaneous that we do. Because we know the struggles we face in this country,” Arrazcaeta said. Millions worldwide are estimated to practice Santería, though definitive numbers — especially in Cuba — are hard to pin down due to the religion’s informal nature. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom estimates 70% in Cuba practice some version of Santeria or similar African-based religions. What is clear in the altars dotting homes across the island and the many Cubans in Havana cloaked in white — worn by santeros their first year after converting to represent rebirth — is that Santería has captured the Cuban consciousness. Following the Cuban revolution in the 1950’s, Fidel Castro dismantled religious structures and expelled the priests who criticized his government. Religion, famously described by communist philosopher Karl Marx as “the opium of the people,” was strictly prohibited. Catholicism, highly dependent on meeting in churches and on hierarchy, withered. Meanwhile, Santería practitioners pulled from the same tools they used to survive in earlier centuries. “People did believe, but you couldn’t say anything because it was politically prohibited by Marxism. All that did was strengthen Afro-religious faiths in very closed circles,” Zurbano said. “They would keep it a secret, keep their religiosity to themselves.” Zurbano’s family would quietly perform rituals inside their home and divide ceremonies that once would last a week into smaller two-day chunks to avoid alerting authorities. Some adherents secretly wore religious garb under street clothes. Katrin Hansing, an anthropologist in Cuba for City University New York, said Santería endured because of its flexibility, and because of its perceived utility in assuring good health in exchange for offerings. In the 1990s when Cuba’s main ally, the Soviet Union, collapsed and the island spiraled into economic crisis, many Cubans found solace in Santería. The Cuban government has accepted it, but the officially authorized ceremonies remain practically deserted, as islanders prefer celebrations in more informal settings such as Arrazcaeta’s home. “It’s incredibly resilient as a religious system,” Hansing said. “It’s so decentralized and it allows the individual believer or practitioner to make it what they need it to be.” Santería is once again seeing a surge, and expanding past historically impoverished Black communities. Arrazcaeta, a white Cuban and member of the LGBTQ+ community, found refuge in the religion when he was 12. Once an Evangelical Christian, he said he felt rejected by members of that religion for being gay. “I never fit in that religion,” Arrazcaeta said. “I liked that Santeria doesn’t obligate anyone to fit into a model.” As a teenager, he began putting glasses of water around the house, as offerings to orishas. His mother, Maritza de la Rosa Perdomo, would throw the water out, saying there was no place for religion in her home. That changed three years ago, when Arrazcaeta joined a wave of Cubans in embarking on a journey to the U.S., traversing the perilous jungles of the Darien Gap. When Arrazcaeta went missing for seven days in the jungle, the first thing Perdomo did was put out an offering. “I began to beg for my son, I said I needed to hear from him, to know that he was alive. I was begging with my whole heart,” Perdomo said. When she received a call from him shortly after, she decided to join the religion alongside her children. “A religion that used to be, you know, dominantly practiced by descendants of Africans or people of African descent has now become a multiracial religion in Cuba,” Hansing said. “Santería has grown enormously.” But for each practitioner, Santería means something different. For Arrazcaeta, who nowadays travels between Cuba and work in Florida as an Uber driver, Santería is a spiritual experience. For Perdomo, it’s a way of seeking good health. For both, it’s a way to stay connected with the other an ocean away. “Today, the entire country is dressed in white,” Perdomo said. "
True story of a bisexual boxer who killed his rival in the ring heads to the Met Opera,Elaina Patton,"April 10, 2023, 5:15 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"This spring, the Grammy-winning and Oscar-nominated composer and jazz musician Terence Blanchard is bringing his opera “Champion” to the Metropolitan Opera in New York. The “opera in jazz,” as Blanchard describes it, is based on the extraordinary life of the late bisexual, Hall of Fame boxer Emile Griffith, who tragically beat Benny “Kid” Paret so badly in the ring in 1962 that Paret died days later. In “Champion,” which premiered in 2013, Blanchard recounts how an environment of hyper-masculinity and homophobia led to that fatal night at Madison Square Garden and how Griffith was haunted by it for the rest of his life. “It just kind of clicked when I heard a quote that he said, which is in the opera: ‘I killed a man and the world forgave me, but I loved a man and the world wanted to kill me.’ That blew me away,” Blanchard told NBC News, paraphrasing a quote from Ron Ross’ 2008 biography “Nine ... Ten … and Out!: The Two Worlds of Emile Griffith.” “I started thinking about the first time I won a Grammy. I turned to my wife and gave her a hug, and wasn’t thinking about it. I’m just sharing the moment with somebody I care about. And he couldn’t do that,” Blanchard said, referring to his win in 2008 for the album “A Tale of God’s Will (A Requiem for Katrina),” his first of six. “He became welterweight champion, and he still had to hide in the shadows. Why? Because somebody else feels uncomfortable about it?” The New Orleans native wrote “Champion” as a commission for the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, where it debuted in 2013 in partnership with James Robinson, who returns to direct the Met production; the libretto is by the Pulitzer- and Tony-winning playwright Michael Cristofer (“The Shadow Box”). But Griffith’s story was on Blanchard’s mind long before everything clicked into place for his first opera. Beginning in the early 2000s, Blanchard started hearing about Griffith’s life from Michael Bentt, a former heavyweight champion who had met the storied boxer. In both Blanchard and Bentt’s retellings of their conversations, the focus was on Griffith’s relative openness about his sexuality — including his struggle with it — despite being a Black Caribbean man who competed in a punishing sport at a time when people, much less athletes, hid their queerness from the world. “We talked about Emile a lot, and that was the thing that always stuck with me in the story. He was a bisexual man from the islands, and most bisexual men in the islands never really talked about their sexuality. It’s something that they kept to themselves,” Blanchard said, noting that Griffith’s sexuality was common knowledge among his peers long before he came out publicly as bisexual in 2005 to a New York Times opinion columnist. Bentt added, “For him to express that level of openness, for me, was quite profound."" Griffith, who died at 75 in 2013, the year “Champion” premiered, was born on the island of St. Thomas, where he had a difficult childhood before moving by himself to New York as a teenager in the mid-1950s. In New York, he reconnected with his mother, who had been absent throughout his youth, and was hired in the millinery where she worked. That led to him being discovered by the factory owner, Howie Albert, who encouraged the teenage Griffith to go into boxing. Despite having much more interest in hat-making than boxing, as detailed in the 2005 documentary “Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story,” Griffith agreed to pursue fighting with Albert, whom he saw as a father figure, acting as his manager. Under the tutelage of trainer Gil Clancy, Griffith soon proved to be a worthwhile investment for his handlers — and a major source of income for his family — going largely unchallenged in amateur fights, winning a Golden Gloves championship, and eventually proving to be a contender for the welterweight title. That landed him in the ring in 1961 with the defending welterweight champion, Paret, who lost his title when Griffith knocked him out in the 13th round. Paret won the title back in a split decision later that year. As the boxers’ rivalry deepened, so, too, did their mutual animosity, which boiled over at the weigh-in for their second fight, when Paret referred to the closeted Griffith as a “maricón,” a Spanish slur akin to faggot. The Cuban Paret then repeated the taunt at the pair’s weigh-in before their final contest on March 24, 1962, at Madison Square Garden. The televised fight ended in the 12th round with Paret pinned in the corner, receiving a steady stream of blows to the head, until Griffith was eventually pulled away from his opponent’s unconscious body. After 10 days in a coma, Paret died from fight-related injuries. “He shouldn’t have been in the ring. He had just had a fight two months prior with a very hard-hitting guy, Jean Fullmer, who, like, beat him to death, so he was probably still injured when he got in the ring with Emile,” Blanchard said of Paret. “It wasn’t Emile’s fault. He was doing what he was trained to do; he was competing. And in the process, because of the lack of regulations, a man lost his life. And he carried that burden around for years.” In “Champion,” those fateful events of the 1960s, which would come to define Griffith's life, are portrayed in flashbacks featuring bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green as an imposing, young Emile Griffith and baritone Eric Greene as Benny Paret. Bass-baritone Eric Owens plays the present-day Griffith living in relative obscurity, haunted by the ghost of Paret. In two acts, the opera charts Griffith’s rise to the heights of welterweight boxing and his eventual descent into a life colored by guilt and illness, whose defining moments were the death of Paret in his youth and a meeting with Benny Paret Jr. in his final years. While Act II focuses on Griffith’s twilight years and his struggles with dementia and injuries from a brutal attack outside of a gay bar in the 1990s, the opening act focuses on the boxer’s early life and his rivalry with Paret. And it culminates in a dramatic retelling of the 1962 fight, preceded by the opera’s centerpiece, an aria titled “What Makes a Man a Man,” which is sung by Green. In the climactic scene, which features a staggering number of singers, dancers and actors, Griffith and Paret go head to head in a ring that spins around to show the choreographed fight from every angle. And, as archival footage appears on the massive screens that dominate designer Allen Moyer’s set, Griffith delivers more than 17 blows in less than seven seconds, sealing Paret’s fate. “Benny and Emile had a very personal history, so I tried to get [the singers] to deep dive into their own personal history — as Black men, as outcasts — and tap into that,” Bentt, who was brought on as a fight coordinator for the Metropolitan Opera staging, said of preparing Green and Greene for the climactic moment. “You’re not tapping into that as a way of camaraderie; you’re tapping into that as a way of ultimately trying to destroy each other.” “Society is fascinated by boxing, but I don’t think that the public really understands where the boxers’ drive to succeed comes from,” Bentt added “For the vast majority of boxers, that drive to succeed comes from deprivation — abusive mothers, abusive fathers, abusive societies. If a boxer gets in the fold of the right manager and trainer, and he has a chance to express that, he’s lucky.” Painful personal histories aren’t unexplored territory for Blanchard. His wildly popular second opera, “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” which won the composer his most recent Grammy and also starred Green, is based on Charles Blow’s memoir of the same name, which describes how the journalist and commentator was sexually abused during his childhood and went on to struggle with his sexuality as an adult. The success of “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” which became the first work from a Black composer to be staged at the Metropolitan Opera  in 2021, led the opera house to commission a new opera from Blanchard and to propose staging “Champion,” which the composer adapted for Green’s voice, the cavernous venue and its large company. Using what he’s learned over a decade-long pivot into composing operas, after making a name for himself with studio albums and 30 years’ worth of film scores for Spike Lee, Blanchard added sections for the production’s more-than-40-person chorus and two new arias, which are played by a full orchestra and jazz ensemble conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Metropolitan Opera’s first openly gay music director. Together with the opera’s original compositions, the additions and revisions blend a variety of musical styles — from swing to samba, brass band and blues — through which the composer crafts a thoroughly modern, operatic world all his own. “Like anything else in the composition world, you utilize everything that’s at your disposal,” Blanchard said, describing how different styles of music can combine, even in one scene, to evoke multiple moods. “A lot of it is trying to find the appropriate moments for it.” Blanchard — who has built ongoing, yearslong collaborative relationships with Robinson, Moyer, Nézet-Séguin, choreographer Camille A. Brown and many of the opera’s other key creative voices — joked that the trade-off of using everything that’s at your disposal is that it creates havoc during rehearsals. But when it comes together, he said, the feeling is addicting. “When we’re on stage [during rehearsals], there’s just so much you get involved in. There’s so much going on — with the lighting, the imagery, set design and the wardrobes. It’s hard to keep track of it all. It’s almost like a photograph being out of focus,” Blanchard said. “But as the rehearsals go on, it starts to become more focused, and then when you get to that final one, and it’s like a sharp image, that’s when it all clicks. Prior to that, it’s a collection of different things — lighting, imagery, and all of that stuff — but when it clicks, it’s an opera; it’s one thing. That’s the drug for all of us.” “Champion” will run at The Metropolitan Opera in New York City from April 10 to May 13. It will also show live in movie theaters around the world on Saturday, April 29, at 1 p.m. ET as part of the “The Met: Live in HD” series. "
"Lasse Wellander, longtime ABBA guitarist,  dies of cancer","Ariana Brockington, TODAY","April 10, 2023, 12:28 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Guitarist Lasse Wellander, who toured and recorded with Swedish pop group ABBA over a span of nearly 50 years, died of cancer Friday, according to his family and the band. “It is with indescribable sadness that we have to announce that our beloved Lasse has fallen asleep,” a statement on the musician’s Facebook page posted Sunday said. “Lasse recently fell ill in what turned out to be spread cancer and early on Good Friday he passed away, surrounded by his loved ones.” The statement went on to praise Wellander for his kindness and humility, calling him “an amazing musician” and beloved “husband, father, brother, uncle and grandfather.” “Kind, safe, caring and loving... and so much more, that cannot be described in words,” the statement said. “We love and miss you so much,” said the post, which was accompanied by a photo of the late musician strumming a guitar. In a statement to NBC News early Monday, the members of Abba — Benny Andersson,Frida Lyngstad, Agnetha Fältskog, and Björn Ulvaeus — called Wellander “a dear friend, a fun guy and a superb guitarist.” “The importance of his creative input in the recording studio as well as his rock solid guitar work on stage was immense,” the band said. “We mourn his tragic and premature death and remember the kind words, the sense of humour, the smiling face, the musical brilliance of the man who played such an integral role in the ABBA story. He will be deeply missed and never forgotten.” It wasn’t clear how old Wellander was when he died, but he was believed to be around 70. According to ABBA’s official website, Wellander began playing guitar in the early 1960s for a few local bands before he met ABBA members Ulvaeus and Andersson. The Swedish native joined the group’s recording session for songs “Intermezzo No.1” and “Crazy World” from ABBA’s self-titled third album, released in 1975. “Lasse soon became the main guitarist on ABBA’s albums, and toured with them in 1975, 1977, 1979 and 1980,” the band’s website said. He continued to work with Ulvaeus and Andersson after the quartet split in 1982. Wellander contributed to the soundtracks for 2008’s “Mamma Mia! The Movie” and 2018’s “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” during the band’s hiatus. He reunited with ABBA for the group’s latest collaboration, their ninth studio album “Voyage,” which was released in November 2021. The guitarist also released seven albums on his own, the website said. “In 2005, he received the Albin Hagström Memorial Award from The Royal Swedish Academy of Music and, in 2018, the Swedish Musicians Union’s prestigious special prize Studioräven Award for his work as a session musician,” his biography said. According to his personal website, Wellander was born in 1952 in a small Swedish village called Skrekarhyttan. His family later moved to Nora, Sweden, where his music career began. He learned to play bass, keyboard, recorder and accordion. His three final singles, titled “O Come, All Ye Faithful, “Merry-Go-Round” and “Overdrive,” were released in 2022. "

Twitter restricts users from liking or retweeting posts that link to Substack,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"April 7, 2023, 5:10 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Twitter has put restrictions on how its users interact with posts that contain links to the newsletter platform Substack, just days after Substack announced it would launch a Twitter-like feature called ""Notes."" When trying on a desktop computer to retweet or like a post with a Substack link, Twitter returned a message: ""Some actions on this Tweet have been disabled by Twitter."" On the mobile version of Twitter, likes and retweets of posts that shared a Substack link did not work. It also appeared that Twitter had made it so that users could not respond to tweets that included Substack links. Twitter did not immediately return a request for comment. It appeared, however, that tweets with links to Substack newsletters with a unique domain name or shortened links did function normally on Twitter. One user said they were also unable to embed tweets in their Substack. The restriction appeared to have started sometime between Thursday evening and Friday morning. Some Twitter users directed their anger over the change at Twitter CEO Elon Musk. ""Defender of free speech indeed,"" tweeted academic and author Brian Klass. Writer Parker Molloy suggested the move showed that Musk was willing to hurt businesses that use Twitter should he feel slighted by a person or company. Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, tweeted that Musk was disincentivizing Twitter users, rather than Substack users, by limiting their ability to share newsletters from the platform. ""Feel like a broken record on this but Elon Musk fundamentally does not understand the power dynamics of a platform like this,"" he tweeted, adding in a subsequent tweet: ""The value of this website is created by its power users. If you punish them and remove incentives for them to be here, your platform will fail. I haven’t taken a business class in my life and I can identify that much."" In a statement emailed to NBC News, Substack founders Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie and Jairaj Sethi said they were ""disappointed that Twitter has chosen to restrict writers’ ability to share their work."" ""Writers deserve the freedom to share links to Substack or anywhere else. This abrupt change is a reminder of why writers deserve a model that puts them in charge, that rewards great work with money, and that protects the free press and free speech,"" the statement read. ""Their livelihoods should not be tied to platforms where they don’t own their relationship with their audience, and where the rules can change on a whim."" Substack was launched in 2017 and has grown in popularity among writers since. Twitter became a destination for those with Substack newsletters to share their work and accrue new subscribers. Although some Substacks are free, others charge subscribers a fee in order to access their newsletter. Substack's newly announced ""Notes"" feature is similar to Twitter both in appearance and functionality. Users can ""restack"" a post, which shares that post in the same way as a ""retweet,"" in addition to liking and commenting on it. Security researcher Jane Manchun Wong questioned why Twitter was responding so harshly to Substack’s ""Notes"" feature. ""I don’t get why Twitter is having such a strong reaction over Substack’s Twitter lookalike,"" she tweeted. ""People signed up on Mastodon a while back but are still sticking around here. The community on Substack Notes will be more niche in comparison. I wouldn’t be too worried."" "
"S Club 7 singer Paul Cattermole dies at 46, months after U.K. pop group announced reunion tour",Variety,"April 7, 2023, 3:43 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"S Club 7 member Paul Cattermole has died just months after the British pop band announced its fall reunion tour, the band and his family said. He was 46. On the band’s official Instagram page, the group wrote it was “truly devastated” by Cattermole’s death. “There are no words to describe the deep sadness and loss we all feel,” the band wrote. “We were so lucky to have had him in our lives and are thankful for the amazing memories we have. He will be so deeply missed by each and every one of us.” The singer was found on April 6 at his home in Dorset. He was pronounced dead later in the afternoon. “It is with great sadness that we announce the unexpected passing of our beloved son and brother Paul Cattermole,” reads a statement published by the BBC, attributed to Cattermole’s family and the band. The statement notes that a cause of death is currently unknown. “Dorset Police has confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances. Paul’s family, friends and fellow members of S Club request privacy at this time,” it continues. Cattermole was 21 when he found global stardom as part of S Club 7. Formed in 1998, the group — created by former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller — signed with Polydor Records and hit the charts at No. 1 on its debut single, “Bring it All Back.” More hits followed with “S Club Party” and “Don’t Stop Movin.’” The septet also starred in a successful BBC television series called “Miami 7,” which aired for four seasons. The youth-targeted sitcom — billed as “the Monkees for a new generation” — aired in the U.S. on Fox Family and later on ABC Family, following the group from London to Florida seeking fame, fortune and fun. S Club 7 is reuniting for a 25th anniversary tour with an 11-date tour of the U.K. and Ireland later this year. The group’s remaining members include Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Hannah Spearritt, Bradley McIntosh, Rachel Stevens and Jo O’Meara. "
Can English unite a divided America? A Mexican American scholar weighs in,Arturo Conde,"April 7, 2023, 3:05 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The story of American English is how the nation’s different groups have made the language their own — but it’s also about the way it connects Americans. The latest book by the Mexican American author and scholar Ilan Stavans, “The People’s Tongue: Americans and the English Language,” looks at how American English has set and pushed boundaries for more than four centuries — and become a global language. “We live in a time when the country is dramatically fractured and polarized. And some people can’t even see each other face to face,” Stavans said in an interview. “But while one group uses English in one way and others use it in different ways, we are all still speaking the same language, which is the language that is being projected from the United States to other parts of the world.” The power of American English, from the speeches of President Abraham Lincoln to modern-day rap lyrics and even former President Donald Trump’s tweets, are all part of the nation’s powerful identity. “The People’s Tongue” is an anthology, curated by Stavans, that includes articles, essays, poems, songs, stories, excerpts from novels, speeches, tweets and other milestones of American writing that show how the language has changed from the early settlement days of the 1600s up to 2022. “To create a new nation, you need a language,” Stavans, who’s a consultant to the Oxford English Dictionary, writes in the introduction. “Other ingredients are also required in forging a nation: a territory, a flag, a government, a currency, a postal service, and so on. Language, however, is the crux. Without it, you have no conversation.” "
Karol G calls out ‘disrespectful’ edits made to photos of her on magazine cover,Ariana Brockington,"April 7, 2023, 2:34 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Singer Karol G is calling out GQ Mexico magazine over the image of her on their most recent cover, which she says does not accurately depict her face or body. On April 6, GQ Mexico published its cover story with the 32-year-old Colombian artist. Shortly after seeing the photos, Karol expressed her disappointment with the edited images in an Instagram caption. With her post, Karol uploaded a makeup-free selfie, followed by a picture from the cover shoot for comparison. “I don’t even know where to start this message,” she began the caption in Spanish. “Today my GQ magazine cover was made public, a cover with an image that does NOT represent me.” She continued, “My face does not look like that, my body does not look like that, and I feel very happy and comfortable with how I look naturally.” Although the “Provenza” singer said she appreciated being offered the cover story, she was not pleased with how it turned out. She recalled voicing her concerns over the changes that were made to her appearance. “But despite making clear my disagreement over the number of edits that they did to the photo, they did nothing about it — as if to look good, I needed all those changes,” she said. She acknowledged that publicly criticizing the publication could have “repercussions.” “But beyond feeling that it is disrespectful to me, it is to the women who wake up every day looking to feel comfortable with ourselves, despite society’s stereotypes.” In the comments of her post, many of Karol’s famous friends spoke up to applaud her. Singer Prince Royce said in Spanish, “They went too far.” Bebe Rexha commented: “So beautiful.” Television presenter Laura Tobón called Karol a queen and said the singer did not need any edits on her photos. Multiple fans also celebrated Karol’s beauty. “We knew that didn’t look like you amiga and we love that you’re standing up for yourself,” wrote one user. Another chimed in, in Spanish: “A queen using her voice! We’re on your side.” The musician and Shakira are currently dominating the charts with their song “TQG” from Karol’s fourth studio album, “Mañana Será Bonito.” Her album landed at No. 1 on the U.S.-based Billboard 200 the first week of March, making her the first woman to top the chart with an all-Spanish album. The track, which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Global 200 and Global Exclu. U.S. charts last month, is an acronym for “Te Quedó Grande.” The title roughly translates to “I’m too good for you.” (You can read a full translation of the lyrics here.) Throughout the song and music video, the two icons sing about becoming stronger after watching their exes move on. Karol was previously engaged to Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA, but the couple ended their relationship in April 2021. This story was originally published in Today.com. "
Borges' literary estate is up in the air after widow doesn't leave will,Associated Press,"April 6, 2023, 12:51 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — The rights to the works of the late Jorge Luis Borges, considered Argentina’s most internationally significant author of the 20th century, have fallen into limbo because his widow died last month without a will. The revelation this week surprised the country’s literary circles, because Borges’ wife, Maria Kodama, devoted much of her life to fiercely protecting his legacy. She set up a foundation under the writer’s name, but did not detail plans for what should happen after she died, even though she was battling breast cancer. “If there really is no will, it’s surprising,” said Santiago Llach, a writer who is a specialist on Borges’ work. He said the announcement by Kodama’s longtime lawyer, Fernando Soto, that there was no will “generated buzz on social media and elsewhere.” Borges died in 1986 at age 86 and left Kodama, a translator and writer whom he had married earlier that year, as his only heir. They never had children. She died March 26, also aged 86. A day after Soto made his announcement, five of Kodama’s nephews went to court Tuesday to declare themselves her heirs, seeking to get ownership to all of her possessions, including the rights to Borges’ works and what are thought to be several valuable manuscripts. Soto said he did not know that Kodama hadn’t arranged for a will to be drawn up. “It’s amazing,” he said. “She didn’t like to talk about those issues,” the lawyer added. “She didn’t talk about her death.” Soto said he once asked Kodama about what would happen with Borges’ rights after her death and “she told me she had everything arranged and it would be ‘someone stricter than me.’” He recalled that Kodama said she would call on universities in Japan and the United States to “take care of the works,” but didn’t say what schools she had in mind. Soto noted she often gave talks at both Harvard University and the University of Texas. Borges’ widow led a life apart from her family. “She denied the existence of her family,” Llach said. “I have writer friends who knew her nephews and asked about them and she denied their existence. It was quite striking.” Soto said he was “surprised to find out she had nephews,” adding that “it was a big relief because I didn’t want the state to keep everything.” According to Argentine law, if there is no will and no natural heirs, a person’s estate is taken over by the state. Some people have raised the possibility that a Kodama will may be found once an inventory of all her possessions is carried out, but Soto said he considers that as “absolutely impossible.” “She would have never done that, she would have never written a will on her own,” he said. Llach said that if in fact there is no will, the question becomes whether “it was just a simple oversight, a punk gesture of ‘I don’t give a damn about all of that,’ or perhaps also a way of repairing a non-relationship with her nephews and family.” "
Donald Glover says he struggled with imposter syndrome working on '30 Rock',Kalhan Rosenblatt,"April 5, 2023, 11:05 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Actor, rapper, comedian and writer Donald Glover opened up about struggling with imposter syndrome early in his career in a new interview with GQ. Glover, 39, discussed landing his first writing job in 2006 on the NBC comedy ""30 Rock."" Glover said Tina Fey, the show's star and creator, told him that he was a diversity hire. NBC is owned by NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. Fey's comments contributed to the rising star's imposter syndrome, he said. Imposter syndrome is a person's inability to believe that success has been legitimately achieved, according to Psychology Today. “There is no animosity between us or anything like that, but [Tina Fey] said it herself. ... It was a diversity thing,” Glover said. Glover said he and the TV writer Kenya Barris, the creator of “Blackish,” were the final two candidates for the position. Glover eventually won the spot, not realizing he had been competing against Barris. ""I didn’t know it was between me and him until later. He hit me one day and he was like, ‘I hated you for years!’"" Glover recalled. Once he was at the show, he said, he often felt out of place. ""It definitely didn’t feel like I was supposed to be there,"" he told GQ. ""I used to have stress dreams every night where I was doing cartwheels on the top of a New York skyscraper with the other writers watching me."" The interview was not Glover's first time discussing his insecurities around being hired through a diversity initiative. In 2018, he opened up about his imposter syndrome in an interview with The New Yorker. ""I wondered, 'Am I being hired just because I’m Black?'"" he said. The New Yorker wrote that Fey, when she was asked whether Glover was indeed hired because he's Black, said that ""the answer was in large part yes; she admired Glover’s talent but hired him because funds from NBC’s Diversity Initiative 'made him free.'"" Despite Glover's anxieties, Tracey Morgan, one of the stars of ""30 Rock,"" praised his writing and comedy prowess. ""When I first read his writing during '30 Rock,' I was like, ‘He’s got it,’"" Morgan told GQ. ""The things he wrote for me made me very funny."" Glover has gone on to have a successful acting and writing career in the television industry, as well as an award-winning music career. He has released four studio albums and won five Grammys under his rap alias, Childish Gambino. He also starred on the comedy series ""Community"" and created, wrote and starred in the hit dark comedy ""Atlanta."" He won two Emmys and a Golden Globe for ""Atlanta."" Glover and Fey did not immediately respond to requests for comment. NBC also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "
"Klaus Teuber, creator of Catan board game, dies at 70",The Associated Press,"April 5, 2023, 5:29 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"Klaus Teuber, creator of the hugely popular Catan board game in which players compete to build settlements on a fictional island, has died after a brief illness, according to a family statement. He was 70. The board game, originally called The Settlers of Catan when introduced in 1995 and based on a set of hexagonal tiles, has sold tens of millions of copies and is available in more than 40 languages. It has spawned dozens of spinoffs and new editions, including electronic versions, not to mention products related to the game. “It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that the Teuber family announces their beloved husband and father Klaus Teuber passed away at the age of 70 on April 1, 2023 after a short and serious illness,” said the statement posted on the German-language Catan website. The family requested privacy. A statement from the Catan studio team on social media noted that “While Klaus’ contributions to the board gaming industry are immeasurable, we will remember him most as a kind and selfless human being, an inspirational leader, and most importantly, as a friend.” Teuber was born in June 1952 in the German town of Rai-Breitenbach. He was working as a dental technician in the 1980s outside the industrial city of Darmstadt when he took up designing board games in his basement, he told The New Yorker magazine in 2014. “I had many problems with the company and the profession,” he said. “I developed games to escape. This was my own world I created.” In the multi-player game, competitors use five resources to build their colonies, or settlements: wool, grain, lumber, brick, and ore. Teuber never thought his game would become so successful; he finally left his dental technician job in 1998 “when I felt like Catan could feed me and my family,” he told the New Yorker. The game became a family business. In the first five months of the pandemic in 2020, sales skyrocketed as people played games in quarantine, the company told NPR. The Catan studio team urged those mourning Teuber to “honor Klaus’ memory by being kind to one another, pursuing your creative passions fearlessly, and enjoying a game with your loved ones.” "
Angel Reese pushes back after Jill Biden suggests inviting LSU and runner-up Iowa to White House,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"April 4, 2023, 4:31 PM UTC / Updated April 4, 2023, 11:56 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Louisiana State University's Angel Reese had two words for Jill Biden after the first lady suggested both the winners and the runners-up of the NCAA women's basketball championship visit the White House. ""A JOKE,"" Reese tweeted. Biden attended the game Sunday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, where Reese and her team defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes, 102-85. Biden congratulated both teams Monday during remarks to Colorado state lawmakers in Denver. Biden said the matchup was a ""great game"" and a product of the fight for Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at colleges, ushering generations of female athletes since 1972. She then spoke of inviting the two teams to the White House. ""I know we’ll have the champions come to the White House; we always do. So, we hope LSU will come — but, you know, I’m going to tell Joe I think Iowa should come too, because they played such a good game,"" she said. Long before there could be an awkward Rose Garden meeting between rivals LSU and Iowa, Hawkeyes coach Lisa Bluder took her team out of the White House running. ""I gratefully acknowledge the First Lady’s sentiments, but a day at the White House should belong solely to the champion, LSU and Coach Mulkey,"" Bluder said in a statement Tuesday afternoon, praising the Tigers and their Hall of Fame coach, Kim Mulkey. ""We would welcome the First Lady and President to come to Iowa’s 'House' — Carver Hawkeye Arena — any time!"" Although Iowa lost by 17 points, Biden may have been referencing Hawkeye Caitlin Clark's record-breaking scoring. Clark, 21, scored the most points in a single NCAA basketball tournament — men's or women's — with 191 points. She was also the first player to have back-to-back 40-point games in NCAA tournament history. LSU did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The first lady's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about her remarks. Vanessa Valdivia, the first lady’s press secretary, tweeted early Tuesday that Biden enjoyed the tournament and seeing the progress of female athletes. It was not immediately clear which teams would be invited to the White House. After Biden's remarks Monday, others tweeted sharing Reese's annoyance. ""Hey @Reese10Angel, I mean absolutely zero disrespect to the First Lady, but you are 1000% correct,"" sports commentator Stephen A. Smith tweeted. ""That is a bad suggestion. Runner-ups don’t get invited to the White House. Why are we trying to change it now? I completely agree with you, Angel."" Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., asked in a tweet that the women of LSU, a predominantly Black team who defeated a predominantly white team, get their moment to shine. ""When Black women lead, folks start moving the goalpost & changing the rules. No. Iowa played a good game, but let the LSU players be celebrated as highly as other winning championship teams,"" Bush wrote. ""We understand being courteous, but don’t do this."" Reecie Colbert, founder of BlackWomenViews Media, tweeted that LSU's treatment was a double standard. ""Now, since when did 2nd place get invited to the WH with the Champs? Come on now, this is the kind of easy to crystalize example of double standards that pisses Black people off. Don’t do it...."" she wrote. Others called the invitation to Iowa a ""participation trophy"" and suggested that LSU would not have been invited had Iowa won. The double standard many pointed out appeared to be the second Reese has faced since winning the championship Sunday. During the final game, Reese, 20, made a gesture at Clark, which many were quick to call ""classless."" The gesture, in which Reese put her hand in front of her face and then pointed to her ring finger to imply that her team would win the game, mimicked a gesture Clark had made during a prior game. While Clark appeared to receive virtually no backlash, Reese was subjected to countless tweets about her demeanor. The word ""classless"" began trending Sunday following the game because of the influx of tweets. Many, including NBA stars Shaquille O'Neal and LeBron James, rushed to Reese's defense, calling the backlash hypocritical and racist. "
'Barbie' movie trailer inspires Twitter users to join Barbie Land,Daysia Tolentino,"April 4, 2023, 10:13 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"In Barbie Land, anyone can be Barbie (or Ken) — and Twitter users are joining in on the fun. A new trailer and posters for the ""Barbie"" movie, out July 21, were met with excitement Tuesday as audiences celebrated getting a deeper look into the much-anticipated film. The movie stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as one iteration of the iconic Barbie and Ken, but it also features an expansive cast of 10 other Barbies and four more Kens, including Issa Rae, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu and Ritu Arya. Every character got a poster and a description, with the Barbies holding various accolades, while the Kens are mostly ""just Ken."" Along with the trailer and the posters, the ""Barbie"" team released a selfie generator that gives fans the chance to insert themselves into Barbie Land. People can upload their pictures into the program to get their very own ""Barbie"" posters, complete with captions about what kind of Barbie or Ken they are. Many Twitter users had a field day with the generator, while others edited their own Barbie memes. ""This Barbie is doing the thing,"" a user wrote, attaching a picture of actor Angela Bassett and alluding to Ariana DeBose's famous rap about her. While people literally put themselves into the Barbie universe using the selfie generator, they also celebrated seeing people who looked like them in the film, too. While its plot is still unclear, the buzz around the movie is undeniable. Fans expressed that they are ready to buy their tickets now. "
Asian actors take on Barbie and Ken roles in first look at 'Barbie' movie,Brahmjot Kaur,"April 4, 2023, 7:43 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Warner Bros. Pictures offered a first look at the star-studded cast of “Barbie,” including stars Simu Liu and Ritu Arya, in Greta Gerwig’s Barbie world — and fans are thrilled about the Asian representation. The photos and teaser trailer, which were released Tuesday, give a glimpse into an oversaturated and very pink Barbie Land, which features 11 different Barbies and five different Kens. The photos for the film, which debuts July 21, include other well-known stars like Ryan Gosling as Ken, Margot Robbie as Barbie, Will Farrell as Mattel’s CEO and singer Dua Lipa as another Barbie. The colorful portraits feature each character’s role in the film, most of which are individual roles as different Barbie and Ken characters. Liu, seen in a green tank top, is “just another Ken,” according to his photo. Unlike the Ken dolls, which have little description, each Barbie is given an accomplishment. Arya, dressed in a signature Barbie pink dress holding a matching pink microphone, “has a Pulitzer Prize.” There’s little detail on the comedy’s plot, but a press release for the film explained, “To live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you’re a Ken.”The teaser, which includes a heated argument between Liu and Gosling at the beach, gives a better look at Barbie Land and its perfect residents. Users online were buzzing with excitement about the film’s representation after the photos were released. The film's Barbies include Kate Mckinnon (“Saturday Night Live”), Issa Rae (“Insecure”), Emma Mackey (“Sex Education”), Nicola Coughlan (“Bridgerton”), Alexandra Shipp (“X-Men: Apocalypse), Hari Nef (“Assassination Nation”), Sharon Rooney (“My Mad Fat Diary”) and Ana Cruz Kayne (“Another Earth”). Liu shares the role of Ken with Ryan Gosling, who is “just Ken,” as well as Ncuti Gatwa (“Sex Education”), Scott Evans (“One Life to Live”) and Kingsley Ben-Adir (“High Fidelity”). Other characters in the film include Barbie’s pregnant friend and discontinued doll Midge (Emerald Fennell) and Midge’s husband, Allen (Michael Cera). Liu was thrilled about breaking barriers with his role as Ken in the new film. “I remember very clearly about some of our big intricate dance sequences. Greta was very, very conscientious about who she cast. We were able to cast people of different shapes, sizes, differently abled, to all participate in this dance — all under this message of, 'You don’t have to be blonde, white, or X, Y, Z in order to embody what it means to be a Barbie or a Ken,'” Liu told Vanity Fair at the Unforgettable Gala last year. “It’s really about finding your inner beauty and owning that part of yourself and being the best possible version of you.” "
How Pedro Pascal could land multiple Emmy acting nominations and make history,Variety,"April 4, 2023, 3:58 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Pedro Pascal has been a bonafide Hollywood star for years now, harking back to his earlier stints on shows like “Game of Thrones” and “Narcos.” But that has only been elevated this year, given his widely acclaimed turns on Disney+’s “The Mandalorian” and HBO’s “The Last of Us” — not to mention his magnificent hosting performance on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” this season. With three potential categories for Pascal to shine, it would be unfathomable to imagine an Emmy acting lineup without the inclusion of the Chilean superstar. Three wildly different Pascal performances are available for the Television Academy to consider. With “The Last of Us,” an adaptation of the popular videogame series, Pascal stars as Joel Miller, a hardened survivor of a global pandemic that finds a vulnerability in 14-year-old Ellie (played remarkably by lead actress drama candidate Bella Ramsey). A genre show that allows Pascal to internalize his emotions, and rely on his physical mannerisms to create a three-dimensional character, “The Last of Us” is simply breathtaking. Quite possibly Pascal’s best career performance yet, the Craig Mazin-created dystopian drama was also a massive hit for HBO and one of the network’s most-watched shows of the year. In addition, there’s a potential history-making factor that comes with voting for Pascal in lead drama actor on the ballot. If named one of the six nominees, Pascal would be only the second Latino ever recognized in the category, after four-time nominee Jimmy Smits (for the classic ’90s drama “NYPD Blue”). Smits never won. After Lee Jung-jae from “Squid Game” made history last year as the first Asian actor to win in that category, more representation is something we should celebrate and highlight when awards bodies have worthy candidates in their grasp. “The Last of Us” will face off with four other major drama players from HBO (also pushing “Succession,” “The White Lotus” and “House of the Dragon”), but Pascal has another potential competitor in the same category: Himself. Pascal’s work as the titular character “The Mandalorian,” now in its third season, could siphon some critical votes. It can be argued Pascal was a near miss for a nomination in the show’s first two seasons. Although several artisans have been recognized for the franchise, the man behind the helmet has been not been able to clear that hurdle. Noteworthy is Pascal isn’t the only Latino acting possibility in the race. Diego Luna, his “Star Wars” franchise counterpart, is also vying for attention with the spinoff series “Andor.” And then there are the funny parts of Pascal’s year. Taking the stage of Studio 8H, Pascal hosted the Feb. 4 episode of the long-running NBC sketch show “Saturday Night Live.” From his hilarious monologue to the moments he broke character (including Ego Nwodim’s steak-cutting table spillage), Pascal is the clear standout of all hosts in the 48th season so far. Others with standout host stints on “SNL” this season include Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce and Quinta Brunson (also a multiple nom possibility as creator, writer and star of “Abbott Elementary”). Hopefully, a mention in guest comedy actor will bring the world closer to the genius “Mario Kart” adaptation the show cooked up. All this talent isn’t new for those paying attention to Pascal’s work for more than a decade. Aside from his eye-losing Oberyn in “Game of Thrones,” he was the best part of shows like “Narcos,” films like “Wonder Woman 1984” and is fresh off what should have been his first Oscar-nominated performance in “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent.” With Emmy in his sights, Pascal is getting ready to give the people more of what they want…more Pedro. On Pascal’s docket are upcoming roles in the Nadia Conners comedy “The Uninvited” (with Walton Goggins), Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck’s upcoming drama “Freaky Tales” and the new short film from Pedro Almodóvar, “Strange Way of Life” (opposite Ethan Hawke), rumored to be premiering at the Cannes Film Festival. Pedro Pascal’s moment is here, Emmy voters. Don’t mess it up. Visit Variety Awards Circuit to read the latest Emmy predictions in all categories. "
Hugh Jackman posts video on new skin cancer scare and urges fans to 'please wear sunscreen',Julianne McShane,"April 4, 2023, 1:10 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Hugh Jackman is urging fans to slather on sunscreen this summer after sharing that he has been undergoing new tests for skin cancer following a recent medical checkup. The 54-year-old actor announced in an Instagram video Monday night that he had two biopsies for spots on his nose that his doctor said may be basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer that is diagnosed about 3.6 million times per year in the U.S., according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. ""I'll find out in two or three days, and as soon as I know, I'll let you know,"" Jackman said in the video. The form of skin cancer originates in basal cells, a type of cell that produces new skin cells as others die, according to Mayo Clinic. Signs of basal cell carcinoma can appear on the head, face and neck as a slightly transparent bump; a brown, black or blue lesion; a flat, scaly patch with a raised edge; or a white, waxy, scar-like lesion, according to Mayo Clinic. The cancer rarely spreads beyond its original site and is easily treatable when caught early, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Jackman said that while basal cell carcinoma is ""the least dangerous of them all,"" people should still seek to avoid it by wearing sunscreen. ""If I can just take this opportunity to remind you summer is coming, for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, please wear sunscreen,"" he said. ""No matter how much you want a tan, trust me, trust me, trust me. This is all stuff that happened 25 years ago; it’s coming out now. Put some sunscreen on. You’ll still have an incredible time out there. Please be safe,"" he said. This is not the first time Jackman has faced a skin cancer scare, or spoken out publicly about it. In August 2021, Jackman posted a similar video urging fans to wear sunscreen after he got a biopsy of a spot on his nose. He also had the same procedure done in February 2017, May 2014 and November 2013, and in each instance took to social media to urge fans to protect themselves under the sun. In the caption of his most recent post, Jackman alluded to those earlier instances: ""I know you’ve heard me talk about my basal cell carcinomas before. I’m going to keep talking about them, if need be. And if it reminds even one person to put on sunscreen with a high SPF, then I’m happy."" "
‘Blue Beetle’ trailer sparks excitement over DC’s first live-action Latino superhero,Edwin Flores,"April 3, 2023, 8:34 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"DC Comics fans are getting a first look at the upcoming “Blue Beetle” film, starring the first Latino live-action superhero, to be released in the summer. Warner Bros. unveiled the first trailer for the highly anticipated movie featuring “Cobra Kai” star Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes, a college grad who takes up the mantle of the “Blue Beetle.” As shown in the trailer, Reyes comes into contact with an ancient alien artifact, known as the Scarab, when he returns home to Palmera City after graduating college. Reyes is chosen by the Scarab as its symbiotic host, attaching itself to his spine and giving him a bio-mechanical blue suit of armor with extraordinary powers. In the comics, Jaime Reyes is of Mexican American heritage and lives in El Paso, Texas. He is the third iteration of the “Blue Beetle” series hero, first introduced in 2006 as a part of DC Comics “Teen Titans.” Fans took to social media to express their excitement. “Miles Morales, Namor & Now Blue Beetle! Loving the Latino/Afro Latino representation in the superhero genre,” one Twitter user wrote. “Oh, this movie is going to be epic,"" one TikTok user said in a post regarding the trailer. In contrast to superheroes who keep their identity a secret from family and friends, Reyes’ family members know he’s the titular superhero from the start. Actually, they are with him when he first transforms into “Blue Beetle.” Bruna Marquezine plays his love interest, Penny, while Raoul Trujillo is the villain Carapax the Indestructible Man. Susan Sarandon portrays the main villain, Victoria Kord. (In the comics, she’s the sister of the previous owner of the Scarab, Ted Kord.) The Reyes version of ""Blue Beetle"" is notable for being one of the most prominent Latino superheroes in comics; the film is directed by a Latino and will feature a predominantly Latino cast including George Lopez, Adriana Barraza, Elpidia Carrillo, Damián Alcázar and Belissa Escobedo as Reyes’ family members. The movie is directed by Angel Manuel Soto, best known for the 2020 drama “Charm City Kings."" Soto told reporters and audience members at a recent Q&A that the film is “unapologetically Latino,"" IGN reported. Soto explained that he wanted to tap into three generations of Reyes’ immigrant family and make them central to the film, while making them relatable to all audience members. “Whether or not you’re Latino, it transcends ethnicity, it transcends color or skin because that’s something that we can all relate [to],” Soto said. “We are not a genre and we’re not a buzzword either. It is a superhero movie that happens to have a Latino at the forefront. That’s it.” The project was originally intended to be released as an HBO Max original film alongside the now-scrapped “Batgirl,” but was shifted to a theatrical release last year. Marvel's “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” also had a Latino superhero — Miles Morales — but in contrast to ""Blue Beetle,"" it was an animated movie. A sequel, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is scheduled for a June 2 release. ""Blue Beetle"" is set to debut in theaters on Aug. 18. "
"Angel Reese led LSU to a championship, but all everyone can talk about is her gestures at Caitlin Clark",Kalhan Rosenblatt,"April 3, 2023, 5:18 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"After Louisiana State University's women's basketball forward Angel Reese made a gesture at opponent Caitlin Clark during the NCAA championship game Sunday, onlookers were quick to criticize her behavior as ""classless."" Soon, however, those critics were being given their own label on social media: hypocrites. During the second half of the final game, Reese, who helped lead her team to victory, waved her hand in front of her face and pointed to her ring finger, implying that her team would win the game and the NCAA women’s basketball title. LSU defeated Iowa 101-85. The gesture trended on Twitter and buzzed across social media — a breakout moment during the final game in a season of record-breaking audiences for the NCAA women’s basketball. The exchange happened between two excelling players this season; Reese was named Most Outstanding Player of the 2023 NCAA Women’s Basketball Championship, and Clark was named Naismith Player of the Year. But many couldn't help but point out the lack of outrage when Clark, who is white, made the same gesture at Reese, who is Black, during a previous game. Politics and sports commentator Keith Olbermann tweeted that Reese was being an ""idiot."" Others tweeted that Reese's move was ""classless."" In fact, the word ""classless"" began trending on Twitter on Sunday after Reese made the gesture. On social media, many asked those criticizing Reese if they had done the same with Clark, who made the same gesture during the Elite Eight matchup against Louisville. ""If you didn’t say it was classless when Caitlin Clark did it to her opponents then don’t say it about Angel Reese either,"" tweeted former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III. In a back-and-forth, Griffin followed up that he had watched both games and saw no backlash to Clark's hand wave. ""You had no problem with any of that,"" Griffin wrote of Clark's gesture. ""When you celebrate, your opponent will come back and steal your celebration and make sure you see it. If you dish it out, you gotta be able to take it."" NBA star and Los Angeles Lakers player LeBron James responded to a tweet defending Reese, writing, ""FACTS!!!! Love to see it."" Former NBA star and LSU alum Shaquille O’Neal tweeted in response to Olbermann's post, telling him to shut up and ""leave angel reese alone."" Journalist Victoria Brownworth tweeted that the ""racist attacks on Angel Reese"" were raising her blood pressure. ""A college kid and her team won a fabulous game against a strong competitor and y’all can’t let LSU have the joy.  What is wrong with you?"" she wrote. In a post-game press conference, Reese said she has been criticized for being herself all year long. “I don’t fit in a box that y’all want me to be in. I’m too hood. I’m too ghetto. But when other people do it, y’all say nothing. So this was for the girls that look like me, that’s going to speak up on what they believe in,"" she said. ""It’s unapologetically you.” Clark, for her part, had nothing but praise for her opponents following the game. ""All you can do is hold your head high, be proud of what you did. All the credit in the world to LSU. They were tremendous,” Clark said. Neither LSU nor Iowa immediately responded to a request for comment about the social media response to Reese's gesture. The women's championship was not just a buzz because of the moment between Reese and Clark, but has been a watershed season for women's collegiate basketball's popularity. The NCAA women's basketball Final Four was the most-watched in the event's history. Iowa's matchup against South Carolina was watched by an average of 5.5. million people and peaked at 6.6, according to The Washington Post. LSU's defeat of Virginia Tech was watched by an average of 3.4 million people and peaked at 5 million. Those averages collectively account for a 66% increase over last year, the Post reported. "
Can an app build generational wealth? These Latina creators say yes,Edwin Flores,"April 1, 2023, 12:00 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"For Miriam Torres Sanchez, growing up in an immigrant Latino household often meant little to no discussions around budgets, savings or financial planning. Instead, her parents worried about one thing — not having enough. “I saw them constantly worried about money, or worried about providing a roof over our head,” said Torres, 21. Her parents have worked in low-income jobs all their lives. Her father laid down cement and tile, her mom worked the cash register at a bakery and cake-decorating supply store in East Los Angeles. But the UCLA political science major, currently in her junior year,  has taken a more deliberate approach to money and finances. She already has a modest investment portfolio, and has opened a checking as well as a savings account. Torres has been using SUMA (which in Spanish means ""add""), an app  she found while scrolling through Instagram. Aimed at young Latinos, the app substitutes the usually dry financial jargon with game-style features that mix culture and Generation Z sensibilities: Experts teach how to ""sweat"" debt at a virtual yoga studio; a lesson on financial risk takes place at a mariachi music plaza; and there's a credit ""cocina"" (kitchen). The aim is to make financial planning understandable — and doable. The app, Torres said, has made her familiar with financial terms  and tools that she wasn't aware of before, such as a 401K retirement account, credit and the stock market. Torres' leg up on financial planning,  especially when compared with her parents, is precisely what the SUMA founders intended — and hope to keep replicating. The app's majority-Latina executive team, one of the few in the financial app space — of the 30,000 fintech companies, only 0.3% are Latina-led — has an ambitious mission: to help narrow the Latino wealth gap. Average Latino households have only 15% to 20% as much net wealth as non-Latino white households, according to the Federal Reserve. The median Hispanic household had a net worth of $52,190 in 2020 versus a non-Hispanic household median net worth of $195,600, according to census figures. The key to saving and building wealth, the SUMA founders  — who call themselves the ""si"" suite — say is through early financial planning. “Finance in general is something that people are kind of afraid of, [they] don’t trust many institutions or brands. And we wanted to just take that fear away,” said SUMA co-founder and CEO Beatriz Acevedo. A key way to boost wealth building among the nation’s 60 million Latinos, said Acevedo, is through its youth. “They are the ones influencing their older parents and their tíos and tías and abuelas (uncles, aunts and grandmothers), and also their younger family members.” SUMA’s approach, Acevedo said, is working.  According to the company’s data, the site has seen 24% month-over-month growth since May of 2021, and it’s reaching about 5 million people a month across social media. A little more than half of their total audience is between the ages of 18 and 35 — and 75% of its users are female. Daniela Corrente recently became SUMA’s chief of strategy and business officer after SUMA merged with her company, Reel, whose model is ""save now, buy later."" That contrasts with the more common ""buy now, pay later"" model, which, SUMA's leadership points out, gets more people, especially women, into debt. Financial institutions don't know how to properly address younger Latinos and their potential, said Corrente. SUMA research found many young Latino consumers help manage up to three financial accounts belonging to their family members. SUMA is integrating features from Corrente’s Reel platform, starting with a chip-in savings tool in which family and friends can allocate funds toward a certain goal or acquisition. Mary Hernández, SUMA’s chief operating officer and co-founder, and Acevedo are using the experience gained from Mitú, a successful digital media brand for young Latinos they helped to co-found. Acevedo and her husband, Doug Greiff, sold the brand in 2020 to Latido Networks. Mitú quickly became a leader in reaching young Latinos by publishing relatable bicultural digital content like videos, news and memes. “If we can be that company yet again,"" though now focused on fintech, said Hernández, ""hopefully we’ll bring down the barriers and all that intimidation that potentially people have — of finance, and they’ll want to engage and they’ll want to activate."" SUMA's emphasis on planning and saving, according to Acevedo, has been especially relevant in the last few years. “This is a company that launched in the middle of the pandemic,"" she said. ""Seeing how Latinos were the hardest hit, not just with death but also economic hardship at that time, I’ve seen how little emergency savings we had collectively as families."" The app offers SUMAversity, an online educational resource with a curriculum that includes “Dinero 101 Bootcamp.” Users can learn how to budget, understand credit and how to invest and retire. As users learn, they can earn NFTs (nonfungible tokens) like “the baller of the class,” collectible badges and an Arizona State University certificate upon completion of all the courses, which can boost graduate credentials when applying for schools, jobs or credit. Apart from the app’s free features, it also offers a subscription tier for coaching. Though the app was designed to appeal to younger users, Acevedo said she's spoken to many people since SUMA's creation — even older, successful professionals — who've told her they never learned about ways to avoid debt or how to use tools to build wealth. “We have consumers in their 50s completing our Dinero bootcamps and we love this. It’s never too early or too late to start building wealth,” said Acevedo. SUMA projects that by 2025, it'll see more than $32 million in profit and growth. “We just had this hypothesis — following a little bit of the playbook from Mitú,” said Acevedo, that “building a company that was truly made by Latinos for Latinos and that really leaned hard into our Latinidad and doing in-culture content, financial tools, product services — could work.” Silvia Patiño, the company’s head of product, described SUMA as “people fintech.” In Los Angeles, Krizia Flores, 37, opened an individual retirement account after learning about it through SUMA, and opened a credit line for her small business, Concrete Geometric, which sells DIY home decor kits and offers arts and crafts classes and workshops. Flores is now looking into taking SUMA’s “budget master” course. “This would have been — like super helpful just growing up,"" Flores said. ""But even now — thinking of the aunts that want to start businesses ... it’s a helpful tool for them.” "
"Large share of Latinos don't identify with current race categories, Census Bureau numbers show",Nicole Acevedo,"March 31, 2023, 8:58 PM UTC",Census 2020,"A large share of the U.S. Latino population doesn't identify with any of the current racial categories in the census, according to new 2020 Census Bureau data that shows ""major shifts"" in how Americans who identify as Hispanic report their race. While almost 60% of the 54.6 million Americans who identified as Hispanic reported belonging to one racial group, such as white or Black, over a third (35.5%) of Latinos chose “Some Other Race"" alone. This category is currently not recognized as a race by the federal government. The Census Bureau said a combined 43.6% of Americans who self-identify as Hispanics either reported being of “Some Other Race” (35.5%) or did not respond to the race question in the 2020 count (8.1%). The findings come as the Biden administration is considering allowing Americans to check off ""Hispanic or Latino"" as their race as well as their ethnicity as part of new proposed classifications for the next census. Currently, the census considers race and ethnicity as two distinct categories, and Americans are asked about them in census forms in two different questions. The proposal to include Latino/Hispanic as a ""race"" has been explored for more than a decade, because Latinos “have been telling the Census Bureau that the [current] question didn’t really work for a lot of people,"" Jens Manuel Krogstad, a senior writer and editor at the Pew Research Center focused on Hispanic demographic trends, told NBC News. “A central issue is that the average Hispanic doesn’t necessarily see the difference between race and ethnicity,"" he said. At the same time, a growing number of Latinos who are multiracial or have mixed backgrounds do “view their Hispanic identity as part of their racial identity,” Krogstad said. In the 2020 census, 19.4 million Latinos identified as belonging to “Some Other Race"" alone, followed by 9.6 million who identified as white alone, 1.4 million who identified as American Indian and Alaska Native alone and 960,080 who identified as Black or African American alone. An additional 4.45 million Latinos did not answer the race question in the 2020 census. The numbers support previous Census Bureau research showing that “a large proportion of the Hispanic population does not identify with any of the current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) race categories,” the bureau said. Robert Santos, the first Latino to lead the Census Bureau, has said he is part of that large share of Latinos who doesn't use current racial categories. Santos has been checking “Some Other Race” and writing in ""mestizo"" on his census forms, to better describe his Mexican American heritage, for the past 40 years. As he sets up the bureau for the next decennial census in 2030, Santos has said improving the count of nonwhite populations, many of which have been historically undercounted, is among his priorities. More than 18.6 million self-identifying Hispanics reported belonging to two or more races, according to the recent census data. The data also show that an overwhelming majority of these Latinos, nearly 17.5 million, marked “Some Other Race"" alone as one of their multiple racial categories. ""That really highlights the diversity of Hispanic identity and how Hispanic identity can contain many things for people,"" Krogstad, who has a Mexican mother and a white father of Norwegian descent, said. This is particularly true at a time when millions of Americans are expanding the definition of what it means to be of Latino or Hispanic descent amid dramatic population growth and rising intermarriage rates that are producing an increasingly multicultural population, Krogstad added. The Office of Management and Budget, which provides guidelines on how government agencies should collect information on race to manage federal programs, has been accepting public comments on proposals around census classifications and is expected to make a decision next year. While 54.6 million Americans self-identified as Hispanic in the 2020 census, the bureau estimates that a total of 62.1 million Latinos live in the country, according to the 2020 census data. "
Divisive influencer Andrew Tate and brother to be released from detention in Romania,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"March 31, 2023, 7:47 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"A spokesperson for the social media personality Andrew Tate and his brother, Tristan, confirmed Friday that the brothers will be released from detention in Romania after being taken into custody on Dec. 29, 2022. Tate and his brother are both facing allegations of sexual assault and human trafficking. Neither Tate nor his alleged co-conspirators have been formally charged. A spokesperson for the brothers said they will be released on house arrest. The conditions of their release were not immediately clear. The pair were arrested along with two Romanian women in Bucharest on sex trafficking and other allegations. In January, Romanian authorities seized $3.9 million worth of luxury cars and assets from a compound near Bucharest as part of the investigation into Tate. In February, Tate lost an appeal against a judge's decision to extend his detention for a third time, Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for Romania’s anti-organized crime agency DIICOT, said. DIICOT claimed it had identified six victims in the case who were allegedly subjected to “acts of physical violence and mental coercion” and sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group. NBC News has reached out to DIICOT for a statement on the Tate brothers' release. Tate, a former professional kickboxer who has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various prominent social media platforms. A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said that the company removed Tate’s official accounts from the social media platforms for violating the company’s policy on dangerous organizations and individuals. TikTok said it banned Tate after an investigation. “Misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated on TikTok,” the TikTok spokesperson said in August 2022. “Our investigation into this content is ongoing, as we continue to remove violative accounts and videos, and pursue measures to strengthen our enforcement, including our detection models, against this type of content.” Tate has since been reinstated on Twitter, where he has continued to update his followers on his detention. Early Friday, Tate sent a strange tweet, which read, in part: ""When a peon’s father tries to pass down ancient wisdom, The peon ignores him to foster 'independent' thoughts. The independent thoughts they heard on television."" "
106-year-old Indigenous Filipino tattoo artist becomes Vogue cover model,Emma Sánchez,"March 31, 2023, 7:06 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Vogue Philippines released its April issue on Friday and its newest cover model is an 106-year-old indigenous Kalinga woman, Apo Whang-Od, also known as Maria Oggay. Whang-Od, from the small mountain village of Buscalan in the Philippines, is considered the country’s oldest mambabatok (traditional tattooist). She has become famous for mastering a 1,000-year-old “batok” tattooing technique, which uses a traditional tapping method utilizing charcoal soot and a sharp stick. She began learning the traditional method from her father at 16 years old, the magazine reported. “Apo Maria 'Whang-Od' Oggay symbolizes the strength and beauty of the Filipino spirit,"" Vogue Philippines wrote in a tweet. ""Heralded as the last mambabatok of her generation, she has imprinted the symbols of the Kalinga tribe signifying strength, bravery & beauty on the skin."" Her artwork has driven waves of tattoo tourism to the Philippines, where people from all over the world visit her to receive one of her legendary designs, according to Vogue. Whang-Od has passed down her knowledge to her grandnieces, Elyang Wigan and Grace Palicas, whom she has trained in the tattooing art for several years, she told Vogue. Her work has inspired a new generation of batok artists in the Philippines and United States, the magazine reported. “When visitors come from far away,” Whang-Od told Vogue in the Butbut language, “I will give them the tatak Buscalan, tatak Kalinga for as long as my eyes can see.” Whang-Od is the face of Vogue Philippines’ Beauty issue, which “also highlights the female gaze,” according to the magazine.

Gwyneth Paltrow ski crash trial: Summary and timeline,Minyvonne Burke,"March 31, 2023, 5:27 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Gwyneth Paltrow's ski crash trial came to an end Thursday when a jury sided with the actor, saying she was not at fault for a 2016 collision at Utah’s Deer Valley Resort that injured a retired optometrist. Terry Sanderson sued Paltrow for $300,000, alleging that reckless skiing caused her to run into him from behind on Feb. 26, 2016. Sanderson said he suffered four broken ribs, a concussion and lasting brain damage that affected his daily life and personal relationships. Paltrow, who has repeatedly denied running into Sanderson, countersued for $1 and her legal fees. The trial went on for more than a week. The jury deliberated for just a few hours before deciding that Sanderson, not Paltrow, was at fault. Here’s a timeline of the events that led up to the court case, and memorable moments from trial. Sanderson filed a lawsuit on Jan. 29, 2019, saying that Paltrow was skiing ""out of control"" when she hit him from behind, knocked him down, and then landed on top of him. He said after the collision, the actor got up and skied away and did not offer any help. He was initially seeking more than $3.1 million but amended it to $300,000. Sanderson said it took him three years to file the suit because his legal team could not come to a resolution after meeting with Paltrow and her attorney. Paltrow responded to Sanderson's claims in a court filing, saying that he was responsible for the collision and was trying to exploit her celebrity and wealth. The actor said she was on a family vacation with her children and friends and was on a beginner run named ""Bandana"" at the ski resort when Sanderson smashed into her from behind and delivered a full ""body blow."" Sanderson apologized to her and he was fine, according to Paltrow's filing. She said she was so shaken by what happened that she stopped skiing for the day. Both Sanderson's lawsuit and Paltrow's filing cite an incident report filed by a Deer Valley ski instructor who was skiing with Paltrow's son. The instructor said Sanderson was the uphill skier and hit Paltrow from behind, according to his report. Deer Valley’s website says the person ahead or downhill has the right of way. He said Paltrow had been making short turns as she skied behind her children. The instructor, however, said in his report that he did not witness the collision and only heard Paltrow scream and hit the ground. On March 21, the trial kicked off with Sanderson's attorney, Lawrence Buhler, saying in his opening statement that Paltrow was not looking in front of her as she was skiing downhill and instead was looking at her children. He said the sole eyewitness to the crash was Craig Ramon, an acquaintance of Sanderson's. Ramon, who was in a group with Sanderson, testified that he was ""skiing down the run"" when he heard a scream and looked over and saw ""this skier slam into the back of Terry."" He said Paltrow hit Sanderson ""hard"" and bounced off him. Ramon said once he reached them, Paltrow got up and did not answer whether she was OK. He also testified that an instructor approached the group and yelled at Sanderson, who Ramon said was facedown in the snow. Paltrow left the scene about three to four minutes after the crash without identifying herself or asking if anyone needed help, Ramon said. Sanderson, according to Ramon's testimony, was ""out of it"" and complained about his ribs. The instructor ""yanked"" Sanderson off the ground and then left, he said. Paltrow's attorney, Stephen Owens, disputed the claims and said in his opening statement that Sanderson caused the collision when he moved to avoid another skier and interlocked his skis with Paltrow's. Owens said that after the collision Sanderson apologized to Paltrow and told others that he wasn't sure what happened. Paltrow stayed at the scene until a ski patrol came and asked Sanderson if he was OK, Owens told the court. It was also alleged that Sanderson, now 76, had ailing health before the accident, including dementia and partial blindness. The actor told jurors that Sanderson ""categorically"" hit her on the slope, declaring ""that is the truth."" She said she was ""gently"" skiing down the slope when she felt a body press into her back and saw two skis slide between hers. She said they both fell to the ground and she momentarily froze before becoming upset and yelling an expletive at Sanderson. Paltrow told the court that she apologized for the outburst, saying that she felt violated and initially believed the collision might have been a sexual assault. ""There was a body pressing against me and a very strange grunting noise,"" she testified. After the crash, she said she remained at the scene until a ski instructor who had been working with her children told her she could leave. Sanderson's version of events differed greatly from Paltrow's. He told the jury that the collision was ""a serious smack"" and all he saw was ""a whole lot of snow."" He recounted how a screaming woman was skiing out of control and hit him square in the back. At times, Sanderson became emotional during his testimony when it appeared he could not remember things or focus. His legal team said he was having trouble focusing because of brain damage he suffered from the collision. Paltrow's team used it to weaken his credibility. Sanderson's testimony also raised questions about a possible GoPro helmet camera that may have documented the crash. Sanderson's daughter mentioned the GoPro in an email, but she said she was just speculating because helmet cameras are common at ski resorts. It's not clear if the footage exists and it was not included as evidence. In between testimonies about what went down on the slope, there were a few interesting moments from the trial that set social media ablaze. During Paltrow's testimony, she was asked whether Sanderson prevented her and her family from enjoying a ""very expensive vacation."" ""Well, I lost half a day of skiing. Yes,"" Paltrow said. The clip went viral, garnering a ton of reactions from social media users including Busy Philipps, who posted an Instagram photo of herself and actress Jen Tullock with the caption: ""Well, we lost a half day of skiing."" Another moment that went viral was when one of Sanderson's attorneys questioned the actor about her height. ""May I ask how tall you are?"" Kristin VanOrman asked. ""I'm just under 5'10,"" Paltrow answered. ""Ok. I am so jealous,"" VanOrman quipped, to which Paltrow responded: ""I think I'm shrinking though."" ""You and me both,"" VanOrman said. ""I have to wear 4-inch heels just to make it to 5’5."" In other odd exchanges between Paltrow and VanOrman, the actor had to deny that she was good friends with Taylor Swift and was quizzed on whether she is a good tipper. The jury began deliberating Thursday afternoon and after a little more than two hours concluded that Sanderson was ""100% at fault"" for the 2016 crash. The actor said in a statement following the verdict that she was ""pleased with the outcome."" As she left the courtroom, Paltrow bent over and whispered to Sanderson, ""I wish you well."" Sanderson told reporters that he thought it was ""very kind of her."" "
Will California finally allow accents and original spellings on birth certificates?,Edwin Flores,"March 31, 2023, 4:41 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"María Brenes' first name has an accent on the letter “í” — but you wouldn't know that by looking at the Los Angeles resident's government documents. Since 1986, when Californians voted to make English the state's official language, state residents like Brenes who have accent marks or tildes in their names have been barred from including them in birth and death certificates, marriage licenses and other forms of government documents. Brenes hopes proposed legislation — CA Assembly Bill 77 — changes that. The bill would allow for the use of diacritical marks — like accents — and the Spanish-language letter ""ñ"" on government-issued documents. Residents would be able to request new ones with the desired changes for a fee. “I think it’s an incredible opportunity for California to acknowledge the cultural language diversity of the state,” said Brenes, 46, an executive director at InnerCity Struggle, a neighborhood nonprofit in East Los Angeles. “Maria has an accent on the ‘í,’ and I’ve had to compromise where it’s accepted and where I can insert it.” The potential change would affect not only the state’s large Latino population of more than 15 million but others with non-English names, such as Californians of Vietnamese, French or Arab heritage. Brenes also wants the bill to pass for her son Emiliano, 12, and  daughter Alegría, 10. Her daughter's name, which means happiness in Spanish, has an accent; so does the children's last name, Sánchez-Brenes. If the legislation passes, Brenes would pay to change her children's names to reflect their accents, so they grow up embracing their Mexican heritage. “We have been too often conditioned to assimilate and to integrate, but at the cost of losing essential parts of who we are and what we represent,” said Brenes, who grew up being scolded by educators for speaking Spanish in school during the 1980s and '90s. In 1986, California voters passed Prop 63, which established English as the official language in the state. That same year, the use of   diacritical marks was stopped at the county level because of the state government's interpretation of the law. But the law was clearly selective — the state allowed hyphens for names such as Smith-Jones and apostrophes in names like ""O'Hare,"" but accents used in names in other languages such as Spanish were “unacceptable entries.” ""That is an important contrast, because if lawmakers didn't like the way some languages or some ethnicities didn't conform to their version of English, then that should have been applied equally,"" said Matt Barreto, a professor of political science and Chicana/o and Central American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""We can very easily infer that this was a move against Spanish [and] Latinos — and that other marks were allowed to stay in if they were from European ancestry."" President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, known as IRCA, which set off a conservative reaction in California and other states after an estimated 3 million undocumented immigrants were allowed to adjust their status. ""Conservatives were very opposed to that. They did not agree with what Reagan had done and so they started to push back and they started to organize. And it did really culminate in the mid 1990s,"" said Barreto.  California Gov. Pete Wilson, also a Republican, championed the passage of Prop 187, which barred immigrants without legal status from accessing the state's public services, including public education and health care; it was ultimately overturned as unconstitutional. According to David Hayes-Bautista, director of the Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture at the UCLA School of Medicine and a professor of medicine, the issue of language in the state predates Prop 63. In fact, California's original Constitution of 1849 included Spanish and diacritical marks because there were Spanish-speaking delegates of Spanish and Mexican heritage. California was part of Spain and later Mexico before it became a U.S. state. ""I've often said that [1849] was the last time that Latinos were relatively proportionally represented, up until recently,"" Bautista said. ""The Constitution created a bilingual situation in which literally it says that 'all laws decrees regulations, that from their nature require publication shall be published in English and Spanish.' Minutes were kept in Spanish as well as English of the California constitutional convention."" The state, cities and counties had to do everything bilingually until 1889, when the California Constitution was rewritten to exclude Chinese immigrants, which removed bilingual provisions in the process, Bautista said. ""It didn't mean you couldn't speak Spanish. It just meant the state didn't have to support any Spanish-language translation henceforth,"" Bautista said. ""They also kicked the Chinese out of California, and they also made English the official language of instruction and state-supported schools."" It’s the third time legislation like AB 77 has been introduced, this time by Assembly Member Blanca Pacheco, who represents the state's 64th district. Efforts for the change are also being led in part by Nancy Chaires Espinoza and her husband, Pablo Espinoza, who attempted to get their son, Nicolás Agustín Espinoza Chaires, a birth certificate with  the proper accent marks but were surprised to learn that it was prohibited. “Initially, we thought surely there must be some mistake. ...We thought that maybe the folks in the hospital just didn’t put the right mark on the name,” Chaires Epinoza, 43, board president at Elk Grove Unified School District in southern Sacramento County, told NBC News. Chaires Espinoza and her son testified in support of the bill before the Assembly Committee on Health on Tuesday. A previous legislative attempt failed in 2014 after hardware and software upgrades were deemed too costly, in excess of $10 million. A few years later in 2017, Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed a similar bill, stating it would be a “difficult and extensive proposition,"" after facing opposition from multiple state agencies, including the California Department of Public Health, which would be required to allow the use of diacritical marks. Barreto said it wouldn’t be difficult to modernize software and computer systems to allow for diacritical marks, noting the commercial market already includes them in everything from bank statements to soccer jerseys, for example. Bautista recognized such changes would only be costly if governments like California went back historically to add the marks. The Health Department's current director, Tomás Aragón, uses  accents in his own name. ""The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) does not comment on proposed legislation,"" the group said in a statement when asked about the current efforts. Other states like Texas, Illinois, Kansas, Hawaii, North Carolina, Oregon, Alaska and most recently Utah have passed laws allowing for diacritical marks. Despite the proposal in California, diacritical marks are not recognized by the U.S. federal government in documents such as passports and Social Security cards. ""The government is just behind the times on this,"" said Barreto. ""It is definitely long overdue and there is nothing pushy or in your face about telling the government that you want them to spell your name correctly. It should just be something that people have a right to."" "
'John Wick' star Hiroyuki Sanada says new film isn’t just about bloodshed — it's also about brotherhood,Brahmjot Kaur,"March 31, 2023, 4:38 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Friends rarely existed in assassin John Wick’s life, and those who did were bonded for life — whether or not they wanted to be. Retired and estranged assassins Koji Shimazu, Wick and Caine have a complicated, blood-soaked friendship in the new John Wick film, currently in theaters. The three have a long history of fighting alongside one another in the shadows of the crime world. Their relationships and loyalty are tested in the new film, as they are ousted from retirement and forced to meet again in Osaka, Japan. “The three of us are old friends. We’ve grown up together, trained together, and helped each other,” Hiroyuki Sanada, who plays Shimazu, told NBC News of the movie, which just saw the highest-grossing opening weekend in the series. “For [Shimazu], brotherhood is the most important thing.” In the fourth installment of the saga, Wick (Keanu Reeves) finally finds a path to defeat the High Table, a council of crime lords that govern the most powerful entities in the underworld. With a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head, the excommunicated hitman runs against the clock to meet with the council and hopefully, be freed of all obligations to the High Table and life of violence. In the process, he puts in danger his life and the lives of the people he meets along the way. Shimazu is a loyal friend of Wick and the owner of the Osaka Continental Hotel, one of many Continental hotels that provide a neutral ground to rest for hitmen and assassins. Shimazu, the only person willing to defend Wick, provides him with short-lived refuge at the hotel. Sanada knows his character’s decision to protect Wick at all costs comes from his code of honor. “That came from the Bushido,” he said. The Bushido is the samurai’s code of conduct, which he said was essential to his character. “He carried the samurai spirit,” he explained. The High Table forcefully enlists Caine (Donnie Yen) to kill Wick, which leads to an epic head-to-head fight between Shimazu and Caine at the hotel. Going up against a longtime friend was difficult for Shimazu. “We had brotherhood but we had to fight,” the Japanese-born actor explained. He said the fight scene between Shimazu and Caine shows the complexity of their relationship: neither wants to fight but are bound to their respective causes. “That kind of drama is most important even in the action scenes. We tried to create the choreography that each movement, each attack and each block had a subtitle,” he said. “Each movement has emotion and the audience can read the subtitle from the movements that we tried to create on set.” Fighting and violence are a staple for the series, but Sanada believes the fight scenes are more than just moments of violence — they tell a story. “Each fight has a meaning,” he said. “Each character has different emotions. ‘I don’t want to fight. I have to fight. I don’t want to kill him, but I have to protect myself.” After a long-winded fight inside the hotel, Shimazu, who is bleeding out from a gunshot wound, pulls out his sword to fight Caine. Caine gives him the opportunity to end the fight, but Shimazu declines, opting to adhere to his code of honor. Shimazu had left his career as an assassin behind after the birth of his daughter, Akira (Rina Sawayama), but his reunion with Wick reminds him that his allegiance to his friend was unbreakable, Sanada said. Sanada, who is considered one of Japan’s most distinguished actors, found fame in several Hollywood films, including “The Last Samurai,” “47 Ronin,” “Avengers: Endgame,” and “Bullet Train.” He also emphasized the depth fight scenes bring to films he’s been a part of in the past. “Action has to have good drama and the character emotion: Why are they fighting? And after a fight, what kind of emotion coming out? That’s the most important thing for me. So this movie has both,” he previously told NBC News about his role as the Elder in “Bullet Train.” The “John Wick” saga has continued to grow and improve with each installment, critics say, beating out others at the box office this week, according to Variety. The fourth installment debuted at $73.5 million, a jump from 2019’s “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum,” which opened at $57 million, a major jump from the saga’s predecessors. "
"'Turning Red' was top streaming movie in both minority and white households in 2022, report finds",Sakshi Venkatraman,"March 31, 2023, 4:13 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Pixar film “Turning Red” was the top streamed movie in both white and minority households last year, according to a new report on the state of diversity in Hollywood. The animated movie, which struck a chord for its exploration of teen girlhood, Asian identity and fraught mother-daughter relationships, beat out other streaming hits like “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” and “The Gray Man,” according to an analysis by the University of California, Los Angeles. “Turning Red,” which was nominated for best animated feature at the 95th Academy Awards and stars Sandra Oh, James Hong and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, follows a 13-year-old Chinese Canadian girl battling with her familial duties, crushes, anger issues and an hereditary curse that turns her into a giant red panda. On the Nielsen system, which assigns ratings to films by monitoring the viewing habits of thousands of families in the U.S., ""Turning Red"" scored 72.19. It led by a large margin, outscoring the next highest streaming film, ""The Adam Project"" by around 35 points. “These are the films that are shaping Generation Alpha,” the study said. “The idea that young people of color and girls will grow up and buy into a creative vision where they are relegated to the margins with culturally devoid narratives is not realistic.” Streaming and theatrical releases were looked at separately in the study, with the top theatrical release being ""Top Gun: Maverick."" Overall, the top streaming films represented a more ethnically diverse array of lead characters in comparison to white-dominated theatrical movies. Though movies that told diverse stories saw huge popularity, the report found that lead actors in theatrical films were overwhelmingly white. In fact, people of color only represented 21.6% of the leads in top theatrical films in 2022, while whites made up 78.4%. Representation among film directors saw similarly low numbers. “In an era of economic uncertainty intensified by the pandemic, studios pushed for theatrical ‘surefire hits’ that relied on nostalgia and previous intellectual property,” the study said. “Instead of forging ahead with more inclusivity and new narratives, studios seemed to limit their theatrical offerings in 2022, which also limited the opportunities for certain filmmakers.” "
R&B star Kem bares his soul for a new memoir 'soaked in the blues',Curtis Bunn,"March 31, 2023, 2:52 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"By the time he was 19, the Grammy-nominated R&B star Kem was homeless, addicted to alcohol and drugs, and meandering aimlessly in and around Detroit seeking his next high. Decades later, his story, he writes in his revealing memoir, “Share My Life,” which comes out April 4, is “a tale soaked in the blues.” As a child, Kem said he remembers feeling worthless, lonely and out of place. His mother abused alcohol and he describes his father as a “tyrant.” He discovered drinking in his teens, and he did not stop for nearly a decade, with drugs in the mix, too. He dropped out of high school, was estranged from his family and spun so out of control that his potential as a musician was only recognizable during fleeting moments of sobriety. Living on the streets, strung out on drugs, he said, was like “being in a higher circle of hell.” Finally, at 23, Kem attended a meeting at a Salvation Army shelter where he lived. There, men freely shared their emotions, something he had never experienced at home. It inspired him to eventually open up about his troubles. That was the beginning of him saving his own life. Now, Kem has had a platinum-selling album, eight No. 1 singles and is currently on tour with fellow R&B heavy-hitters Musiq Soulchild and Ledisi. So much happened before then, though — and Kem chronicles the bumpy ride in 250 pages of candor, emotion and some regret. His post-addiction life is an ongoing story of triumph over tragedy that is magnified by his place as a celebrated artist anchored in love and triumph. A husband and father of six children in metro Atlanta, Kem credits his deep faith for his sobriety and his success. He took some time during his tour to chat with NBC News about his book, his music and his recovery. NBC News: You speak to the audience at your concerts a little about your turbulent past and power of your faith. What made you decide to now go all in with a memoir? Kem: This year commemorates 20 years since my first album came out, so this is a monumental milestone year for me. I’ve been sharing bits and pieces of my story from the stage and in interviews over the past 20 years. But the book is a different animal. It’s the perfect vehicle to expound on the healing and transformation that is taking place in my life and has made me the man that I am and has informed my artistry to a great degree. NBC News: Sharing such a deeply personal experience can be both therapeutic and difficult. What emotions did you deal with as you rehashed your life for this book? Kem: It wasn’t emotional until I got into the booth to do the audio version of the book. Hearing the words come off the page, in my voice, was emotional. I don’t take as much time to reflect on what has been. I’m in such a “put your head down and let’s get to it” mode, so, to step back and to really think about what has transpired and how it has informed the man that I am today. . . it’s a humbling experience. I got emotional in a good way. I take the good and the bad, all of it. All of it wasn’t necessary, (laughs) but all of it was integral in getting where I am. So, I don’t have any regrets. NBC News: The music industry is notorious for its drugs and alcohol abuse, and it can test people of strong faith. How do you function in the world opposite of your values? Kem: I am a firm believer that like attracts like. So that doesn’t come into my sphere. It’s not on my radar because I’m not into it. I lived that life over a decade before I got into the music business, so there was a certain amount of grounding and foundation that was laid before I ever came into the music business. I’m grateful for that. And I surround myself with people who understand who I am. I don’t really have any constraints around what other folks do. But if you’re working with me, you’re not doing that when I’m around. I can’t control what you do, but I surround myself with good people. And that seems to have worked out in my favor over the years. NBC News: Your mother was vital to your upbringing and your recovery. How do you sum up that relationship? Kem: My mom, in a lot of ways, is my muse. I realize how much our lives parallel one another. Growing up, I always had my eye on what my mom was doing. She was and continues to be a major inspiration in my life, my creativity, my entrepreneurial spirit — and my lack of aversion to risk (laughs). She’s the one who tells me, “Put it out there.’ ‘Let’s see what you can do.’ I have that spirit. I owe it to my mother. NBC News: It seemed like there was a complicated relationship with your father. He was not only strict, but hostile, you wrote in the book. How much of that relationship shaped who you were and who you are? Kem: I think that we come into this world with the exact right parents we were supposed to have — bad, good or indifferent. My father, we butted heads. And now, being the head of a household and living in the house with my children and being a married man, having to deal with the wreckage of my past — I understand what my father was up against. My father, in many ways — it makes me want to cry even just to say it — is more of a man than I will ever be. NBC News: You described your household growing up as noncommunicative, and your childhood self as shy. Have you grown out of your shyness and, as a family, have you all been more willing to share versus holding things in that can ultimately be damaging, as you described in the book? Kem: There’s a phrase in the book: Silence has a voice. I grew up in the era of, “This is grown folks’ business” and you didn’t talk about grown folks’ business. Definitely, in the Black community, we keep our secrets, we keep our dirty laundry to ourselves. There’s always all of this stuff going on that nobody is acknowledging, but everybody knows is going on. There’s a phrase in recovery that says, “You’re only as sick as your secrets.” I was shy and today I’m an introvert pretending to be an extrovert. My natural instinct is to be quiet and stay quiet, and to observe. NBC News: You documented many experiences in the book, but it was fascinating that even under the influence of drugs or alcohol you heard music. How influential was music and the prospect of becoming a professional singer in the evolution of your life? Kem: Music was always a light. It was that light at the end of the tunnel that I was always trying to get to it. In many ways music was pulling me through. In my darkest moments, I could sit at a piano and lose myself and feel safe and have refuge. Music was a sanctuary. It was one of the things God used to save my life. NBC News: What do you feel when you think about Wild Pair, the group you formed way back in the day with a couple of friends? Kem: I was at the peak, the pinnacle, of my addiction when that group was created (laughs). It  was such a ride. It was exciting, exhilarating, terrifying. A lot of it is a fog. I had blackouts. I was drinking all the time. It was embarrassing. I was 19, 20, 21 and my friends saw my talent. But both my talent and my dysfunction were on full display. I could do a book just on that. It was crazy. NBC News: You and your wife, Erica, seem to have much in common in the way of painful times as a youth. How much did that fact help your beautiful love story play out that you describe in the book? Kem: There are so many coincidences, parallels in our lives that early on, when we started dating, and we started talking about these things, it was like, ‘Dude, this is our lives, our hearts are connected.’ Our stories were written for one another. There were just too many coincidences. This is where I’m supposed to be. NBC News: What is your hope that readers get out learning your story? Kem: My intention is to speak to the heart of someone who can identify with the triumphs and the tragedies of my life. My hope is that it helps them have better outcomes in their lives. Great healing and transformation are taking place in my life because somebody shared their story with me. And I hope that sharing my story in this book will do the same for someone else. CORRECTION (March 31, 2021, 5:15 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the number children Kem has. He has six children, not two. It also misstated the number of No. 1 singles Kem has had. It is eight, not five. "
Man proposes to girlfriend using a personal version of ‘Everything Everywhere’ in viral TikTok,Brahmjot Kaur,"March 29, 2023, 3:07 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"A wedding proposal in a movie theater went viral on TikTok for a creator’s rendition of A24’s “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” and viewers say they're in awe of the effort. “I rented out a theater room, did some photoshop, brought her inside, edited a fake video with trailers in the beginning,” TikTok user Daniel Le, who goes by @danyo_le, wrote. The TikTok, which garnered over 2 million views and included a film Le named “Anniething Anniewhere All at Once” after his girlfriend, showed clips from the acclaimed film and parody versions edited in by Le. “Theater proposals been done before but hopefully not an EEAAO version,” the caption read. He said she thought they were rewatching the sci-fi dramedy and didn’t question the video at first. As clips of the film were on screen, they were edited and played again but with Le as different characters, including husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), IRS agent Deidre (Jamie Lee Curtis) and a fighting security guard (Brian Le). The homemade film transitioned to Le sitting in a car, addressing and admiring his girlfriend. It ended with video messages from friends and family before he stood up to propose. In a second video, he assured viewers that he let her know that he wanted to do laundry and taxes with her, a popular line from the film. The TikTok reached the film’s cast, with Curtis posting it on her Instagram saying it was even better than a flash mob. Commenters were also sharing their love for the proposal and crying in the comments, many shocked by his effort. “Amazing. That’s the perfect movie in my mind for a proposal too. Especially when it’s a movie she wants to see again. Lots of effort too. Just wow,” one user commented. “This was so well thought out, I’m crying at 7 am on a Sunday now,” another said, which was also echoed by others in the comments. “THIS IS THE LEVEL OF ROMANCE I NEED IN MY LIFE??” another viewer wrote. Others commended him for the proposal and said he had set a high  standard for others. “The bar was SET GENTLEMEN,” one user said. “You setting the bar too high, i feel like a profound gentleman for getting a large popcorn,” another commented.

Asian fans worry new location of ‘The White Lotus’ could lead to shallow portrayals of Eastern faith,Sakshi Venkatraman,"March 29, 2023, 3:06 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Some Asian Americans are raising eyebrows after it was reported that season three of hit HBO series “The White Lotus” will be set in Thailand. The previous two seasons, set in Hawaii and Italy, follow a group of rich, white families as their vacations at the local White Lotus resorts devolve into chaos and murder. Mike White, creator and director of the show, hinted at season three’s premise after the finale of season two. “The first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,” White said in the clip. “I think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.” Fans say they are already worried about how this focus on Eastern culture might play out, emphasizing there should be Southeast Asian creatives involved. “So any Thai writers involved?” one person tweeted. Representatives for White and HBO didn’t respond to NBC News’ requests for comment. After many criticized the first season of “The White Lotus” as a shallow depiction of the Native Hawaiians that lived and worked on the resort islands, viewers say they fear a similar short-sightedness will follow with the Asian characters’ storylines in season three. “I’m a little wary of White Lotus S3 being in Thailand since S1 dropped the ball so much in terms of the discussion of racism and imperialism in Hawaii (bc it was written by white people),” another viewer tweeted in response to the news. Part of the audience didn’t seem to like the fact that the issue of the U.S. colonialism in Hawaii was barely explored with any depth, and that the Native characters’ storylines were treated as plot devices without closure. With season two’s setting in Italy, this wasn’t as much of an issue, a fan said, because “they just focused on class & tourism which is their strong suit.” "
Wis. school district bans first graders from singing  Cyrus-Parton duet 'Rainbowland' at concert,Marlene Lenthang,"March 29, 2023, 2:15 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"A Wisconsin school district has banned a first grade class from singing Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton’s duet “Rainbowland” because it was deemed “controversial” and conflicting with school policy. Melissa Tempel, a teacher at Heyer Elementary School in Waukesha, tweeted March 21 that her first graders were “so excited” to sing ""Rainbowland"" for a spring concert but that administrators vetoed it. The 2017 song talks about working together and living in harmony, with lyrics like “’Cause I know if we try, we could really make a difference in this world” and “Living in a Rainbowland … Where we’re free to be exactly who we are / Let’s all dig down deep inside / Brush the judgment and fear aside.” Venting her frustration over being barred from using the song, Tempel tweeted, “When will it end?” The Waukesha School District said in a statement Friday that there's an approval process for instances like these. In this case, a teacher suggested “Rainbowland” to the music teacher, who checked with the principal, who checked with the central office administrator, “so they could review the song together and alongside our Board Policy 2240 — Controversial Issues in the Classroom.” The district policy describes what determines whether a topic is controversial and says such matters must be approved by the principal. “They determined that the song could be deemed controversial in accordance with the policy,"" the district said. In 2017, Parton told Taste of Country the song was about inspiring hope and positivity. “It’s really about if we could love one another a little better or be a little kinder, be a little sweeter, we could live in rainbow land,” Parton said. “It’s really just about dreaming and hoping that we could all do better. It’s a good song for the times right now.” In the end, the principal asked the music teacher to choose a different song, and “Rainbow Connection” by Kermit the Frog was selected. Tempel said on Twitter that officials later turned their backs against the class’ singing ""Rainbow Connection,"" from “The Muppet Movie,” which led her to suspect there was an issue with the use of rainbows. The class ultimately stuck with ""Rainbow Connection"" after “parents sent emails to admin,” Tempel said. Tempel said the controversy over the song was much bigger than her classroom. ""The Rainbowland story is about much more than a banned song. The result of the political pushback on LGBTQ+ inclusivity and rights in schools is unfolding and it’s tragic,"" she tweeted. The district didn't elaborate on why ""Rainbowland"" was so controversial to begin with. “This entire matter has been reviewed and the outcomes are fully supported by the Superintendent. At no time was the Board of Education involved in this matter,” the district said. Tempel tweeted Friday: ""The latest I heard is that the song was banned bc @MileyCyrus is controversial. D’oh, I thought for sure it was @DollyParton and her beautiful drag queen followers! Oh well, I can’t stop my students if they still sing Rainbowland. It’s a fun, catchy song!"" The incident is the latest political showdown in school boards and classrooms across the country, which have hosted intense debates over how sexuality, gender identity and race are taught. District Superintendent James Sebert had prohibited rainbows and pride flags from being displayed in Waukesha classrooms, The Associated Press reported. "
'Real Housewife' Jen Shah's prison sentence reduced by a year,Chloe Atkins,"March 27, 2023, 10:19 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"""Real Housewives"" star Jen Shah’s prison sentence has been reduced by one year, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ inmate database. Shah, 49, who reported in February to the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, is now scheduled to be released in August 2028. A federal judge ordered her in January to serve 6½ years in prison for running a nationwide telemarketing scheme that targeted elderly victims. “I have spoken with my client Jen Shah over the phone this week — she is doing well and remains committed towards making her victims whole,” Shah’s manager, Chris Giovanni, said in a statement. “She has initiated her payments towards restitution, and we hope to have her home as soon as possible so that she may resume life with her family and work, putting this chapter of her life behind her.” Shah and her “first assistant,” Stuart Smith were charged in March 2021 with perpetrating a wire fraud and money laundering scheme that “generated and sold lead lists"" of innocent people for other members of their scheme to repeatedly ""scam” from 2012 through 2021, the U.S. attorney’s office said. Shah initially pleaded not guilty in April 2021, but in July — in a dramatic courtroom reversal a week before her trial had been scheduled to begin — she pleaded guilty to the wire fraud count. As part of the plea agreement, the money laundering charge was rejected and Shah agreed to forfeit $6.5 million, 30 luxury items and 78 counterfeit luxury items and to pay around $6.6 million in restitution. At sentencing, Shah said she had “come to terms that I have gone against these core values and I am deeply sorry for what I have done,” adding that she wanted to “apologize to all the victims and families, and I take full responsibility for the harm I caused and will pay full restitution to all of the victims.” Shah's attorney Priya Chaudhry filed a motion Friday asking to withdraw as counsel, according to court documents. “ChaudhryLaw seeks to withdraw as counsel for Defendant because the client has failed to pay the fees and expenses owed to the Firm and has thus breached her contract with the Firm,” the documents say. Shah entered into a legal agreement with ChaudhryLaw in July 2021. At the time of Chaudhry's filing, part of the fee “remains outstanding,” and Shah owes expenses for the “digital hosting of discovery with an outside vendor,” according to the court documents. Chaudhry said in the filings that her firm had made several attempts to collect the outstanding fees and expenses, including six times since July. “Defendant and her husband repeatedly promised to pay these outstanding amounts, and the Firm continued to provide services, relying on the written engagement with Defendant and the promises of her husband,” according to court documents. ChaudhryLaw, according to the filings, sent a letter to Shah at the Federal Prison Camp in Bryan early this month notifying her that she is “obligated to make payment pursuant to the Fee Agreement” and informing her of its “intention” to file the motion. The judge has yet to weigh in on Chaudhry’s request. Chaudhry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Before Shah reported to prison in February, Chaudhry said in a statement that “Jen Shah’s resolve to make her victims whole and to turn her life around is unyielding.” “She is committed to serving her sentence with courage and purpose, fueled by her desire to make amends for the hurt she has caused and to help others in her new community,” Chaudhry added.

AI-generated images of Pope Francis in puffer jacket fool the internet,Daysia Tolentino,"March 27, 2023, 8:17 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"People online praised Pope Francis' style this weekend after images of him wearing trendy outerwear went viral. But the pictures of him in a white puffer jacket are actually fake. The AI-generated images of Francis appeared to originate on a subreddit dedicated to the AI program Midjourney on Friday and were later widely circulated on Twitter. The images fooled scores of users, in one of the first instances of wide-scale misinformation stemming from artificial intelligence. As AI art programs become more accessible, people have been able to conjure up all kinds of hyperrealistic, fake images. While there are still flaws in many of these newer programs, they are getting better, making it harder to distinguish the real from the fake. Even celebrity Chrissy Teigen was duped. “I thought the pope’s puffer jacket was real and didnt give it a second thought. no way am I surviving the future of technology,” tweeted Teigen. “So, I was today year’s old when I found out that this image of Pope Francis in a puffer jacket was AI generated… First AI image I’ve been fooled by,” another user tweeted. There was an uptick in searches for the pope shortly after pictures of him in the puffer were posted on Twitter, according to Google Trends. One tweet of the puffer pictures was retweeted over 25,000 times as of Monday afternoon. The pope pictures circulated a few days after uncanny AI images of former President Donald Trump getting arrested went viral. While many people were skeptical of the Trump photos, a lot of users believed that the pope pictures were real, illustrating the improving realism of AI. Still, there were a few tell-tale signs that the images of the pope were AI-generated, including wonky hands and a warped recreation of his crucifix. The person behind the viral AI image did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and NBC News was not able to verify his identity. In an interview with Buzzfeed, he said, “I just thought it was funny to see the pope in a funny jacket."" He added that it’s “definitely scary” that “people are running with it and thought it was real without questioning it.” "
Whitney Houston’s family wants to highlight her gospel roots,The Associated Press,"March 27, 2023, 5:03 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Whitney Houston’s brother remembers when his young sister listened to their mother during gospel rehearsals before she mimicked every tune that was sung. As Houston rose to pop superstardom, her exceptionally talented vocals were rooted in gospel music. And now, her family — led by her sister-in-law Pat and brother Gary Houston — wants the foundation of her musical legacy to continue to live on through her new posthumous gospel album and documentary under the same name, “I Go to the Rock: The Gospel Music of Whitney Houston.” “Gospel was in her heart,” said Gary Houston, who recalled his sister around the age of 5 wearing their mother Cissy Houston’s wig and high heels while using a broom as a microphone. “We woke up to and went to sleep to gospel. She would sing exactly what she heard my mother and her siblings. No secular music. It was all gospel.” Pat Houston, the executor of Whitney Houston’s estate, said she’s excited for listeners to hear the six-time Grammy-winner’s message of hope and faith and the influential mark gospel music had on her life and career through both projects, which both were released Friday last week. The documentary, hosted by CeCe Winans, aired on UPtv and AspireTV and will be available on DVD. The singer’s 14-track album features several tunes from notable soundtracks including “Jesus Loves Me” from “The Bodyguard,” “His Eye Is on the Sparrow” from “Sparkle” along with “I Go to the Rock” and “Joy to the World” from “The Preacher’s Wife” soundtrack — the best-selling gospel album of all time. The project also includes six unreleased tracks — three of which (“He Can Use Me,” “I Found a Wonderful Way” and “Testimony”) were recorded when she was 17 years old. “You heard the innocence of her voice,” said Pat Houston. “You could see where she started and how she ended up with all her hits throughout her career. Any song is a great song of Whitney Houston’s. You heard her gospel roots all wrapped up in her music.” Whitney Houston first started singing at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, as a child. Between the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, she was one of the world’s best-selling artists with her effortlessly powerful vocals rooted in the Black church but made palatable to the masses with her pop persona. It understandably took time for the family to grieve after Whitney Houston’s death in 2012. Her brother, Gary, said he still feels his sister’s spirit whenever it rains, or when a bird visits him while he’s at home adding that “when the doorbell rings, I think it’s her.” But now, Gary and Pat Houston feel like they’re in a better place. That’s one of the reasons Pat felt now is the perfect time to release the gospel-centric projects — especially with Easter next month and Whitney Houston’s 60th birthday celebration on the horizon in August. “An Easter project is something she always wanted to do since her visit to Israel,” Pat Houston said. “It never came into fruition. We’re doing this all through Whitney’s lens. It’s special because this is her 60th birthday celebration. This project is definitely a labor of love for her. It represents her in such a very spiritual way.” Pat Houston said she hopes viewers can find closure through watching the documentary with several guest appearances including Jenifer Lewis, Kim Burrell and Kevin Costner. It features the singer’s first-ever performance in front of an audience as well as many others including her singing “I Go to the Rock” with The Georgia Mass Choir on “Saturday Night Live” in 1996, “Jesus Loves Me” in Santiago, Chile, in 1994, and “Guide Me O Thou, Great Jehovah” on “The Arsenio Hall Show” in 1990. “Hopefully one could have peace and knowing that Whitney Houston was a woman of God,” she said. “No one is really exempt from the harsh realities of the world. She certainly understood that. But Whitney expressed her love for God. She knew where her strength was coming from and she showed it throughout the documentary.” "
Ticketmaster Mexico avoids fines over Bad Bunny concert tickets screwup,Nicole Acevedo,"March 27, 2023, 4:46 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Ticketmaster Mexico is not paying any fines after more than 2,000 fans who bought tickets to attend Bad Bunny’s concert in Estadio Azteca in December were denied entrance. The company was able to avoid the fines after it provided full refunds and additional compensation to 2,155 people affected by the tickets screwup, according to Mexico's Federal Consumer Attorney’s office. The compensations were 20% of the price consumers paid to purchase their tickets. Mexico’s Federal Consumer Attorney’s office said in a press release Thursday that Ticketmaster Mexico has repaid consumers nearly 18.2 million Mexican pesos, the equivalent of about $990,000. Roughly 17% of the money repaid were compensations. Ricardo Sheffield, Mexico’s federal consumer attorney, had previously told local press fines to Ticketmaster Mexico could have totaled up to 10% of the company’s earnings in 2021. On Dec. 9 and Dec. 10, Bad Bunny was set to finalize his “World’s Hottest Tour” with two shows in Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Latin America’s largest stadium. On the first day, complaints from concertgoers who were denied entry began to pile up. Despite having purchased their tickets legally through Ticketmaster, many were told that their tickets had been duplicated or “cloned,” meaning their ticket had already been used by someone else. According to Ticketmaster Mexico, the demand for Bad Bunny concert tickets in Mexico City was “the highest in the country’s history, registering more than 4.5 million people in search for one of the barely 120,000 available at the Estadio Azteca for both shows.” Equally unprecedented was the “number of fake tickets, purchased outside our official channels,” the company said. This, compounded with a “temporary intermittence in the ticket reading system” caused confusion among access control personnel at the venue on Dec. 9, “which unfortunately made it impossible for some moments to recognize the identification of legitimate tickets.” Sheffield’s office estimates that between 2,000 and 3,000 concertgoers were denied entrance to the first concert. During the second concert, Ticketmaster Mexico said they implemented “all the necessary technological and logistical measures to prevent a repeat” of what happened the night before. A a team of verifiers from the Federal Consumer Attorney’s office was also providing assistance. Sheffield’s office estimates that around 110 concertgoers were denied entrance to the second concert. Of the 2,155 refunded tickets, 1,086 are from consumers who filed complaints with Sheffield’s office; 55 of these are still in the process of being reimbursed and compensated, ""with which the case of the Bad Bunny concerts would be closed,"" according to press release. The remaining 1,069 requested and obtained their refunds directly from Ticketmaster. Sheffield’s office said it will continue operating a special site to receive complaints related to the Bad Bunny concert tickets screwup and guarantee consumers their money back. "
Nathan Lane explains how Robin Williams protected him during a 1996 'Oprah' interview,"Drew Weisholtz, TODAY","March 27, 2023, 4:09 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Nathan Lane says Robin Williams played a key role in making sure he didn’t have to come out when the two men appeared on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” more than a quarter of a century ago. Lane, 67, and Williams co-starred in “The Birdcage,” the 1996 movie in which Lane dressed in drag and became a star. Lane said he was not interested in discussing his sexuality in any public forum at that moment in his life. “I was not prepared at all for that,” he told Willie Geist in TODAY’s Sunday Sitdown this week. “And I certainly wasn’t ready to go from table-to-table and tell them all I was gay. I just wanted to talk about I finally got a big part in a movie and I didn’t want to make it about my sexuality, although it was sort of unavoidable because of the nature of the film and the character.” Lane, who is currently starring in “Pictures From Home” — his 25th starring role on Broadway — said Williams helped him by redirecting some of the conversation when they appeared on “Oprah” to promote the “The Birdcage.” “I don’t think Oprah was trying to out me,” Lane said. “I said to Robin beforehand, ‘I’m not prepared. I’m so scared of going out there and talking to Oprah. I’m not prepared to discuss that I’m gay on national television. I’m not ready.’” Lane, who won an Emmy Award in 2022 for his work on Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building,” said Williams, who died by suicide in 2014, was fine with not talking about it at all, but Oprah veered the conversation in that direction. “She was like, ‘How come you’re so good at that girlie stuff? Are you worried about being typecast?’” he said. “And then Robin sort of swoops in and diverts Oprah, goes off on a tangent and protects me because he was a saint.” Lane gushed about Williams, while also reflecting on how “The Birdcage” was progressive in its approach toward same-sex relationships. “Robin was just the greatest person, just such a beautiful, sensitive soul and so kind and generous to me,” he said. “And it was, you know, it was sort of prescient about gay marriage.” “The Birdcage” may have rattled some cages when it came to how people viewed homosexuality. Lane said he found “some comfort” when people told him they realized they were gay watching the movie. “I think people just loved the movie because it’s funny,” he said. “And that’s a way of — it’s disarming. You know, that’s how you draw people in.” Lane, who said he has been out since he was 21, explained why he was so reluctant to publicly address his own sexuality when “The Birdcage” came out. “I just wanted to do good work, and I hoped that people would like it,” he said.

Jeremy Renner walks in new video nearly 3 months after snowplow accident,"Anna Kaplan, TODAY","March 27, 2023, 2:30 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Jeremy Renner is taking big steps toward his recovery from a snowplow accident in January that left him with critical injuries. The actor on Sunday shared a video showing him walking on a treadmill, marking the first time fans have seen Renner on his feet since the life-threatening accident nearly three months ago. “Now is the time for my body to rest and recover from my will,” he captioned the post on Instagram stories. He shared the same video on Twitter, writing he now has to find “other things” to occupy his time so his body can recover. Renner, 52, was towing his nephew’s truck out of the snow on a private road near his house in Reno, Nevada, when the accident happened, the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office said in a report released in January. The snowplow began sliding down a hill, and Renner got out without employing the emergency brake and was run over trying to stop the vehicle, according to the report. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition and broke more than 30 bones during the incident, he said at the time. Renner returned home from the hospital on Jan. 16, and has posted regular updates on his recovery on social media for his fans. Last month, the actor posted a video on Instagram stories of him pedaling on a stationary bike with his left leg. He also shared a photo of “The Book of Awakening” by Mark Nepo, writing in the caption that he was also focusing on his mental recovery. Weeks after the accident, he shared that his workouts and New Year’s resolutions had all changed. “Spawned from tragedy for my entire family, and quickly focused into uniting actionable love,” he said in an Instagram post. “Much love and appreciation to you all. These 30 plus broken bones will mend, grow stronger, just like the love and bond with family and friends deepens.” Renner is known for his role as Hawkeye as part of Marvel’s Avengers squad. He is also a two-time Oscar nominee for his performances in “The Hurt Locker” and “The Town.” "
"After TikTok hearing, users declare their love for the platform — and the CEO",Daysia Tolentino,"March 24, 2023, 5:46 PM UTC / Updated March 24, 2023, 10:11 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"After TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was grilled by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday, the platform's users shared their support the way they know best — through thirsty fan edits. Several representatives brought up complaints from their constituents bemoaning TikTok’s negative influence, but Chew insisted most users have positive experiences on the app. Users made videos affirming this and criticizing lawmakers for their lack of tech literacy and unfair questioning. Some took their love a step further by creating fan edits of the CEO, perhaps one of the highest forms of acknowledgement among TikTok users. They paired the videos with captions praising his testimony. ""Can we talk about how hard he is working for us to prevent the ban,"" read the caption of one popular edit with 1.3 million views. ""If TikTok is bad, why is he fine???"" another user said in a video about Chew. In response to the videos, Brooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson for TikTok, said ""We love our vibrant creator community, and have been overwhelmed and humbled by their support for TikTok and for Shou."" ""It seems clear that much of America did not experience the hearing the same way many political insiders and reporters did,"" Oberwetter said in an email statement to NBC News. ""Shou came prepared to answer questions about national security, data privacy, and the safety of teens who use our service, but instead was met with interruptions and yes/no questions as he tried to set the record straight."" The platform will ""continue to work with lawmakers, stakeholders, and our peer companies on solutions that address the industry-wide issues of privacy and safety,"" Oberwetter said. In a TikTok posted Friday morning, Chew thanked users for their support and reiterated the app's commitment to protecting the 150 million Americans that use the platform. He doubled down on TikTok's efforts protecting teens, storing American data on U.S. soil, maintaining freedom of expression on the platform and using third-parties to ensure transparency. Chew faced skepticism from the committee as he tried to address members’ concerns over data privacy, protections for children and TikTok’s connection to the Chinese Communist Party. Despite his efforts, committee members continually cut off his answers and expressed their dissatisfaction. Under Chew's update following the hearing, users continued to share their love for the app and anger toward the committee. The video had over 40,000 comments as of Friday morning, most of them positive. ""You were so amazing. I am so disappointed in our government. You deserve better, we deserve better,"" one person wrote. ""We are sorry our Congress is embarrassing. We love you and TikTok,"" another said. ""Love this app. I've learned so many cool and useful things and about other cultures,"" a user commented. Gen Z activists have previously said that a TikTok ban would be ""a slap in the face"" to young voters. A recent poll also found that Gen Z oppose a TikTok ban by a margin of 53% to 34%. "
Three TikTok users go viral for their prank trolling Truth Social app,Angela Yang,"March 24, 2023, 3:08 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Three TikTok users said they believe their video was the inspiration for thousands of people to troll Truth Social, the social media platform launched by former President Donald Trump. Their goal? To get Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely considered to be Trump’s biggest opponent in the 2024 presidential race, trending on Trump’s own platform. DeSantis hasn’t announced his intentions yet, but he is widely expected to run for the Republican presidential nomination. “If only 100 of us make accounts and post with a new hashtag, it will literally be trending, and Trump will see it,” Peter McIndoe Jr., the creator of the Birds Aren’t Real joke conspiracy theory, told the camera in a shaky video in front of Trump Tower in New York. “So in my opinion, the hashtag we should use is #desantis2024.” Their efforts appeared to pay off. At the start of this week, Truth Social’s most popular hashtags had barely a few hundred mentions combined. By Tuesday afternoon, #Desantis2024 had shot its way up to the top spot, having accrued more than 1,500 mentions overnight. It isn’t the first time Gen Z has trolled Trump through a viral online campaign. In 2020, thousands of TikTok users and K-pop stans claimed they had registered for tickets to a Trump rally — only to not attend, leaving swaths of seats empty on the day. As sign-ups flooded Truth Social this week, some online claimed they could no longer join because the app had paused the acceptance process for new accounts. Others speculated the sudden influx of sign-ups could have crashed its servers. A spokesperson for Truth Social didn’t comment on the rush of TikTok users trolling the platform. The spokesperson denied that the app ever blocked new sign-ups. “As a free-speech platform that welcomes all users regardless of their political views, Truth Social never halted the creation of new accounts, limited signups in any way, nor applied our authentication system to anyone in an unequal manner,” the spokesperson told NBC News in a statement. At its peak, #Desantis2024 had more than 3,500 mentions on Truth Social. But as #Trump2024 began trending as a response, it soon overtook the former’s top spot under “Trending Topics” despite #Desantis2024’s having nearly double the traction. By Thursday, both hashtags had been bumped off the top-four trending list even as they continued to outperform every other hashtag. Truth Social didn’t respond to a follow-up inquiry about how it ranks its trending topics. McIndoe said he had only about 50 followers when he posted the video. But within an hour, the comments began rolling in as viewers expressed their eagerness to participate. By the next morning, the video had reached more than 150,000 views. The idea came together among three friends over coffee, bacon and eggs on Monday morning. McIndoe was having breakfast with Ari Cagan and Adam Faze when they downloaded Truth Social to check out what Trump was saying online after he predicted he would be arrested. Once on the app, they noticed Trump was “truthing” repeatedly about DeSantis. Meanwhile, many of the trending topics appeared to have no more than 100 mentions. That’s when inspiration struck. “Essentially, it would be really easy to break into. So it was at that point that Peter was like, ‘We got to make use of this somehow,’” Cagan said. “And DeSantis was the obvious answer, because Trump is already really frustrated with the whole DeSantis thing. So if DeSantis becomes more popular than him on his own app, we thought it would drive him crazy.” It was Faze who first tried to take the idea to TikTok, explaining the plan over a green-screen photo of one of Trump’s “truths” on Truth Social. The now-deleted video flopped. So McIndoe headed uptown, bought a pair of wired Apple headphones to use as a microphone and set himself up in front of Trump Tower. There, he recorded the TikTok video that took off. It broke 1 million views Thursday. To Faze, the incident is a testament to the power of social media and its unique ability to mobilize his generation through the same channels Gen Z is already participating in. “What TikTok is best at is noticing when something is getting lots of traction and starting to show that same video, then, to the masses. We could never have done this on another platform,” he said. “This was made for a mobile audience, and it was definitely a stunt that was pulled off only with a phone.” "
‘Abbott Elementary’ star alleges a ‘famous TV judge’ sexually assaulted her years ago,Variety,"March 24, 2023, 2:57 PM UTC",#MeToo Reckoning,"Sheryl Lee Ralph has alleged she was sexually assaulted by a “famous TV judge” at a business event years ago, claiming network executives witnessed the attack but asked her to stay silent to avoid “bad press.” “I’m at a very public place. I was suited. I had my suit on. I was handling my business for the television show I was on at that time. He and I were on the same network,” she said, recalling the alleged incident. “This man walked in, grabbed me by the back of my neck, turned me around and rammed his nasty ass tongue down my throat,” Ralph said. “And everybody at the network saw it.” The Emmy-winning “Abbott Elementary” actor and “Dreamgirls” star did not name the man who allegedly assaulted her, and she did not reveal which network or show she was working with at the time. But she made sure to note that it was not Judge Greg Mathis. “I love him. He’s a great man,” she said of the “Judge Mathis” star. “Not him at all. He’s a great man. This was another one.” Ralph made the allegations this week on the podcast, “Way Up With Angela Yee.” Getting visibly upset as she retold her story, she said she decided to open up about it in the hopes of encouraging other women and actors to stand up for themselves. “Speak up, tell your truth, do not carry the burden of the pain … especially if you feel like it’s something you can’t work through,” she  said. Ralph said she was ready to report the incident, even calling the former mayor of New Orleans, Marc Morial, who was in office from 1994 to 2002. (During that time frame, Ralph starred on the UPN sitcom “Moesha.”) She said the mayor immediately came to her defense, asking, “You want me to send the police there right now? ‘Cause we will fix this, you know what!” But the network, she claims, asked her to stay silent. “Somebody on the network tapped me on the shoulder saying, ‘Please don’t,’” Ralph shared. “They did not want any bad press around their show, and did not care what had just happened to me.” “They saw what happened,” she continued. Recalling what she said she was told by network executives and bystanders, she added, “It’s not that bad is it? Please don’t say anything. We don’t need the bad press. It’s a brand new show. Yours is a new show … It wasn’t so bad after all, was it?” “That’s the kind of stuff that happens,” Ralph said. “That’s what makes it hard for women to speak up about these things.” Variety reached out to a representative for Ralph for further comment.

Fruit Roll-Ups brand tells TikTok users: Don't eat the plastic,Kalhan Rosenblatt,"March 23, 2023, 10:21 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The Fruit Roll-Ups brand has entered the chat. The TikTok account for the popular snack brand uploaded a video on Tuesday to debunk recent viral posts from users saying people can eat the snack without having to take off its plastic lining. Some users also suggested that there is actually no plastic on the product, and in videos document themselves eating the entire snack without appearing to remove anything. In Fruit Roll-Ups' video, a woman is seen removing a Fruit Roll-Up from the freezer and unwrapping it. As she bites in, the plastic lining becomes visible as it separated slightly from the food. “Nope,” she says. “Plastic.” In the caption, Fruit Roll-Ups wrote: “legal is making me clarify that you should not attempt to eat plastic.” A spokesperson for General Mills, the manufacturer of Fruit Roll-Ups, reiterated the brand's TikTok message in an email statement to NBC News. ""While consumers can enjoy Fruit Roll-Ups in many fun ways, including frozen, they should always remove the plastic wrap before freezing or consuming the product,"" the spokesperson said. In recent weeks, Frozen Fruit Roll-Ups have been trending on the platform as a unique way to eat the snack. A few users have even added ice cream to the treat. Some users have speculated that those who claim their Fruit Roll-Ups don't have the plastic lining are trolling their viewers. Others, like user @KitchenTool, who initially perpetuated the  “no plastic” myth, admitted that they had intentionally misled their viewers into believing the product did not come with plastic. In a video that was posted on March 8 and has been viewed 1.3 million times, @KitchenTool showed himself eating a Fruit Roll-Up right out of the package without removing any plastic. In a follow-up video posted on Tuesday, @KitchenTool admitted he was manipulating the product to make it seem like it came without plastic. ""Alright, alright. Fine. There's of course plastic in every, single Fruit Roll-Up, guys. You think I'm just eating plastic around here?"" he said.  ""No, of course I'm not. Of course I'm re-rolling the Fruit Roll-Up and then I'm reheating the back of the package to seal it again."" @KitchenTool did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, he added that he does hope Fruit Roll-Up will release a plastic-free freezer-ready version of the snack. Fruit Roll-Up appeared grateful for the clarification from @KitchenTool. ""Sending this directly to my mgr so I can stop explaining that people are not in fact eating plastic,"" the Fruit Roll-Ups account commented on @KitchenTool's post. "

The woman behind viral TikTok videos about her husband's infidelity says she's not lying for clout,Daysia Tolentino,"March 23, 2023, 1:42 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"After TikTok user Rachael Buck posted a video showing the aftermath of her husband's apparent infidelity, it blew up — in popularity and in her face. On Monday, Buck shared Ring video showing her husband retrieving his clothes from their front lawn. A text overlay on the TikTok warns ""LADIES: don't let your man go to Vegas without you."" By Wednesday afternoon, the video had received 8.7 million views. Buck's three-part follow-up racked up millions more views, with viewers eager to hear more details about her husband's unfaithfulness. In the subsequent videos, she said her husband went to Las Vegas for a work trip, ended up at a strip club with co-workers and stayed after his colleagues went home. Buck said her husband then claimed he blacked out after he was drugged by a stripper but insisted ""nothing happened."" But Buck was doubtful of his account, so she took to TikTok because she “needed validation that I wasn’t crazy.” The saga has become the latest example of someone’s personal life unexpectedly going viral. On TikTok, viewers often latch onto interpersonal dramas and turn them into outsize scandals, taking sides, showing support and even giving unsolicited advice. Women can’t win. It doesn’t matter what we do. People are going to tell us it’s wrong. — Rachael buck, a tiktok user who went viral for her story about her husband's infidelity Some viewers turned on Buck after her explanation videos, raising suspicions over her dramatic style of storytelling. Many accused her of lying about the incident for views. Others left some misogynist comments calling her annoying or suggesting she deserved to be cheated on. “Is it just me or does this seem staged?” a comment said. “Acting like that no wonder why he cheated!!” another commenter wrote. Buck insists her story is real, but she wishes it wasn’t. In response to viewers’ nitpicking of how she presented her experience, Buck said: “Women can’t win. It doesn’t matter what we do. People are going to tell us it’s wrong. “I understand the backlash, because, you know, not everything needs to be made public, but it’s public now,” she added. “And there’s no taking it back.” When Buck posted her storytime series, many expressed their support for her — but she later posted another TikTok video sharing that she felt some people had gone too far on her behalf. Buck has since set her TikTok profile to private in hope that the fervor will “die down.” But her videos have already been re-uploaded and circulated on other platforms like Twitter and Reddit, where people continue to analyze them. She said she was surprised by how viral the videos became, because she had 12 followers when she posted the first video. The attention has been “very humbling"" for her and her husband, she said. While she said her husband hasn’t gotten in trouble at his job, his co-workers have reached out to him about the videos. “I don’t want him to lose his job over this, because we have kids to support,” Buck said. “That’s our only concern right now is taking care of them.” Buck’s husband, through Buck, declined to comment, saying they “don’t have all the facts yet” because of the alleged blackout. “He’s not a bad person,"" Buck said. ""He screwed up. He doesn’t want his kids to be negatively impacted by any of this, and neither do I."" Despite the backlash, Buck said she doesn't regret having posted the video — although she thinks she would have handled things differently if she were given the chance. She said she got a lot of supportive messages from women who have had similar experiences. She also said people have told her the story helped them. As for what's next in her relationship, Buck said: ""This is not something that can be figured out in a day, and it's not something that can be figured out in a week. For people to expect me to just up and leave my life because I posted a TikTok is wild to me."" "
Unknown Jackson Pollock painting found in police raid in Bulgaria,Reuters,"March 23, 2023, 11:52 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"A previously unknown painting by famed U.S. artist Jackson Pollock has been discovered in Bulgaria by police investigating international art smugglers, officials said. The work could be worth up to 50 million euros ($54 million), Bulgarian National Radio reported, citing experts. Several people, including Bulgarian citizens, were arrested in the international operation, state news agency BTA reported on Tuesday. The report did not give a description of the painting or any other details on the work. Pollock, a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 50s, was known for his technique of pouring, dribbling and dripping paint in wild patterns onto large canvases. He died in 1956. “This is an international operation with the participation of Europol, Greece and other countries,” Petar Todorov, Bulgaria’s Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said, according to the Novinite news agency. “To our great joy, we managed to establish and keep this painting and at the moment the expertise shows that it is an original.” "
Jake Paul and Lindsay Lohan among new batch of celebrities charged by SEC over crypto promotions,Uwa Ede-Osifo,"March 22, 2023, 11:55 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced civil charges Wednesday against eight celebrities, alleging they illegally promoted cryptocurrencies Tronix and/or BitTorrent ""without disclosing that they were compensated for doing so and the amount of their compensation."" They are actor Lindsay Lohan, YouTuber Jake Paul, adult film performer Michele Mason (Kendra Lust) and musicians Aliaune Thiam (Akon), DeAndre Cortez Way (Soulja Boy), Austin Mahone, Miles Parks McCollum (Lil Yachty) and Shaffer Smith (Ne-Yo). Most of the celebrities, excluding Soulja Boy and Mahone, agreed to pay over $400,000 in penalties and interest to settle the charges, the SEC said in its release, noting that the payment does not signal an acceptance or a denial of the SEC’s allegations. The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for Southern New York, also brought charges against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun and three of his companies: Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation Ltd. and Rainberry Inc. (formerly BitTorrent). He was charged with securities fraud, accused of the unregulated offer and sale of securities, market manipulation through extensive wash trading and ""orchestrating a scheme to pay celebrities to tout TRX and BTT without disclosing their compensation,"" the news release said, referring to Tronix and BitTorrent. ""Wash trading"" is the simultaneous purchase and sale of securities to create the appearance of active trading. The SEC alleges that Sun and his companies offered and sold Tronix and BitTorrent ""as investments through multiple unregistered 'bounty programs,' which directed interested parties to promote the tokens on social media, join and recruit others to Tron-affiliated Telegram and Discord channels, and create BitTorrent accounts in exchange for TRX and BTT distributions."" Discord is a private chatroom and messaging platform that is popular with gaming influencers and, more recently, financial influencers. According to the SEC, each of the unregistered offers and sales violated Section 5 of the Securities Act, which requires all nonexempt securities to be registered with the SEC. A spokesperson for Paul declined to comment. A spokesperson for Lohan said in an email that ""Lindsay was contacted in March 2022 and was unaware of the disclosure requirement,"" adding, ""She agreed to pay a fine to resolve the matter."" Representatives for Sun and the other celebrities named in the complaint did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sun generated a profit of $31 million from illegal sales of his crypto token Tronix, SEC officials said. He directed his employees to conduct over 600,000 wash trades of Tronix between the two crypto asset trading platforms he controlled, according to the SEC. “This case demonstrates again the high risk investors face when crypto asset securities are offered and sold without proper disclosure,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement Wednesday. It is not the first time the SEC has disciplined major celebrities for their promotion of crypto. In February, NBA Hall of Famer Paul Pierce settled with the SEC over allegations he unlawfully touted and made misleading statements about a “crypto asset security,"" CNBC reported. Pierce promoted EMAX tokens, a crypto asset offered by EthereumMax, on Twitter while failing to disclose that he was paid for his promotion, the SEC alleged. Pierce did not admit or deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement and said he would pay a $1.1 million penalty and disgorge “approximately $240,000,” according to the SEC. “This case is yet another reminder to celebrities: The law requires you to disclose to the public from whom and how much you are getting paid to promote investment in securities, and you can’t lie to investors when you tout a security,” Gensler said in a statement at the time. In October, Kim Kardashian agreed to pay a $1.26 million fine after federal regulators said she failed to disclose she was paid $250,000 to publish an Instagram post about EMAX tokens, the SEC said in a statement. The SEC charged seven social media influencers with securities fraud in December. The influencers executed a “pump and dump” scheme, the SEC said, in which they encouraged their Twitter and Discord followers to buy stocks they had also bought so the group could profit from artificially inflated share prices.

Four Latinos' deep cultural imprint is recognized with nation's highest arts honors,Edwin Flores,"March 22, 2023, 9:38 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Four Latinos who have made their mark in music, art and literature across the decades are now recipients of one of the country's highest honors. Acclaimed music artist José Feliciano, visual artist and muralist Judith Baca, and graphic artist and painter Antonio Martorell were honored with the National Medal of Arts, while poet Richard Blanco was awarded the National Humanities Medal. The four artists were part of a group recognized by President Joe Biden at a ceremony at the White House on Tuesday. Trailblazing music icon José Feliciano, 77, is known around the globe for his chart-topping hits like “Feliz Navidad” and his rendition of “Light My Fire.” Considered one of the first Latino artist to cross over into the English market, paving the way for others, the Puerto Rican musician’s career has spanned 60 years and has garnered him more than 45 gold and platinum records, multiple Grammy wins and nominations, and Billboard’s first Legend Award. “Blind since birth, he picked up a guitar at age 9. A pioneering art — artist bridging cultures and styles, winning Grammys, and opening doors for generations of Latino artists and the heart of our nation,” Biden said of Feliciano, who couldn’t accept the award because he was touring. Feliciano has produced more than 600 songs and released 60 albums. Medal recipient Judith Baca’s work has left a deep imprint in California’s cultural history. Baca, 76, is most known for ""The Great Wall of Los Angeles,"" which spans a half-mile and focuses on California’s ethnic history. The project was recognized by the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Baca, who was born in Los Angeles to Mexican American parents, is the artistic director of the Social and Public Art Resource Center, or SPARC, Los Angeles’ first mural program, which she helped co-found. The program has produced more than 400 murals in the city since 1974. Her large-scale public artworks focus on the lives and communities of diverse Californians including women and youth and immigrant communities. Baca is also an emeritus professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Her groundbreaking murals depict the strength and scope of human nature and tell the forgotten stories — and tell a fuller story of who we are as Americans,” Biden said of Baca's work. Puerto Rican painter, graphic artist and writer Antonio Martorell  was honored for his contributions as “one of Puerto Rico’s greatest cultural ambassadors,” Biden said. Martorell has created prolific contemporary art pieces that are displayed in exhibits in Puerto Rico, the U.S. and abroad. Having created early poster drawings of the Puerto Rican experience in his early career, his work was crucial to the development of posters as a form of expression during social commentary in the 1960s and 1970s. ""His work challenges and unites people across languages, classes and generations,"" Biden said. ""His creations span genres — painting, writing, sculpture, theater design. Always daring to try something new while building on what came before."" The National Medal of Arts — given to Feliciano, Baca and Martorell — is awarded to those who have contributed to excellence and growth of the arts in the U.S. Richard Blanco, who was the nation's first Latino and openly gay inaugural poet, was recognized with a National Humanities Medal, which is awarded to people who have helped deepen and broaden humanities with contributions in history, literature and philosophy, among other subjects. The Cuban American poet's work has spurred public discourse by taking on controversial topics like immigration, race and gun violence, hoping to make sense of the issues. Blanco, who is also an author, professor and public speaker, read the inaugural poem at President Barack Obama’s second inauguration, in 2013. He also wrote a poem for the historic reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015. “His poetry bridges cultures and languages — a mosaic of our past, our present and our future — reflecting a nation that is hectic, colorful and still becoming,” Biden said. “Richard Blanco’s powerful storytelling challenges the boundaries of culture, gender and class while celebrating the promise of our nation’s highest ideals.” “Poetry truly understands that and uses language to make us feel and think of things in new ways,” Blanco told NBC News in a 2021 interview. “That’s how it can help heal us — by asking questions we aren’t asking of ourselves and others, by changing the conversation, the rhetoric, the discourse, so that we can see beyond abstract language of sociopolitical jargon and arrive at greater truths.” In total, 24 people and organizations were recognized at the White House, including music artists Bruce Springsteen and Gladys Knight,  actor Mindy Kaling, and designer Vera Wang. “The work of our honorees is as diverse as the nation that celebrates with them today,” Biden said. “But common threads weave them together in many ways in the very fabric of America: the pursuit of excellence, the drive to create, the yearning to connect, and the boldness to be truth tellers, bridge builders and change seekers.” The honorees were supposed to be recognized in 2021, but the ceremony was delayed by the pandemic.

‘A Snowy Day in Oakland’ explores a 'taboo topic' in some communities,Arturo Conde,"March 22, 2023, 5:22 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"While seeking therapy from a psychologist can seem like a “luxury” for some, there's a healing power to talking, according to actor Claudia Zevallos. Zevallos plays the co-owner of a bodega — along with the character of her father, played by Cuban American actor Tony Planas — in the new comedy, ""A Snowy Day in Oakland,"" which premiered nationwide in theaters Friday. The movie, which blends elements of psychology with comedy, tells the story of LaTrice Monroe, an upscale San Francisco psychologist — played by Nicole Ari Parker — who after a breakup decides to open a private practice named “HeadShop” in a predominantly Black neighborhood. For Zevallos, who most recently starred in last year's film ""Tyson's Run,"" the movie's storyline around the way therapy and mental health are perceived is relatable. “It’s a bit of a taboo topic in our community. So what we Latinos do is we talk to the prima, the cousin, we talk to our best friend, or else we go to church,” the Peruvian actor said. “And this is the way we’ve dealt with our problems. So going to a psychologist is something foreign for us.” “I think ‘A Snowy Day in Oakland’ has an underlying message: 'We hear you. We see you. We understand you,''"" Zevallos said. “It’s about when everyone comes together, anything could be possible. And it’s ok to be you.” The film was written and directed by Kim Bass, creator of the 1990s sitcom “Sister, Sister,” which featured Tia and Tamera Mowry as twins who were reunited as teenagers after getting separated at birth. Plana, memorably remembered by fans as Betty Suárez’s father, Ignacio, on the ABC television sitcom “Ugly Betty,"" said the movie spoke to his experiences. “African Americans and Latino communities live with each other, next to each other, everywhere in this country,” he said. “A lot of us are working class. A lot of us are fighting for better economic results than what we have.” In the film, as LaTrice helps her neighbors get comfortable examining themselves, they learn to address the obstacles that stand in the way of their dreams. And this progress, Plana highlights, shows viewers a fuller representation of diverse characters. “We’re still struggling to be represented in a fully human way, you know, away from stereotypes,” he said, referring to characters on TV and film. “One of the things I love about ‘A Snowy Day’ is that it allows us to be who we are — people.” "
A woman wearing 'Law & Order: SVU' shirt runs into Mariska Hargitay on her flight,"MC Suhocki, TODAY","March 22, 2023, 3:43 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"A last-minute decision to change into a comfy shirt ended up leading to one of the best moments of “Law & Order: SVU” fan Taylor Colson’s life. On Monday, ""SVU"" star Mariska Hargitay shared a photo of a woman wearing a T-shirt with her iconic character, Olivia Benson, and fan-favorite character Elliot Stabler (Chris Meloni) on the front to her Instagram story. Hargitay posted the photo with no text or context, which had fans on Twitter wondering: Who is “shirt girl”? The next day, “shirt girl” shared her story in a video on her TikTok account. “WHEN YOU ARE WEARING YOUR SVU SHIRT & OLIVIA BENSON IS ON YOUR FLIGHT,” Colson wrote. She shared photos from the flight and screengrabs of text messages with friends set to Meghan Trainor’s song “Mother.” “mariska is my mother,” Colson wrote at the end of her caption, along with the hashtags #svu and #dreamsdocometrue. So, what did Hargitay say to Colson when she saw her in the “SVU” shirt? Colson tells TODAY.com: “‘The universe could not have made this happen more.’” The singer-songwriter was about to leave her house to catch her flight when she was “so uncomfortable” wearing “a little baby tee,” she opted to “put on something baggy” and switched into her “SVU” shirt. “I almost didn’t even wear it,” she recalls. The 27-year-old from Los Angeles says she’s been a “Law & Order: SVU” fan “forever” and has “seen every episode probably 20 times.” Colson first spotted Hargitay boarding the plane and couldn’t believe she was about to be on the same flight as the actor while wearing her “SVU” shirt. “I started freaking out, and normally I would never go up to anybody,” she explains. “I’m in the music business, and I would never go up to someone. She was with her whole family.” Colson adds that because she happened to be wearing the shirt, she thought if she saw Hargitay on the plane, “It’s meant to be.” Once on board, Colson saw Hargitay already sitting and happened to end up standing next to her. “I was like, ‘OK, I just have to tell you — this is too funny,’ and I pointed at the shirt,” she says. “She’s like, ‘Oh, my God!’ She’s like, ‘No way.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, it’s so nice to meet you.’” Hargitay then told Colson she had to take a picture and said she had “never seen anybody wearing a shirt like this in real life.” Colson then told Hargitay, after the actor asked, that she got the shirt on Etsy. “She made me turn around and show her kids,” Colson says. Hargitay shares three children with husband Peter Hermann: August, 16, Amaya, 11, and Andrew, 11. “Then she took a photo of me,” Colson adds, “and then she’s like, ‘We have to take a photo when we land. You deserve it.’” After Colson found her seat, she thought, “Great, how am I going to make it through a 3 1/2-hour flight right now?” She began texting friends about the experience, and they said, “Imagine if she posts you on her (Instagram) story.” True to her word, Hargitay took a photo with Colson after the plane landed, and the two had “a great conversation.” “She was so, so nice,” Colson says of Hargitay. “When I saw her after the flight, she’s like, ‘Did you see that I posted you on my story?’” Colson recalls of her conversation with Hargitay, saying she responded she had not because she hadn’t been on Instagram. “She’s like, ‘I think I posted it, let me check.’ And she pulled out her phone, and she went on her Instagram. She’s like, ‘Yep! Look, it’s here,’ and showed me.” "

A video posted on social media showed 6ix9ine, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, walking through the gym with blood on his face. ""He had cuts to his face and bruises.

Gisele Bündchen talks co-parenting with Tom Brady’s ex Bridget Moynahan: ‘We are team players’,"Drew Weisholtz, TODAY","March 22, 2023, 12:44 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Gisele Bündchen says she and Bridget Moynahan have come a long way together. Bündchen, who jointly announced her divorce from Tom Brady last year, says she and Brady’s ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan, who shares son Jack with the legendary NFL quarterback, have learned to get along. “I say to Bridget — you know, I have a great relationship with her ...” Bündchen told Vanity Fair. “Everything in life comes with work. You have to go through the roller coaster. You have moments where you get to the sticky points and you gotta overcome it.” So, did the pair always get along? “No!” Bündchen said. Brady, Bündchen and Moynahan have a non-traditional relationship. Brady and Moynahan broke up in December 2006, right around the time he began dating Bündchen. In August 2007, Moynahan gave birth to Jack, her son with Brady. The supermodel, 42, and Moynahan, 51, didn’t meet for more than a year following Jack’s birth and eventually, the two women did come face-to-face and learned to co-exist. “Love conquers all,” Bündchen said about her own experiences with Moynahan and Jack. “My life became so much richer because I got to learn so much from that.” “Nothing is worth fighting (over),” she added. Bündchen and Brady married in 2009 and would go on to have two kids, Benjamin, 13 and Vivian, 10. She says she tried to do her best to make things as smooth as possible when it came to Moynahan. “My goal was always, how can I be the most helpful? How can I make it the easiest I possibly can?” she said. “I put myself in her shoes and I was like, ‘How can I support her?’ Because in the end of the day, we are team players in ‘How are we going to do this so (Jack) can have the best life?’” She also says she and Brady are not out to hurt each other. “We’re not playing against each other,” she said. “We are a team and that’s beautiful. I look back and I have no regrets. I loved every bit of it.” Bündchen also has a place in her heart for Jack. “I love him so much,” she said. Moynahan, who has been married to businessman Andrew Frankel since 2015, has also spoken about the challenges and rewards of co-parenting. “Tom and I made a decision to raise a child together, and we both found partners that not only supported us in raising that child but also loved our child as if he was their own,” she told People in 2019. “I don’t think you can ask for more than that,” she added. “My son is surrounded by love.” "
'Winnie the Pooh' horror film is mysteriously pulled from Hong Kong theaters,Kamakshi Gupta,"March 22, 2023, 11:27 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"HONG KONG — Public screenings of the British horror film “Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey” have been abruptly called off in Hong Kong, adding to worries about growing censorship in the Chinese territory. Film distributor VII Pillars Entertainment announced with “great regret” Tuesday that the film’s release Thursday in Hong Kong and the neighboring Chinese territory of Macau had been canceled, without giving a reason. “We are incredibly sorry for the disappointment and inconvenience,” it said on Facebook. Earlier, it had listed 30 movie theaters around Hong Kong where the film was set to be screened. It did not respond to requests for additional comment. A screening that had been planned for Tuesday night was also canceled because of “technical reasons,” the organizer, Moviematic, said on Instagram. The Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration, or OFNAA, which enforces Hong Kong’s film classification and censorship rules, said it had issued a certificate of approval for the film to be screened. “The arrangements of cinemas in Hong Kong on the screening of individual films with certificates of approval in their premises are the commercial decisions of the cinemas concerned, and OFNAA would not comment on such arrangements,” it said in a statement. Winnie the Pooh has been a sensitive topic in China since 2013, when a photo of Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama strolling together in California inspired Chinese internet users to compare them to the bumbling bear and his irrepressible friend Tigger. The Pooh character has become a lighthearted, parodic way to refer to Xi, who recently secured an unprecedented third term in office, as well as a way to express dissent. References to the bear have been censored on Chinese social media, and the 2018 Disney film “Christopher Robin,” which also featured Winnie the Pooh, was denied a release in mainland China. Concerns about censorship have been rising in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was promised 50 years of continued rights and freedoms when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, as the government cracks down after months of pro-democracy protests in 2019. In 2020, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law that it says was necessary to restore stability, and in 2021 Hong Kong passed a bill allowing officials to bar films deemed “contrary” to national security interests. The city of more than 7 million, which lifted its last major “zero-Covid” restrictions only this month, is trying to revive its economy and its reputation as an international financial hub with the full-scale return of cultural and sporting events such as the Asia edition of Art Basel, which starts Thursday. Kenny Ng, a film censorship expert at Hong Kong Baptist University, said that while no official reason had been given for pulling “Winnie the Pooh,” it “may not be too surprising in the current situation.” “Surely any reference, however vague and imaginative, to political leaders in films are taboos in cinema today,” he said in an email. The slasher take on “Winnie the Pooh” was made possible only because the copyright on English author A.A. Milne’s 1926 book expired on Jan. 1 last year, thrusting Pooh and other residents of the Hundred Acre Wood into the public domain. In coming years the public will gain access to numerous other pop culture icons, including the original version of Mickey Mouse, from “Steamboat Willie,” whose copyright expires next year. "
"Gwyneth Paltrow caused 2016 Utah skiing accident, witness testifies as trial opens",Doha Madani,"March 22, 2023, 12:15 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"An eyewitness testified Tuesday that actor Gwyneth Paltrow crashed into another skier, injuring him, in an accident at Utah’s Deer Valley Resort in 2016, a sequence of events Paltrow's lawyer disputed. Paltrow was in court for the first day of the trial in Summit County, Utah, where she is accused of causing Terry Sanderson ""to suffer a concussion, brain injury and four broken ribs,"" according to an initial lawsuit filing. Paltrow denies being at fault in the Feb. 26, 2016, accident and said Sanderson was exploiting her wealth and celebrity. Sanderson is seeking $300,000, amended down from a previous request for $3.1 million. Paltrow is countersuing Sanderson for $1. Paltrow and Sanderson both dispute who hit whom and who was farther up the hill at the time of the crash. Deer Valley's website says the person ahead or downhill has the right of way. Sanderson's attorney, Lawrence Buhler, alleged in his opening statement that Paltrow was not looking in front of her as she was skiing downhill and instead was looking at her children, who were there with instructors. Buhler said the sole eyewitness to the crash, Craig Ramon, was in a group that went skiing with Sanderson and roughly 35 feet uphill at the time. Sanderson was not responsive after the crash, and Paltrow was able to get back up, Buhler said. One of the two instructors in Paltrow's party skied to them, along with Ramon, but is alleged to have left before Sanderson received medical aid. Ramon, who described himself as Sanderson's acquaintance, corroborated the allegations against Paltrow in his testimony. ""We were skiing down the run, and I heard this, this scream, and I looked over, and about one or two seconds ... I hear this scream, and I see this skier slam into the back of Terry,"" Ramon said Tuesday. Paltrow hit Sanderson ""hard"" and bounced off him, landing a few feet downhill to Sanderson's right, Ramon said. Once Ramon reached them, Paltrow got up but did not answer whether she was OK, he said. An instructor then approached the group and was ""very hostile"" to Sanderson, who was still facedown in the snow, Ramon said. ""He starts yelling at Terry, 'What did you do?' ... and Terry’s not moving, he’s facedown, and he keeps saying, 'What did you do?'"" Ramon said. Paltrow left the scene about three to four minutes after the crash, Ramon said, without identifying herself or asking whether anyone needed help. During that time, Ramon said, Sanderson was “out of it” and complained about his ribs. The instructor stayed a few moments longer, Ramon said, ""yanked"" Sanderson back up to his feet without checking for back or neck injuries and left shortly after. Ramon eventually flagged down a member of the resort's ski patrol, and staff members took Sanderson to a first aid station on a sled, he said. Stephen Owens, Paltrow's attorney, disputed the account in his opening statement. He alleged that Sanderson was the one who caused the accident because he was moving to avoid another skier and interlocked his skis with Paltrow's when he crashed into her from behind. Sanderson is alleged to have apologized to Paltrow at the time and to have told others he wasn't sure what happened, Owens told the jury. He said Paltrow stayed until a ski patrol from the resort came by and Sanderson said he was OK. Owens also alleged that Sanderson, now 76, had ailing health before the accident, including partial blindness and dementia. On cross-examination, Ramon clarified a previous statement, that the instructor told him Gwyneth Paltrow took out his ""buddy."" ""I get dyslexic when I get nervous,"" Ramon said. ""No, he said your buddy just took out Gwyneth."" Owens asked Ramon why he didn’t correct the instructor's assumption that Sanderson knocked into Paltrow. “He was yelling, and I didn’t want to get into an argument with him,” Ramon said. Paltrow’s attorney also pressed Ramon about the timeline and allegations of discrepancies between his previous statements and Tuesday’s testimony. On Tuesday, Owens read part of the deposition where Ramon answered that Sanderson said he was ""OK,"" but Ramon said Owens was taking it out of context. “I don’t think I understood your question, because he was never OK,” Ramon said. “He could hardly stand.” Ramon agreed during cross-examination that he was not solely focused on Sanderson while he was skiing before the crash, but he denied seeing a ski patrol member at the site of the collision. ""Do you acknowledge that you don't have a perfect memory and that some things may have been said that you don't remember?"" Owens asked. ""I pretty much remember,"" Ramon said. ""True or false: I have a perfect memory,"" Owens asked Ramon, who answered, ""False."" The trial is expected to last eight days, including testimony from medical professionals and Paltrow’s children. "
A landscape that generations of Latinos fought to preserve is now a national monument,Edwin Flores,"March 21, 2023, 11:36 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"A historical and ecologically rich swath of land in El Paso was designated a national monument by President Joe Biden on Tuesday. The announcement making Castner Range, an almost 7,000-acre landscape located along the Rio Grande, a national monument was lauded by residents and groups who have been advocating for its preservation for over a half-century. “After 52 years, and so many letters of support — a lot of work has been put into all this — from community members [to] staff volunteers,” Moses Borjas, a local pastor, told NBC News. Borjas is a member of Por La Creación Faith-Based Alliance, a group of religious leaders advocating for environmental preservation that is part of the Hispanic Access Foundation, a national nonprofit. Castner Range has been found to be the ancestral lands of several Indigenous groups, including the Comanche Nation and the Apache. Latino preservationists have long touted the land as still sacred to Native and Indigenous communities. It's the home of dozens of archaeological sites, as well as a wildlife habitat. But Castner Range, located on Fort Bliss, was also a training and testing site for the Army for decades until it closed in 1966. The area still has unexploded munitions. Castner Range will be under the control of the Army. ""Once the area is sufficiently remediated to be safe for public access, Castner Range will offer unique opportunities for the El Paso community to experience, explore, and learn from nature,"" according to a statement from the White House. In an area where more than 8 in 10 residents are Latino, groups have touted the importance of the landscape as a recreational space and a mental health resource. The area borders many communities that lack economic resources. ""We are eager for this dangerous and inaccessible landscape to become a safe and accessible region for respite for the first time in many generations,"" said in a statement Mark Magaña, CEO of the environmental advocacy group, Green Latinos. According to a report from the Hispanic Access Foundation, Latinos in El Paso living near Castner Range have disproportionately high rates of asthma and chronic diseases. The report found that designating the land as a national monument would help protect essential outdoor space and close the nature gap. “The challenges that our city has faced — such as poverty, pollution, inequality, climate change — are the results of broken relationships,"" said Maite Arce, president and CEO of Hispanic Access Foundation. ""Protecting Castner Range is not only protecting our mountains and wildlife but it’s protecting our history, heritage and our legacy.” Preservation efforts first began in the 1970s and calls to have the landscape designated as a landmark began about a decade ago. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, first introduced The Castner Range National Monument Act in 2021. For Latino communities, according to Borjas, the designation meant, “Your voice has been heard.” "
Louisville or London? U.S. Beyoncé fans share why they're opting for European tickets,Daysia Tolentino,"March 21, 2023, 2:57 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Tickets to see Beyoncé in the U.S. are so expensive that some American fans are flying to Europe instead. The number of American fans seeing concerts abroad was steadily increasing before the pandemic, but Ticketmaster’s recent controversies have highlighted the difficulties of the ticketing process domestically. With dynamic pricing jacking up the cost of concert tickets in the U.S. and young people increasingly spending money on experiences, seeing Beyoncé in Europe gives some fans more bang for their buck. In the last month, TikTok users have been demystifying the process of buying international tickets and making more consumers aware of the potential savings. Mercedes Arielle, a content creator, is no stranger to the strategy. In 2018, she saw Beyoncé and Jay-Z at the “On the Run II Tour” in Paris, securing floor seats for $92 apiece. In her hometown, Dallas, the going rate for the same tickets was $900 higher. This year, having witnessed the botched Taylor Swift “Eras Tour” rollout, Arielle said she had no desire to rely on Ticketmaster and the U.S. system. Arielle paid less for her international flight, her hotel stay and a Beyoncé ticket in Stockholm than her hometown friends paid to see the same show in Dallas. Her VIP tickets to the Stockholm show were $366. Even her hotel is “essentially free” because of points and miles. “Beyoncé is gonna sweat on me,” she said. “That’s how close I am.” Since she last traveled to Europe to see Beyoncé, Arielle has been sharing affordable luxury travel tips, like using points to purchase flights. “It’s really important to me to make people aware that living within your means does not mean that your lifestyle cannot be fabulous or that it can’t have these glowing moments that will be forever memories,” she said. “To me, the savings are priceless.” Others online agreed it can be more economical to splurge on a concert and a vacation than to pay a similar amount to watch the show in their hometowns. When Kylyn Schnelle, 28, looked at floor tickets for Beyoncé’s “Renaissance World Tour” stop in Louisville, Kentucky, where she lives, she found some seats that were being resold for over $800. Given the steep price tag, she decided to take a look at floor tickets in London to see whether she could find a better deal. “When I looked in London, it was 167 pounds [about $200], and the flight was, like, $660,” she said. “I was like this is genuinely the same cost.” Schnelle’s best friend lives in London, so, she said, it took “very little to convince” her to go. “If you’re going to spend $800, why would you not milk it as much as possible?” she said, adding that she has the privilege to travel abroad for concerts because she is young and single and has a job that gives her paid time off. Frustration at Ticketmaster, which has been embroiled in controversy after the November sale for Swift’s “Eras Tour,” has reached a fever pitch in recent months. The company has been criticized for its outsize role in the ticketing industry in the U.S. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in January, the company was questioned about the prevalence of bots, exorbitant fees and high prices. Ticketmaster’s use of dynamic pricing, which adjusts prices based on demand, has been particularly contentious among U.S. concertgoers. While it is increasingly used in the U.K. and certain other European countries, it is still less common, making the tickets more reasonable in the eyes of U.S. consumers. Schnelle posted a TikTok video sharing her European ticket-buying experience and praised the U.K. and Europe’s consumer protection laws. In the comments, some viewers shared similar experiences, while others expressed interest in exploring European options for future concerts. “I don’t think that what Ticketmaster has done in the United States post-pandemic is sustainable for their business, because they’ve made a lot of people upset,” Schnelle said. In addition, while ticket scalping remains a major problem in Europe, the U.K. and some other European countries limit resale prices, driving market prices down. Ticketmaster also faces more competitive pressure abroad, with Eventim and Dice serving as prominent primary ticket sellers in the region. A spokesperson for Ticketmaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment. I don’t think that what Ticketmaster has done in the United States post-pandemic is sustainable for their business because they’ve made a lot of people upset. — Kylyn Schnelle, a fan going to Beyoncé’s tour in london instead of her Hometown, louisville Sam Shemtob, the managing director of the ticket resale advocacy group Face-value European Alliance for Ticketing, said that ticketing platforms are able to implement caps in their resale policies but that the numbers vary across Europe. On the European ticket site Eventim, he said, resale tickets are capped at face value plus booking fees in the U.K. and at a 20% markup from face value in countries like the Netherlands. Conversely, he said, Germany has no limit on resale price increases on Eventim. “The laws are getting better across Europe in that they’re becoming more homogenized and more equal,"" Shemtob said. ""But at the moment, there are quite a few different laws in different member states.” Last year, the European Parliament passed the Digital Services Act, which includes ticket regulations and will take effect Jan. 1. Shemtob hopes it will create “a more level playing field in terms of both regulation and enforcement.” The DSA will require resellers to provide proof of identification and contact information, mandate the disclosure of third-party sellers on resale sites and ban “panic-buying” tactics, such as using timers. “We are exploring and trying to get a better understanding of how it will be enforced, because without enforcement, legislation is meaningless or almost meaningless,” said Shemtob, who said regulatory enforcement remains a problem in European countries. While the U.K. and the European Union are taking steps to address ticketing issues, fans might still be faced with high prices and confusing resale markups similar to those in the U.S., depending on the country. Shemtob said “consumer education is so important” when it comes to buying tickets and added that campaigns like “Make Tickets Fair!” provide resources about resale laws across the region. Jadrian Wooten, an associate professor of economics at Virginia Tech, said two primary behavioral factors lead consumers to spend hundreds of dollars on concert tickets, even if it is not in their best financial interest. The first is called “present bias,” the idea that we “heavily discount the future and prioritize things we’re doing today.” We know as consumers and as people who have lived through a pandemic that opportunities for certain experiences may not happen again, causing fans “to go to great lengths to do that today,” Wooten said. The second factor is that consumers base the value or the price of a product on experience, known as an “anchoring bias.” In the case of buying tickets to see industry titans through Ticketmaster, Beyoncé fans saw certain prices for Swift’s “Eras Tour” and adjusted their expectations and budgets accordingly. When Wooten first heard that U.S. fans were electing to travel to international shows for the same or cheaper tickets, he thought it was a “really creative way” to get two things for the price of one. “You’re bundling two experiences in one,” he said. “You’re getting both a concert experience and a trip that you maybe wanted to take anyway.” Some fans said their European ticket-buying strategy backfired. Jamaya Powell, 26, bought expensive Beyoncé tickets in Germany before she looked into flight prices, which she later realized she could not afford. Powell went viral on TikTok because she desperately tried to sell the two German tickets. “Online, I really couldn’t get a gauge of how much the tickets would be in the U.S,” said Powell, who lives in Atlanta. “I just considered because of everything that’s been happening that they would be really expensive. So I impulsively bought the tickets in Germany.” Powell bought dynamically priced tickets from Ticketmaster for 409 euros each. A friend who lives in Austria bought face-value tickets in the same section for a lower price. Powell was not aware of dynamic pricing at the time and says she felt “scammed by Ticketmaster.” She struggled to resell her tickets because she bought them over face value. Powell eventually sold the tickets at a loss, at 240 euros each. She also was able to secure two tickets in her hometown, Atlanta, for $741.60. “It’s hard to not be impulsive when, you know, you want to go to a concert that is very highly anticipated and that people are really interested in going to,” Powell said. “I would just say make smarter decisions than I did.""

Bad Bunny’s former girlfriend sues seeking $40M over voice recording,Associated Press,"March 21, 2023, 1:07 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Bad Bunny’s ex–girlfriend is suing the superstar for at least $40 million over a well-known voice recording she provided the singer before he became famous. Carliz De La Cruz Hernández, whose breathy “Bad Bunny, baby” recording was included in two of the artist’s songs, claimed in a lawsuit filed this month in a Puerto Rico court that her voice and the phrase she came up with are being used without her permission. The lawsuit, which was first reported by online Puerto Rico news site Noticel, notes that the phrase was used in the “Pa Ti,” song, which has more than 355 million views on YouTube and more than 235 million reproductions on Spotify. It also was used in the “Dos Mil 16” song, which has more than 60 million views on YouTube and 280 million reproductions on Spotify. The lawsuit states that De La Cruz’s “distinguishable voice” also has been used without her consent for songs, records, promotions, worldwide concerts, television, radio and social and musical platforms. “Since then, thousands of people have commented directly on Carliz’s social media networks, as well as every time she goes to a public place, about the ‘Bad Bunny, baby.’ This has caused, and currently causes, that De La Cruz feels worried, anguished, intimidated, overwhelmed and anxious,” the lawsuit states. Also sued is Noah Kamil Assad Byrne, manager for Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Martínez Ocasio. Assad and representatives of Bad Bunny did not immediately respond to a message for comment. De La Cruz and Martínez first became a couple in 2011. A year later, they began studying at the University of Puerto Rico in the north coastal town of Arecibo while also working at a nearby grocery store. The lawsuit stated that during that time, Martínez was constantly creating songs and rhythms and would seek opinions from De La Cruz, who also was in charge of scheduling his parties and handling invoices and contracts. The birth of the phrase, “Bad Bunny, baby,” came about in 2015, and Martínez asked De La Cruz to record herself saying it. She did so in a bathroom one day while staying with a friend because that’s where it was least noisy and then sent it to him, the lawsuit stated. On Jan. 1, 2016, Martínez asked De La Cruz to marry him, and they made plans to do so in July 2016. But in April 2016, Rimas Entertainment signed Martínez. That same year, De La Cruz was accepted into the University of Puerto Rico’s law school, and she ended her relationship with Martínez in May 2016. They got back together in 2017, but once again went their separate paths. Then in May 2022, a Bad Bunny representative reached out to De La Cruz, saying he needed to talk to her. “In that call, (the representative) said, ’I know you don’t like to talk about Voldemort (referring to Martínez), but I need to ask you something,” the lawsuit stated. He offered her $2,000 to buy the recording of her voice. De La Cruz declined and then spoke with someone at Rimas Entertainment who also offered to buy it, saying the recording would be used in the upcoming album, “Un Verano Sin Ti,” the lawsuit stated. But a deal was never reached, and the song was published without De La Cruz’s consent, according to the lawsuit. "
Will Sharpe of 'White Lotus' to direct 'Crying in H Mart' film adaptation,Kimmy Yam,"March 20, 2023, 7:42 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Will Sharpe, of HBO’s “White Lotus,” is pivoting back to the director’s chair. Sharpe is set to direct the upcoming film adaptation of musician Michelle Zauner’s 2021 memoir “Crying in H Mart.” Sharpe said in a statement to NBC News on Monday that he’s “excited to be back on the other side of the camera.” “I was a fan of Michelle’s music and found ‘Crying In H Mart’ to be a beautiful, relatable work of light handed honesty,” Sharpe said in a statement. It was initially announced in 2021 that the memoir, which heavily centers on Zauner’s relationship with her Korean immigrant mother, Chongmi, as they contend with her terminal cancer diagnosis, would be adapted. Zauner, who performs under the name Japanese Breakfast, said in a statement provided to NBC News that she was “relieved” to have added Sharpe to the project. “It was a daunting task, to find someone I could trust with the retelling of such a personal story,” Zauner said. “Someone who could honor my mother’s character and respect the darkest days of grief, and still make the coming of age of a half-Korean artsy outsider in a small Pacific Northwest hippie town seem real and cool.” Sharpe, who is best known for his role as tech entrepreneur Ethan in the HBO drama, has had previous directing experience with “Flowers,” a British black comedy-drama. “I believe his sensitivity, as a director and an actor, and his own personal experience, having grown up between two cultures, will be tremendous assets,” Zauner said, referencing Sharpe’s multiracial Japanese background. Much of Zauner’s memoir, which expands on her 2018 New Yorker essay of the same name, deals with sensitive subjects, including the cultural tensions within her mixed race family, as well as the grief and mourning that followed her mother’s death. She previously told NBC News that much of the grieving process meant “lamenting having a tough relationship” with her mother. “I wasn’t a perfect daughter, either, and she was absolutely not a perfect mother,” she said. “But, you know, I don’t think that you would find any mother-daughter relationship that is really like that.” "
"'Joy Ride' trailer promises misadventure, scandal and 'The Hangover' for Asians",Sakshi Venkatraman,"March 20, 2023, 7:11 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Featuring a powerhouse cast of Asian actors, the trailer for the raunchy comedy “Joy Ride” dropped over the weekend, and fans are already buzzing with excitement ahead of its release this summer. Starting off with a bang (a 5-year-old Asian girl cursing out and punching a white classmate who calls her a racial slur), the film’s trailer centers on the friendship between characters Audrey (Ashley Park) and Lolo (Sherry Cola). Reminiscent of an Asian version of “The Hangover,” the story follows the two women as they journey to China in search of adoptee Audrey’s birth mother. While there, the two meet up with Audrey’s college roommate Kat (Oscar nominee Stephanie Hsu) and Lolo’s cousin Deadeye (Sabrina Wu). Traversing China together, the four find themselves meeting hot guys, having their passports stolen, masquerading as K-pop stars, and inadvertently getting caught up in drug smuggling. “For us to get to do this raunchy, balls to the wall, rated R, wild, unhinged movie, I feel like we have permission to do this and to make a mess and to not be precious with our identity,” Hsu said in a cast interview at the film’s South by Southwest premiere. “Our movie is not about so much more. It’s just a fun time.” Set to release on July 7, the film is helmed by “Crazy Rich Asians” writer Adele Lim in her directorial debut. It’s produced by Seth Rogen, and features cameos by Ronny Chieng, Desmond Chiam and Chris Pang. It’s unabashedly sexual, which Cola believes is one of its most important aspects. Given Asian womens’ historical exoticization and fetishization in Western media, “Joy Ride” is a chance to rewrite the narrative. “Historically, it’s always been so extreme,” Cola said during the interview. “This film is about reclaiming our sexuality and telling that story through our own lens, through our own mouths and through our own bodies. I think that’s the number one goal here, to kind of redefine the box we’ve been put in.” In a media landscape that’s so often served audiences Asians as stereotypes or side roles, a carefree movie with Asian main characters is monumental, cast members said. “We’re all very used to being supporting characters,” Park said. “We were like, ‘Oh my gosh, it feels like we’ve been filming a different movie every day, like a different genre.’ And we were like, ‘I guess that’s what being the protagonist in your own story feels like.’” "
What a TikTok ban would mean for users,Uwa Ede-Osifo,"March 17, 2023, 6:52 PM UTC / Updated March 20, 2023, 4:46 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The Biden administration has presented Chinese company ByteDance with an ultimatum: sell your popular video-sharing app, TikTok, or be banned nationwide. TikTok has not yet indicated it will sell, but has attempted to persuade U.S. officials that they can address security concerns and meet the level of proposed scrutiny. TikTok’s CEO has argued a ban would not address security concerns. But what would a ban mean for consumers? Is there any precedent for such a ban? NBC News spoke with four people who have studied cybersecurity, national security and technology policy who offered some ideas about how a TikTok ban could work. It’s not clear how the U.S. would institute a ban. The White House’s best chance to do that would likely come from a bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators last week that has strong White House support. While the senators behind the bill introduced it as a way to potentially ban TikTok, it isn’t clear exactly how that would happen. It would give the Secretary of Commerce a broader power to ban foreign technology in cases in which the U.S. believed it posed a national security threat. How that authority would be wielded is still up for debate, however. A spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined to discuss details on how the agency is considering that power. The easiest mechanism for the government to enforce a ban would be to prohibit the app stores from making TikTok available to download, said Darrell M. West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution Center for Technology Innovation. The app could lose functionality over time. “If there’s a ban, there would definitely be no more updates and software enhancements, and over time, it becomes harder to use those apps,” West said. The use of TikTok could also potentially be criminalized, resulting in fines, said Ahmed Ghappour, professor of law at Boston University. This has been done in the past with other banned software that was flagged as a national security threat. Though he said no such software has been “as mainstream as TikTok.” Possibly. An app store ban would leave the app intact on phones where it was already downloaded. Theoretically, those apps would still be operational. The government cannot force people to remove the app, West said. There is uncertainty about what the app would look like for those grandfathered in — if existing users could log in and still access video-sharing and browsing capabilities. But the U.S. could theoretically go farther than that by forcing internet providers to block the app. India is the largest country to have entirely banned TikTok, having blocked dozens of mostly Chinese apps in 2020. Shortly following the ban, India’s Department of Telecommunications ordered internet and wireless service providers to block the apps, TikTok among them. Soon after that, some TikTok users in India said the app no longer had any functionality. The U.S. has never issued a blanket ban on an app. TikTok has been the subject of a variety of smaller restrictions. Many public universities have restricted access to the social media app from school-owned devices and campus Wi-Fi networks, and states have prohibited government-issued devices from having the app downloaded. The U.S. did force the sale of an app. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) regularly reviews foreign-owned companies to determine if their business and transactions pose a threat to national security. In 2019, CFIUS forced a Chinese company to divest ownership of the dating app Grindr. If the U.S. moves to completely block the app, there is a possibility that the use of a VPN (virtual private network) could provide access to the app. Virtual private networks are services that allow users to redirect their internet connection through other networks. They’re often used to get around certain types of internet censorship. “There are virtual networks that allow people to get access to Western applications,” West said. Americans could use the same to access TikTok. A ban would be difficult to enforce, he added, because there are always loopholes. Still, the government could target VPN access to make the ban effective. Officials could “ban VPN use or compel VPN companies to have a blacklist of sites that they will not permit the flow of traffic to,” Ghappour said. Other experts said that while there could be workarounds to the ban, they may not be sustainable due to the popularity of the app. “There really wouldn’t be a way to circumvent the ban. The market is too big,” said Elly Rostoum, a political scientist and lecturer at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “We’re talking about a third of the United States population that uses TikTok.” It would not. “The ban does not address the key problem that TikTok poses, which is transfer of data,” Rostoum said. “There will be another company that’s owned by a Chinese company that can transfer the data.” Other experts were in agreement. “TikTok is just the tip of the iceberg,” said James Lewis, a technology expert at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. “Many products have Chinese software.” Beyond data privacy concerns with Chinese-owned companies, the U.S. has no overarching federal data privacy law, and data brokers freely buy and sell users’ data with very little oversight. And TikTok’s access to user information isn’t unique — most smartphone apps harvest data from users’ phones. "
Bruce Willis' family opens up about 'grief' they feel on his 68th birthday,"Francesca Gariano, TODAY","March 20, 2023, 11:14 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"Bruce Willis’ family members are speaking candidly about the grief they feel on the actor’s birthday this year, as it falls just one month after he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. In a video posted on Sunday on Instagram, the actor’s wife, Emma Heming Willis, shared an emotional video about honoring Bruce Willis’ 68th birthday amid his recent health issues. “Today is my husband’s birthday. I have started the morning by crying, as you can see by my swollen eyes and snotty nose,” she said to begin the video. “I just think it’s important that you see all sides of this.” Heming Willis shared that she often receives messages that tell her “I don’t know how you do this,” to which she responds, “I’m not given a choice. I wish I was, but I’m also raising two kids in this, so sometimes in our lives, we have to put our big girl panties on and get to it.” “I do have times of sadness, every day,” she said. “Grief, every day. And I’m really feeling it today on his birthday.” The 44-year-old model shared that the emotions came about while she was editing a video she planned on sharing for her husband’s birthday. “I don’t know why I do that to myself because the videos are like a knife in my heart,” she explained. “But as much as I do it for myself, I do it for you, because I know how much you love my husband and it means so much to me, so thank you.” In a second post shared on Instagram, Heming Willis shared the video she was editing, which included a montage of clips set to Stevie Wonder’s song “As.” “My birthday wish for Bruce is that you continue to keep him in your prayers and highest vibrations because his sensitive Pisces soul will feel it,” she wrote in the caption. “Thank you so much for loving and caring for him too.” Bruce Willis’ 31-year-old daughter, Scout LaRue Willis — who he shares with his ex-wife Demi Moore — also shared a touching post for her father’s birthday on Instagram. She posted a throwback photo of her sitting on her dad’s shoulders with her cheek resting against the top of his head. In her caption, she asked fans to send “love, tenderness, care, and prayer” to her father, who she called “one of my best friends, the Pisces king, the master of duality, both action hero icon and gentle girl dad.” “What a privilege to have this man as my father and learn so much about life, joy, mischief and art through him,” she added. Scout Willis acknowledged that this birthday was not an “easy day” because it was one that is full of “deep love” adding that “our grief really does show us the depth of our loving for someone.” “Grief is a price I’ll always pay to know what it is to feel such love,” she wrote. “I’m sending my love to anyone who has ever felt the capacity stretched by the enormity of love and humanness of grief.” Tallulah Willis, the actor’s 29-year-old daughter who he also shares with Moore, posted several throwback photos of her dad and one selfie with him on Instagram to mark his birthday. “feeling awash with all the good energies and love headed this Willis way!” she wrote. “I love him and he loves me — what a delight!” In March 2022, the family announced that Bruce Willis was diagnosed with aphasia and that he’d be stepping away from acting. Less than a year later, his family shared in a joint statement that he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, known as FTD. This condition is a less common type of dementia that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. In March, after attending a gala for the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, Heming Willis shared her appreciation for the support that has been sent to her husband and family. “Thank you for welcoming me @theaftd to my new home,” she wrote on Instagram. “It’s not the room I ever dreamed of being in but let me tell you, it’s a room of fierce love and resilience. I’m here to join the cause alongside all of you.” "
Adam Sandler takes home Mark Twain Prize for American Humor,The Associated Press,"March 20, 2023, 10:06 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"WASHINGTON — Adam Sandler placed his hand on the bronze bust of Mark Twain and speculated that it “one day might be the weapon used to bludgeon me in my sleep.” A host of comedic and entertainment royalty gathered at Washington’s Kennedy Center as Sandler was presented with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on Sunday. Presenters including Drew Barrymore, Conan O’Brien, Chris Rock, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Buscemi, Dana Carvey, and Luis Guzmán gave testimonials to Sandler’s creative longevity, while poking occasional fun at his uneven movie output and tendency to cast all his friends in his movies. Sandler’s longtime writing and production partner Tim Herlihy joked that the pair were responsible for “31 motion pictures with a combined Rotten Tomatoes score of 59.” Buscemi, known largely for dramatic and often violent roles, portrayed a string of comedic characters in Sandler movies. “He takes his comedy very seriously. I laugh hard at everything I do with him,” he said. Buscemi also singled out Sandler’s musical comedy, including “The Chanukah Song,” which became a multiplatinum hit. “His comedy songs alone deserve this reward,” he said. Judd Apatow, Sandler’s roommate during their early days in Los Angeles, recalled a young Sandler’s boundless confidence and obvious talent. “The moment you met him, you knew Adam was going to be a big star,” Apatow said. “And so did Adam.” To highlight Sandler’s seemingly limitless comedic energy, Apatow played an old video he recorded of a young Sandler prank-calling a local deli in his spare time to try out different comedic voices. At the end of the night, Sandler paid tribute to his parents and siblings for arming him with “that weird irrational confidence thing that I guess I still have."" Sandler, 56, first came to national attention as a cast member on “Saturday Night Live.” After being fired from the cast following a five-year stint, Sandler launched a wildly successful movie career that has spanned more than 30 films, grossing over $3 billion worldwide. Sandler’s top hits include “Happy Gilmore,” “The Wedding Singer” and “You Don’t Mess with the Zohan.” Although primarily known for slapstick comedy and overgrown man-child characters, he has excelled in multiple dramatic roles in films such as “Punch Drunk Love” and “Uncut Gems.” Guzman, who co-starred in “Punch Drunk Love,” admitted he originally thought Sandler was “out of his depth” in a dramatic role scripted by auteur director Paul Thomas Anderson. But he came away impressed and praised Sandler’s “total commitment to something that was so far our of his element.” Other comedians who received the lifetime achievement award include inaugural honoree Richard Pryor in 1998, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chapelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, saw his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault. The comedy institution “SNL” has provided more than its share of the 24 Mark Twain recipients. Sandler is the seventh cast member to receive the prize, joining Bill Murray, Tina Fey, Will Farrell, Billy Crystal, Eddie Murphy, Julia Louise-Dreyfus. Show creator and producer Lorne Michaels won in 2004. The ceremony will be broadcast nationally on CNN on March 26. "
Jason Sudeikis and 'Ted Lasso' cast members to visit White House,Peter Alexander,"March 19, 2023, 11:58 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"The cast of hit show ""Ted Lasso"" is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss efforts to address mental health needs with President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden. According to an Apple TV+ statement, the visitors will include the Emmy-winning comedian and actor Jason Sudeikis, who plays the show's namesake soccer coach. The pandemic-era show often includes themes of optimism, kindness and determination. The character Dani Rojas, a soccer pro coached by Lasso, made the saying “Fútbol is life!” into a catch phrase in 2021. Biden has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in federal, state and local efforts to better deal with mental health issues in the U.S. Calling the state of the nation's mental health a crisis after the coronavirus pandemic curtailed socializing and made many workers and children homebound, Biden last year argued for a major taxpayer investment in solutions. The administration has put federal money behind expanding school-based mental health treatment and training first responders in how to respond to people in mental health emergencies. ""Mental health affects all of us,"" Biden said in a statement in October. ""We can and must do more to transform how we address mental health in America."" "
'Jurassic Park’ star Sam Neill reveals he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"Chrissy Callahan, TODAY","March 18, 2023, 12:36 AM UTC",Culture Matters,"While Sam Neill was promoting “Jurassic World Dominion“ in 2022, he was facing challenging circumstances behind the scenes. Neill, 75, recently revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage three non-Hodgkin lymphoma while promoting the film a year ago. He underwent treatment and is now in remission. The star broke the news in a new interview with the BBC and explained what was going on in his mind when he first got the diagnosis. “I thought, ‘I’m crook, I’m dying,’” he said. The actor revealed that he initially spotted some bumpy glands in his neck during a publicity tour for “Jurassic World Dominion.” According to the National Cancer Institute, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates in the lymph system, which is part of the immune system. When non-Hodgkin lymphoma reaches stage three, the institute says on its website, cancer is found in “groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm” or “in lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the spleen.” Looking back on the experience, Neill said he was “pretty phlegmatic” when he received the diagnosis but he did realize he should “take stock of things.” “I thought I need to do something, and I thought, ‘Shall I start writing?’” he said. Neill decided to write a memoir titled “Did I Ever Tell You This?” and said the process of penning the book gave him “a reason to get through the day” while he had cancer. “I didn’t think I had a book in me, I just thought I’d write some stories. And I found it increasingly engrossing,” he said. The book, which does address Neill’s cancer, will be released in late March, and the actor said he wrote it alone without the help of a ghost writer. He’s also quite proud of how quickly he finished the project. “I suspect my publishers, they’re delightful people, but I think they wanted to get it out in a hurry just in case I kicked the bucket before it was time to release the thing,” he joked. Now that he’s in remission, Neill said he has gained new perspective on life. “I’m not afraid of dying,” he explained. “What I don’t want to do is to stop living, because I really enjoy living.” Still, he is excited to shed some of the unpleasant side effects of his cancer treatment: hair loss, for example. “More than anything I want my beard back. I don’t like the look of my face one bit,” he said. While reflecting on his cancer journey, Neill said it’s been “an adventure, quite a dark adventure, but an adventure nevertheless. “And the good days are just fantastic and when you get some good news,” he said, “it’s absolutely exhilarating.” "
"After hearing of Biden’s potential TikTok ban, some users say they’re not worried (yet)",Kalhan Rosenblatt,"March 17, 2023, 10:45 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"Their favorite app might get banned — but instead of panicking, some TikTok users said they remain unfazed. NBC News reported this week, citing a source close to the company, that the Biden administration is threatening to potentially ban TikTok in the U.S. if the app’s Chinese owners refuse to sell their stakes. When asked by NBC News about the threat, a handful of young users shared a similar sentiment: They’re not taking it seriously. The online response appears to be less severe than when then-President Donald Trump and his administration floated a ban. “This same thing happened a while back,” Haley Kowtko, 19, of California, said via text message. “Not many people are talking about it, especially on the app. I haven’t seen anything about the app being potentially banned.” That’s not to say that some people aren’t reacting on the app. The hashtag #DontBanTikTok had more than 93.2 million views, with some videos dating back to 2020 and others uploaded this week following reports of the Biden administration’s move. A TikTok spokesperson confirmed Friday that a handful of creators are planning an off-app protest in Washington, D.C., for Wednesday, hoping to bring their concerns to the Biden administration’s doorstep. But the current sentiment among users serves as a stark contrast to the previous proposed ban by the Trump administration. At that time, one creator said they’d “never seen that many people talking about one thing on the app for so long.” “I think because we all freaked out before and nothing happened, no one is taking it seriously,” Kowtko said. Jacqueline Metzger, 17, said she was “a little surprised” when she heard of the potential ban. But she said losing TikTok would likely give way to another new platform or would make an existing platform more popular, just like TikTok filled the void left behind by the former short-form video app Vine. “If TikTok is banned, someone is going to come up with an alternative. There are so many TikTok alternatives already, like YouTube shorts and Instagram reels,” Metzger said. “It’s everywhere, so I’m not too worried about that.” This time around, there is also less of a fear among creators: Some have already been branching out beyond TikTok to broaden their following. “I don’t see this happening soon or the near-term horizon, and creators since 2020 have been really savvy about being on multiple platforms and doing short-form video on multiple different places,” said Mae Karwowski, founder and CEO of the influencer marketing agency Obviously. “It’s less damaging than the initial story of 2020.” She said the vibe among users and content creators on TikTok is currently “cautiously optimistic.” I think the app will be around one way or another. I just don’t think it will be owned by ByteDance. Gigi Robinson, 24, a content creator and Gen Z motivational public speaker TikTok creator Marcus DiPaola, who has amassed 3.8 million followers, said he noticed waves of panic pricking up among creators who feared losing their platform. DiPaola, who is known for posting videos about current events, said he had seen “countless TikToks” of creators urging followers to subscribe to their other platforms, just in case the platform vanished. However, DiPaola said he’s among the less worried crowd of users. “I’m on a bunch of platforms,” he said. “If TikTok is banned, it would suck, but I’m not screwed.” Others on the app said they aren’t concerned because they think TikTok could get sold to a U.S.-based company, meaning it wouldn’t disappear completely. “I’m not genuinely worried at all,” said Gigi Robinson, 24, a content creator and Gen Z motivational public speaker. She referenced when Microsoft was in the running to acquire TikTok when Trump attempted to ban the app. “I think the app will be around one way or another,” she said. “I just don’t think it will be owned by ByteDance.” "
"'The Wire' star Lance Reddick dies from natural causes at 60, publicist says",Diana Dasrath,"March 17, 2023, 7:46 PM UTC / Updated March 17, 2023, 10:03 PM UTC",Culture Matters,"LOS ANGELES — ""The Wire"" star Lance Reddick, 60, died Friday, his publicist said. Mia Hansen, the actor's publicist, said Reddick ""passed away suddenly"" and that it was from ""natural causes."" She did not provide further details. ""Lance will be greatly missed. Please respect his family’s privacy at this time,"" Hansen said in a statement. The Baltimore native was best known for his portrayal of a hometown police lieutenant, Cedric Daniels, in the acclaimed HBO drama ""The Wire,"" which ran from 2002 to 2008. He was also featured in the ""John Wick"" movie franchise. His career started with small roles, including parts in the Denzel Washington movie ""The Siege"" in 1998, and on television's ""West Wing"" in the late '90s and into the early '00s. About the same time, HBO's ""Oz"" showcased Reddick's acting chops as he portrayed a Jamaican drug dealer who turned out to be an undercover police detective who had infiltrated the criminal underworld. Reddick also had a recurring role on television's ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit."" But it was as the incorruptible Lt. Daniels that Riddick achieved stardom. His cop was calculating, fair and unafraid of a power structure that could work against public safety. His defining moment came when the city's mayor asked for more favorable crime data. Reddick's performance opened for him network television roles (""Lost,"" ""Fringe"") and big-screen hits (""White House Down""). He also starred in ""Bosch."" Most recently, Reddick starred as Charon in the John Wick movie franchise. The movie's stars are in the midst of a press tour for ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" ahead of its March 24 release. On Friday, fellow ""Wire"" actor Wendell Pierce (Det. Bunk Moreland) tweeted, in part, ""As talented a musician as he was an actor. The epitome of class. Godspeed my friend. You made your mark here."" ""Bosch"" creator Michael Connelly tweeted, ""More than being a key ingredient in the Bosch show, he was a wonderful person, friend and collaborator. He took a character who was paper-thin in the books and made Irvin Irving."" Comedian and television writer Mike Drucker said Reddick's voice ""could cut through steel."" ""This dude made every movie and show he was in better,"" he tweeted. Reddick's parents were educators: His father taught high school English and social studies; his mother was a music instructor. He followed his mother's passion, studying classical piano at the Quaker high school he attended before enrolling at the University of Rochester and then at the prestigious Eastman School of Music. He didn't finish, and his big-stage aspirations didn't materialize. Reddick tried acting and applied to Yale to study drama. He was accepted, a moment described in an official biography as a surprise. It helped to bring Reddick to the world after he scored an understudy role on the Broadway hit ""Angels in America."" He is survived by his wife, Stephanie Reddick, and children Yvonne Nicole and Christopher Reddick. "
